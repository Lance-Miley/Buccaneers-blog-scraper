https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/sounds-like-shaq-barrett-is-considering-multiple-options/|Sounds Like Shaq Barrett Is Considering Multiple Options|Is Bucs sacks king Shaq Barrett injured or recovering from something? Buccaneers outside linebackers coach Larry Foote seemed to imply that yesterday when Joe asked him whether he’s talking ball with Shaq like he is with Chris Braswell. Foote said the following of Shaq: “He’s around … he’s getting some treatment. I know that’s funny when the year ends, you can’t be back in the building. [He] don’t live that far from me so he’s just rehabbing. And uh, hopefully… I don’t know the future with him. He could be back here or somewhere else so, but we’ll always be in contact.” Shaq, 32, is a free agent. After retiring in July, walking away from a fat contract with Miami, Shaq wanted to play again and the Dolphins cut him. That let the Bucs swoop in and add Shaq to their roster in late December. It was a desperation move for a Bucs team looking at any angle to find edge rusher help. Obviously, Foote’s comments are open to interpretation. But Buccaneers Ring of Honor general manager Jason Licht said at the NFL Scouting Combine that he’d love to have Shaq back on the team. The holdup, Joe suspects, is Shaq wants more than the very low salary plus incentives that the Bucs are offering. Or, whatever Shaq is “rehabbing” is more than routine veteran maintenance.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/keep-your-confidence/|“Keep Your Confidence”|Joe has to draw the line somewhere when it comes to how a team spins the performance of a player. For 2024 rookie edge rusher Chris Braswell, there has been a lot of talk about how he significantly upped his game late last season and that he’s poised to have a strong 2025. There’s so much faith in Braswell that Buccaneers Ring of Honor general manager Jason Licht even said he believes Braswell will “shock” fans next season. Joe can’t make the leap that Licht and Todd Bowles have. Braswell was active but did not take defensive snaps against the Commanders in the playoffs. In fact, his playing time waned late last season. Braswell logged just 26 snaps through the final four games of the regular season. His first sack and only full sack came in Week 16 against the Panthers. Does that sound like an ascending player? Not in Joe’s book, especially given Bucs sacks king Shaq Barrett was signed in late December in hopes he could give the edge rush a jolt. Still, Braswell is 23 years old with plenty of potential. Braswell’s new position coach, Larry Foote, said yesterday he’s counseling Braswell to keep his chin up. “‘Keep your confidence.’ … Come back focused. Come back confident.'” Foote acknowledged Braswell didn’t achieve what was expected from the second-round draft pick. “‘Don’t let, you know, the lack of production — your expectations didn’t get met — but you can come back next year and you can achieve all those goals,'” Foote said he told Braswell. Per Foote, performance of a Year 3 edge rusher reveals what the team really has in the player. But Joe can’t buy that 100 percent, and it certainly was an interesting take considering the Bucs banked on Joe Tryon-Shoyinka in his Year 4 (after a shaky third season). Regardless, Joe is rooting for Braswell. What a bonus it would be if he makes a healthy handful of plays next season.|2025-03-15 12:36:00|327|53|5|Chris Braswell|Inconsistencies in perceptions of player's potential.|4|Mix of concerns and optimism about Braswell's performance, development, draft picks, and coaching.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""John Sinclear"", ""post"": ""Rookie edge rusher.

I\u2019m rooting for Braswell but I didn\u2019t like the pick and don\u2019t see him reaching even JTS levels of useful/lessness let alone breaking out after getting used to the speed of the NFL game.  The Rams got a ready to roll week one source of havoc in Jared Verse but he only had 4.5 sacks as DROY but between the Rams first and second round picks they got a total of 13 rookie sacks once you add Braden Fiske\u2019s 8.5. There is no Von Miller or Micah Parsons in this draft but if the Bucs can pair Ezreiuaku with one of the many stud DTs projected to go early or ideally J J Pegues in the third and Yahya Black in the fifth they could chip their way to getting double digit sacks out of rookies and a few more out of Hall, Vea, Diaby and Reddick and Kancy by having the bodies to spell them without much drop off in mass, speed and fury.  Pegues has some of the most fun film I\u2019ve ever seen. Ole Miss has a heck of a haul of defenders getting drafted this year and every time I\u2019m trying to watch Amos or Paul my eye keeps moving to this bouncey bowling ball of razor blades DT who also has a full repertoire of RB skills.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/larry-foote-discusses-bucs-plans-for-haason-reddick/|Larry Foote Discusses Bucs Plans For Haason Reddick|So when Haason Reddick and the Bucs came to a contract agreement, Reddick wanted to know what the Bucs wanted from him and how he would be used. That’s only fair. So Reddick spoke with Todd Bowles and outside linebackers coach Larry Foote, who was Reddick’s position coach in Arizona. How would Bowles and Foote use him? Reddick wanted to know. Yesterday, Foote attended Reddick’s press conference and Joe asked him about that conversation. Foote chuckled about the entire conversation. “Oh, that’s real easy: Be a pass rusher,” Foote laughed. “I was laughing when he started asking me those types of questions. And I said, ‘Well, what do you want to do?'” Reddick told Foote he wanted to get after the quarterback. “That’s what we’re going to do,” Foote told Reddick. Foote said Reddick’s responsibilities wouldn’t be complicated. “That’s an easy position [edge rusher],” Foote told Reddick. “We want you to get after the quarterback.” Bowles will move Reddick around to drill quarterbacks. “And you know Bowles, we are flexible,” Foote said. “We will move you all around. And [Reddick] has that ability. That’s what he brings. “He’s not just a standard defensive end. We can move him all over the place and try to feature him.” It almost sounds like Bowles and Foote will use Reddick like Cowboys use Micah Parsons. The beauty of Parsons is that offenses don’t know from play to play where he will come from. If Reddick can attack from multiple positions, it’s almost delicious to think of how Bowles may use him. Just so long as Bowles doesn’t have Reddick covering Drake London.|2025-03-15 11:00:00|269|28|9|Haason Reddick|Reddick joins Bucs as versatile pass rusher under Bowles and Foote.|6|Comments have mixed sentiments ranging from optimism to slight skepticism.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Lt.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/chris-godwin-fans-drive-him-to-keep-no-14/|Chris Godwin: Fans Drive Me To Keep No. 14|So one-time Pro Bowl receiver Chris Godwin entered the NFL addicted to greatness and his beloved No. 12. That was Godwin’s number at Penn State and a number he talked about being important to him. “CG12” was part of his identity. Then along came Tom Brady, the greatest No. 12 in NFL history. Godwin handed over his number and switched to No. 14. In typical Godwin fashion, it seemed to be a move all about respect. There was never any mention about Brady buying the number from Godwin. And yes, both were asked about it at the time. Fast forward to this week and WDAE host Tom Krasniqi asked Godwin about whether he would switch back to No. 12. Godwin said it isn’t happening. Why? Because too many fans have purchased No. 14 jerseys, he replied, and Godwin doesn’t want to disappoint them and disrespect their support.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/larry-foote-thinks-he-knows-why-lavonte-david-returned/|Larry Foote Thinks He Knows Why Lavonte David Returned|Bucs fans were sweating right down to the last moment when Bucs icon Lavonte David decided to return for the 2025 season. So what were Bucs coaches thinking? Yesterday when the Bucs made newly-signed edge rusher Haason Reddick available to media, outside linebackers coach Larry Foote was hanging around. Foote took time to chat with a few in the local pen and mic club. Joe asked Foote how concerned he was that David might retire and what the vibe was with the rest of the Bucs coaches regarding David. Foote said in recent seasons David was playing very coy with coaches, including this offseason. “The last three years he had a poker face,” Foote said. “I’d try to squeeze it out of him and he’d be laughing. He’d say, ‘I will let you know.’ “The last three years I had no idea. But I kind of had [a hunch this winter].” So what was Foote’s hunch? He knew David was getting close to a standard set by Bucs Hall of Fame linebacker Derrick Brooks. Foote thought the mark was regular-season games played. Foote believed David could break that this year. Well, Joe looked it up. Brooks played 224 games for the Bucs. David has 198. So David would have to play through the 2026 season to snap Brooks’ record for games played by a Bucs linebacker. Rondé Barber holds the franchise record with 241 regular season games played. For David to break that, he’d have to play 44 more games. That would mean David would have to play in 2027 — and hope he doesn’t miss games due to an injury. David playing through 2027 without missing games due to injury seems a bridge too far for Joe. Apparently, per Foote, David would consider it a high honor to be mentioned in the same sentence as Brooks, or to have a franchise mark better than Brooks. “When I knew that, I said, ‘Oh, yeah. He’s coming back.'” Joe remembers last year when Foote thought David was gone. Foote congratulated David on Instagram for a fantastic career, wishing David success in his after-football goal of starting a ministry. Instead, David had an ace up his sleeve on Foote and returned.|2025-03-15 08:00:00|369|25|7|Lavonte David|Lavonte David considered breaking franchise records for career games played.|2|Mixed sentiments with mentions of respect for Lavonte David but concerns about team weaknesses.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""KABucs"", ""post"": ""Just glad he\u2019s here, and hoping he plays at the same impressive level\u2026 praying for no injuries.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/can-the-drought-be-snapped/|Can The Drought Be Snapped?|Joe didn’t know the drought was this short. Seemed like it began a decade ago. Who knew that when Bucs sacks king Shaq Barrett racked up 10 sacks in 2021 as the Bucs tried to run it back for a second-straight Super Bowl-winning season, the Bucs would stop having a guy who had double-digit sacks. But that’s what happened. It seemed like the Bucs were ready to have a guy grab the baton from Shaq and be the team’s sack artist. But Joe Tryon-Shoyinka, drafted 32nd overall in 2021, never panned out. He signed with Cleveland this week. Mike Jones of The Athletic seems to be a big believer that newly signed edge rusher Haason Reddick should snap that ugly streak. Or at least come close. Jones gave the Bucs a “B” for signing Reddick, and Jones seems to blame Reddick for his 2024 holdout and never gelling with the Jets. Jones has the Reddick signing as the 25th-best signing this past week. Joe’s goal for Reddick is 10 sacks; that’s all there is to it. If he could get 12, that would be fantastic. Shoot, eight would be an upgrade. If Reddick has 12, that tells Joe others on the Bucs’ front line of the pass rush are getting after quarterbacks, too. If Reddick has 12 sacks, teams will start shading coverage to try to slow him down. And that means less manpower devoted to blocking Vita Vea, Calijah Kancey and YaYa Diaby.
