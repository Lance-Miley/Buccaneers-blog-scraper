https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/liam-coen-theres-no-need-to-rip-baker-mayfield-during-a-game/|Liam Coen: No Need To “Rip” Baker Mayfield During A Game|As we saw recently with Bengals coach Zac Taylor and superstar quarterback Joe Burrow, it’s not uncommon for an offensive coordinator/head coach and a team’s starting quarterback to get into a cussing contest on the sideline. Joe is just going to guess that Taylor wasn’t asking Burrow about the whereabouts of Burrow’s high-profile domestic “employee.” Now Bucs offensive coordinator Liam Coen can get feisty, too. He just doesn’t show it much. Joe has seen Coen bark and curse during a training camp practice a few times when his offense doesn’t get a play down right. Joe’s even witnessed Coen order his offense to get their backsides back in the huddle, call and run a play again to his satisfaction and exacting standards. During games? Joe has yet to see Coen unload on Baker Mayfield. In explaining how Mayfield was a reason (but not the reason) Coen chose the Bucs, he explained today he knows Mayfield well enough that going full-blown Bobby Knight on him on the sidelines in a game won’t accomplish much. “Over the last few weeks, even when there are mistakes or things happen, you don’t need to rip him during a game,” Coen said. “He’s kind of ticked [off] enough. You have enough communication where you let him cool off, talk to other people, and then come back together to collaborate on things. “It’s been a great collaboration with him over the last few weeks, really over the whole year.” In fact, Coen explained the respect he has for Mayfield may also explain why Coen isn’t moved to freak out on Mayfield in the middle of a game. When Mayfield is on his game, Coen suggested, there are very few quarterbacks he’d rather work with. “When he plays like he did [against Los Angeles], when his feet, timing, rhythm, and everything is calm – everything is good – there aren’t many people that can throw it as [well] as him,” Coen said. Many NFL people think the best thing that could have happened to Mayfield was escaping Cleveland, surviving Carolina and finding himself surrounded by quality teammates in Tampa. The way Mayfield has played this year, perhaps even better for Mayfield was that he reunited with Coen, who helped save Mayfield’s career with the Rams two years ago.|2024-12-19 17:19:00|381|40|8|Liam Coen|Coen respects Mayfield|3|Mixed sentiment with some optimism but also concerns about coaching decisions and player performance.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""GoneGator"", ""post"": ""I think Baker and Liam both know Baker hasn\u2019t reached his ceiling yet, consistently.

The bad: rookie nickel cornerback Tykee Smith remains limited in practice with his lingering knee issue. Smith didn’t look to be his usual attacking self Sunday against the Chargers. Tight end Cade Otton remains out of practice with a knee injury. Also limited was receiver Sterling Shepard with a foot injury. Joe never wants to see “foot” next to a receiver’s name, especially a go-to guy with 30-plus catches this season. Out sick was punt returner/forgotten receiver Trey Palmer. The good: Baker Mayfield’s new knee issue seems to be nothing. He was a full participant in practice. Sack machine defensive lineman Logan Hall was full-go with shoulder and wrist issues.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/pete-prisco-bucs-a-super-bowl-contender/|Pete Prisco: Bucs A Super Bowl Contender|More are more analysts are ringing the Bucs’ bell atop the NFL hype meter. Notriously grumpy Prickly Pete Prisco of CBS Sports is even auditioning for head Bucs cheerleader.  Joe like Prisco, but he is well known for being prickly. Joe was once at an NFL event and eavesdropped on a conversation with Prisco and an A-list guy in NFL media. The chat ended cordially with Prisco’s comrade telling him, “Stay angry, Pete.” However, Prisco has long been an admirer of the 2024 Bucs. He picked Tampa Bay to win the NFC South and had them at No. 13 in his preseason power rankings. Now, Prisco has bumped the Bucs up to a No. 12 power ranking and thinks they are a true Super Bowl contender. “All-in and they might make a run in the postseason to get to the championship and maybe even beyond. I love this team,” Prisco said. “To make the Super Bowl? Prisco’s CBS Sports colleague asked with a tone of disbelief. “I absolutely think they can,” Prisco replied. Then Prisco went on feisty rant about Calijah Kancey, Vita Vea and Lavonte David, and professed his love for the diverse makeup of the Bucs roster. Even more fun? Retired Pro Bowl guard Kyle Long was on the CBS Sports HQ panel with Prisco and agreed with him, emphasizing Baker Mayfield’s ability to win anywhere in the playoffs.|2024-12-19 14:14:00|231|39|9|Pete Prisco|Prisco praises Bucs as Super Bowl contender.|3|Mixed feelings and caution expressed, with some optimism and skepticism towards team performance.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Bucsfan81"", ""post"": ""As much as I love the Bucs I am not getting to high with this trend.

Bucs fans are riding high. The vibe is sweet. Winning and a belief more is to come rules the day. It’s like that first breath of fresh air when you step out of an over-scented Uber ride. Even Father Dungy, aka Buccaneers Ring of Honor member Tony Dungy, feels it. A Tampa local, Dungy also is an analyst for NBC Sports. “There’s a lot of confidence in the city right now,” Dungy told a Football Night In America online show. Dungy, who admitted to being “surprised” by the Bucs’ blowout of the Chargers, even thinks the Bucs can make a run. Not only are the Bucs playing very well, Dungy believes, they have a victorious track record against NFC beasts Philadelphia and Detroit before their midseason lull. So the Bucs have history that says they can beat anyone. It’s a great time to be a Bucs fan.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/theres-just-no-time-in-the-day/|“There’s Just No Time In The Day”|The red-hot playcaller of the Bucs reacted today to a question about what it’s like to be a constantly kicked around name for eventual head coach openings next month. Liam Coen is the architect of the Bucs’ top-5 offense. And don’t think it’s just because he’s from the Sean McVay tree. So is the Falcons’ new playcaller, Zach Robinson, and Joe will bring word from a respected former quarterback later today who thinks Robinson has been horrible at his job this season. Joe’s pal Rock Riley asked Coen to share the challenge of being a projected head coach candidate while still working a grueling gig trying to get the Bucs to the playoffs. Rock Riley: How hard is it for you where your name now continually comes up as the hot offensive coordinator for these head coaching jobs. You know, how hard is that, man, to concentrate on this? Bucs offensive coordinator Liam Coen: Not extremely difficult at the moment. I’ll be honest. There’s literally one goal and that’s the only one. I really hate to sound PC (politically correct) but that’s the truth. I mean, there’s just no time in the day. I got a kid sick throwing up at home last night. I mean there’s just no time to even truly think about these things. I mean, obviously, is that a goal? Is that a dream? Yeah, but that’s not at all what’s on my mind right now. The one thing is, ‘how are we going to try to go score points and stop Micah Parsons in this game on Sunday Night Football?’ That’s truly where the focus is, where it has to be. You really don’t have enough time to think otherwise right now. Joe gets what Coen is saying, but Joe also finds it hard to believe Coen isn’t talking to his agent and investing a little time studying career angles and making a list of potential staff members. Joe remembers when Dirk Koetter was the Bucs’ playcaller in 2015. Heck, Koetter’s agent was calling Joe in search of angles to help Koetter get a head coaching gig out of town. Seriously! As Joe has written, hopefully a knock on Coen’s door comes soon from Team Glazer — with a brown envolope and a firm message. And Joe also hopes Coen’s kid feels better.|2024-12-19 13:27:00|388|35|2|Liam Coen|Career-focused but limited time; balancing coaching and personal life.|3|Mixed sentiments on Liam Coen's potential departure from the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""A Bucs Fan"", ""post"": ""Don\u2019t leave Coach.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/savvy-play-design-by-liam-coen/|Savvy Play Design By Liam Coen|This is a really cool breakdown of how smart Bucs offensive coordinator Liam Coen is in finding crafty ways to get receivers open. Evan Closky of WTSP-TV Channel 10 does a video breakdown of the ways Coen schemes wide receivers to get into pockets of non-coverage. In this video, the key recipient of Coen’s play design is rookie receiver Jalen McMillan. Coen found a way to get McMillan to take advantage of open space both against man defense and zone in Los Angeles last weekend, as Closky details. This really goes to show how much Coen uses motion before the snap and how that motion opens spots on the field for receivers. The key element to these plays that Closky doesn’t mention? The Bucs’ pass blocking allows Baker Mayfield to have time to allow for the play to develop. Just good, solid teamwork all around here, from Coen’s design to the big uglies giving the play time to unfold the way Coen envisioned it.|2024-12-19 10:27:00|164|26|8|Liam Coen|Coen's savvy design gets receivers open with clever schemes.|4|Mixed sentiment with cautious optimism and concerns about past performances.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Jethro Tull"", ""post"": ""Weren\u2019t we told by Leftwich that motion was just fantasy football, not real?

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/todd-bowles-addresses-potential-liam-coen-departure/|Todd Bowles Addresses Potential Liam Coen Departure|The playcaller behind transforming the Bucs offense into a bludgeoning force — through the air and on the ground — seems destined to be a hot head coach candidate next month. That’s Liam Coen, and Bucs head coach Todd Bowles might be his biggest cheerleader. (Shutup, Todd!) Joe gets it. No coach wants to block another coach’s career path. That’s an owner’s job. Joe has lobbied for Team Glazer to find Coen’s price to not interview in the 2025 hiring cycle and remain as Bucs offensive coordinator. Put an extraordinary Christmas gift on Coen’s desk ($10 million?) and tell him it’s his if he passes on interviews. Bowles, however, isn’t thinking out of the box like that. He’s focused on winning games and understanding that Coen might be weeks away from leaving. “You know, I find solace, it’s a little early to talk about [Coen leaving], but Sean Payton told me last year once I lost [Dave] Canales, he said, ‘At least you know you’re picking the right guy.’ (laughs) That’s your only consolation in it,” Bowles told SiriusXM NFL Radio. “Having Liam come in and doing what he does, he deserves all the credit he gets. And I think he’s an outstanding person and an outstanding coach. We’ll see if he gets his shot; hopefully he does. And I’ll be happy for him. Then we’ll just have to go back to the drawing board and try to find something else, if that even comes about. But we’re trying to get in the playoffs right now, so that’s probably the furthest thing from my mind.” Again, Joe hopes Team Glazer goes to the drawing board now — not Bowles in six weeks — and concocts a plan to keep Coen in his role. Coen must have a price to spend another year in Tampa.

There have also been cracks in his armor which each week I notice goes unaddressed by you guys. For instance, there were two games, one being Atlanta we could have kept the lead and won if we were able to grind out 1 to 2 first downs. This OC handed the ball off to White. If he was as good as many of you claim, those plays would have gone to Tucker. The Bucs stole Tucker due to medical reasons, however they game against the Saints was his audition to the league. The long run Buvky made this pass week Tucker has the speed to take that to the house. Tucker is one of the top 5 running back in the league and this OC keeps him on the bench. Trey Palmer is the second fastest receiver in the league and this OC does nothing but criticize him publicly. I have seen poor throws to him but not the drops they claim. At LSU he played behind Chase and Jefferson. Any of you realize he was the speedster that cleared out for those two guys but this OC can\u2019t figure out how to use him. Additionally, he freaks out when Mayfield throws an interception then goes to all running plays. By now he should realize Mayfield throws interceptions from the pocket because he can\u2019t see. If the OC would roll him more, it would allow him to see better and fewer balls will be batted down. Third, he scripts the first two drives of the game really well. Then he keeps changing instead of continuing to do what worked and force the defense of the other team to change. These are only a few cracks that many of you overlook. In contrast, you never mention the over $40 million dollars to Tom Brady that Todd Bowles has been forced to work around for two seasons. Next year they will have the money and draft picks to get two veteran free agents inside linebacker, additionally, use the first and third round pick to get two more ILBs. Use the second round to get a cover corner. Then they can use picks 4 through 7 to get young depth for both defensive and offensive lines. Lastly, they need to use some of the money to go and get a superstar edge rusher. If we gave Bowles who is paid $3 million dollars, these tools, we should wonder how good this team could become?

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/2022-offensive-draft-class-shining/|2022 Offensive Draft Class Shining|Back in 2022, the Bucs drafted three offensive players they hoped would be in full stride by 2024. Who knew Tampa Bay would be on its third offensive coordinator in as many years? Luke Goedeke, Cade Otton and Rachaad White each started for the Bucs as rookies in 2022. Only Otton showed significant promise. Goedeke struggled terribly at left guard. White demonstrated he was decent catching out of the backfield but was no threat as a runner. Otton? He flashed, even catching a game-winning pass in the final seconds from Tom Brady to beat the Rams. Now? Well, in their third season on their third coordinator, all three are having career years. Goedeke might make the Pro Bowl. Otton easily is a top-10 tight end. And White is now a key cog in one of the league’s best run games. He’s even rushed well for three straight games! Yesterday, Bucs coach Todd Bowles was asked about how those three have been survivors and are thriving. “Those guys are doing a very good job adapting,” Bowles said. “Three coordinators in three years is a lot for anybody but those guys are good football players and they’re smart football players. “The coaches we bring in, we try to bring in teachers and intelligent coaches that work non-stop. We understand that injuries are going to happen but that shouldn’t stop us from trying to do what we have to do to win the ballgame because there are no excuses in this league. “We work diligently and hard but they’re very intelligent ball players and it makes it easier to coach them.” It would have been understandable if one of the three would have struggled so much through three transitions that the guy was traded or cut. Instead, White, Goedeke and Otton beat the odds. There is also a fourth member of that same 2022 draft class who, while not a starter, is playing a key role. That’s tight end Ko Kieft. And Kieft, too, you could argue, is having his best season. He is not a target in the passing game. However, Kieft has found his niche as a crushing blocker in the run game. All of these guys, Joe believes, have benefitted from current Bucs offensive coordinator Liam Coen.|2024-12-19 07:08:00|377|21|6|2022 Offensive Draft Class|Drafted players excel despite coaching changes|8|Mixed sentiment with a focus on player development and optimism for team improvement.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""OHBucFan"", ""post"": ""Hire teachers and draft players who want to learn and improve.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/jamel-dean-and-interception-streaks/|Jamel Dean And Interception Streaks|Jamel Dean doesn’t get a whole bunch of interceptions. But when he does get one, one could argue it is unexpected, and not because the Bucs’ cornerback has his droughts. Back in 2020, Oct. 18 to be exact, Dean had a pick-six of then-Packers drama queen quarterback Aaron Rodgers. It was Rodgers’ first pick of the season. Fast forward four years and on Sunday, Dean made a leaping interception of Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert. It was Herbert’s first pick since Week 3 this season. So when quarterbacks are on a streak of no interceptions, they better hope they don’t face Dean. Yesterday, Dean was joking and telling stories about Todd Bowles’ sarcasm. Dean didn’t mention how after a practice this summer Bowles was asked about a Dean interception and said he would need to have Dean drug-tested. Dean was asked what Bowles said about his key play in Los Angeles. “It felt great knowing that I didn’t have to worry about [officials] going to the replay to see if I grabbed it or not,” Dean joked. “I caught it clean. “I know [Bowles] was happy for me.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/todd-bowles-explains-his-postgame-scream/|Todd Bowles Explains His Postgame Scream|Todd Bowles is a stoic dude and a coach who’s hard to find celebrating publicly after a win. However, occasionally Bowles lets out an emphatic victory scream in the Bucs’ locker room in front of the NFL Films/team-media cameras. It’s a simple, “Yeahhhh!!” with an unpredictable accompanying body movement. Ok. Whatever. But why only some wins get a scream and others get nothing, barely even a smile? The whole truth is unclear, but Bowles did explain why he let his signature scream rip Sunday after Tampa Bay’s shaming of the Chargers. “It was against a very good team. It was a complete team performance,” Bowles began. “All three games contributed and we finished the game. I was most happy about the offense running the ball finishing the game, the defense getting a turnover at the end of the ballgame and doing a great job before the end of the half not letting them get in field-goal range. It was one of the few times we finished a game completely on the both sides of the ball. So I was happy about that.” Hey, shutting out a good team 27-0 on the road should get any coach screaming in ecstasy. Joe is just glad fans got to see that side of Bowles (video below). It makes being a Bucs fan more fun. And that’s the whole point, right? |2024-12-19 06:29:00|227|26|7|Todd Bowles|Bowles explains why he screamed after big win.|5|Mixed sentiment toward Todd Bowles and Devin White, with some supporting and others criticizing.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""PSL Bob"", ""post"": ""I like David stepping in with his message, as well!"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""19th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""8:05"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Bucs And Them"", ""post"": ""This with my morning cup of \u2018Joe\u2019 has me grinning ear to ear!

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/stud-dl-in-sunset-of-his-career-may-be-available/|Stud DL In Sunset Of His Career May Be Available|No, Joe doesn’t smoke. Joe enjoys breathing. But Joe does have a vice that if it isn’t solved in the next couple of years, it will be the end of Joe as if he had a two-pack-a-day habit. That vice is pleading with the Bucs to get a quality edge rusher. Kacy Rodgers, Todd Bowles’ right-hand man for many years, confessed recently the Bucs really don’t care about an edge rush. Joe couldn’t disagree more. There is no more important position on a defense. That’s why Joe is so passionate and persistent about this subject. A defense with no edge rush is like an offense without a quarterback. That means a team is handicapped from going the distance in the playoffs. And for those who scoff at this, consider Bucs history. The Bucs had a superior edge rusher (if not two) in the three greatest eras of Bucs history, which saw the team get to an NFC title game in 1979, win Super Bowl XXXVII in January 2003, and then nearly two decades later win Super Bowl LV in February 2021. Joe doesn’t believe in coincidences when it comes to football. So why is Joe torturing his soul typing about this subject again when the memory of the greatest Bucs win of the 2024 season is fresh? Because a borderline Hall of Fame defensive lineman who played defensive end for Bowles once upon a time may be available. For years, Joe has had a thing for defensive stud Calais Campbell. Many times when Campbell has been available, the Bucs had no edge rush, like the current Bucs don’t. For reasons not quite clear, the Bucs have always passed on Campbell, 38. But the guy is as durable as they come (he’s missed just nine games this decade). Since Bucs AC/DC-loving general manager Jason Licht and Bowles were both in Arizona when Campbell was there, Joe guesses the two are spooked about something that is not publicly known. Joe vividly remembers when former Super Bowl-winning coach Bucco Bruce Arians was here, Joe once asked Arians about his former stud defensive lineman. Arians sort of bristled at Joe’s mere mention, as if Joe offered Arians a glass of low-shelf swill whiskey. Take that for whatever it’s worth. Campbell has almost always produced. Last year he had 6.5 sacks, which would have been second on the Bucs. Per Barry Jackson of the Miami Herald, as soon as the Dolphins are mathematically eliminated from the playoffs, the Dolphins seem intent on fulfilling their promise to Campbell that they would release him to allow him a chance to sign with a contender. While making clear that his focus is entirely on Sunday’s game, Campbell disclosed recently that before the trade deadline, he and general manager Chris Grier discussed a scenario in which he could possibly join a playoff contender if the Dolphins are eliminated from postseason contention. With three games to go, the Bucs lead the NFC South and besides the Vikings and Eagles, they’re the hottest team in the league. Sack totals for Bucs outside linebackers are unacceptable. Nobody with a straight face could say they’re fine. Now Joe isn’t saying Campbell has Maxx Crosby numbers, but they are no worse than any Bucs outside linebackers. Hey, if you plan to play in the playoffs, aren’t you also trying to reach the Super Bowl? So why wouldn’t a smart, durable veteran help the Bucs if for no other reason than to give the team competent depth at a critical position? Again, Joe is convinced he and the Bucs just do not see an edge rush through the same prism. Hey, if Joe croaks next year from being stressed out daily over the lack of an edge rush with the Bucs, don’t be shocked if carved on Joe’s tombstone is the epithet, “Have the Bucs found an edge rusher yet?” Does Joe think the Bucs could be players for Campbell’s services when the Dolphins are fully out of the playoff picture? Of course not. |2024-12-19 03:45:00|669|32|3|Stud DL|Urgent plea for edge rusher in Bucs' defense.|5|Mixed opinions on signing Campbell due to age, fit in defense, and skepticism about impact.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Mike C"", ""post"": ""Feeling Dramatic this morning aye Joe lol"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""19th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""3:49"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Teflon Don"", ""post"": ""Saw this yesterday and immediately thought of him going to the Lions"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""19th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""3:51"", ""am""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""Jeffrey Becker"", ""post"": ""huge neck"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""19th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""5:26"", ""am""]}, ""commenter3"": {""username"": ""Joe in Michigan"", ""post"": ""Yes, please."", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""19th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""5:48"", ""am""]}, ""commenter4"": {""username"": ""Joe in Michigan"", ""post"": ""Twice the sacks as JTS at 38 years old, oof."", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""19th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""5:50"", ""am""]}, ""commenter5"": {""username"": ""A Bucs Fan"", ""post"": ""He\u2019ll either go to the Lions or Ravens."", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""19th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""6:00"", ""am""]}, ""commenter6"": {""username"": ""Zoocomics"", ""post"": ""Calias has always reminded me of Suh, I felt like that was part of the reason we didn\u2019t go after him earlier in the Arians regime when he was a free agent several years ago, is because we already had Suh.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/kay-adams-bucs-are-a-complete-af-team/|Kay Adams: Bucs Are “A Complete AF Team.”|Hey, Joe can’t sit here and wag a finger at Kay Adams. Joe’s reaction watching the Bucs’ seal-clubbing of the Chargers in person was pretty much the same. Joe sure didn’t see that coming, a 40-17 physical blowout. And if anyone claims they did foresee such a slaughter, Joe wants to see a copy of their sportsbook ticket documenting such a prediction. Adams, the former NFL Network it-girl who now hosts her own weekday show on FanDuelTV, “Up and Adams,” said as a result of the Bucs kicking the snot out of the Chargers, that way too many people have been sleeping on Tampa Bay. And, Adams pointed out, that must end. “We egregiously, sadly, in disappointing fashion, keep overlooking the Bucs,” Adams began. “What they did to the Chargers Sunday, c’mon. “Tampa got no love for — and I’m going to call it — the most complete performance of the year by any team. They go into L.A. and go against the No. 1 scoring ‘D,’ OK? And they ripped them apart.” As a result, Adams seems to think the Bucs are damn dangerous team. “Let me put this into perspective for you,” Adams said. “The Chargers allowed just 20 points three times. The No. 1 scoring defense, great defense. The Bucs dropped 27 in the second half alone. “They dropped 40 — they dropped 40 on them!” “[The Chargers] gave up 400 yards once all year, just once. Tampa says, ‘Uh, OK, we will just casually put up over 500 yards.” So what is the difference between the Bucs now and the Bucs when they were mired in a four-game losing streak leading to the bye? Adams thinks it is as simple as not having a healthy Mike Evans. “The Bucs are 8-3 with Mike Evans,” Adams said. “You want to know what they are without him? Oh-fer. 0-for-3.” After watching the Bucs manhandle the Chargers, Adams came to this conclusion: The Bucs, Adams added, are “a complete AF team.” Seems to be a catchy phrase, no? “They are catching fire at the right time,” Adams said. “Stop sleeping on them!” You know what the alley-beating of the Chargers reminds Joe of? Almost exactly a year to the date, the Bucs also went on the road but this time it was to dreary, gray, cold and rainy Green Bay instead of sunny Los Angeles. There, the Bucs pounded the Packers, opened up the offense and it wasn’t long before the Packers cried for mercy. The Bucs went on to win the NFC South and came within a cat’s whisker of the NFC title game. Could the final month of the season mirror last year’s?|2024-12-19 00:00:00|446|31|8|Kay Adams|Bucs impress with dominant performance|7|Mixed sentiment with some optimism and confidence, but also skepticism and criticism.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Bucswin!"", ""post"": ""BUCS vs bills Superbowl.
