No doubt about it,” Bowles said today. “If we stop making the mistakes that we’re making, we’re in every game at the end, we gotta turn it around and turn the losses into wins.”Joe can’t argue much with Bowles here. The Bucs are 4-6 but easily could have two more wins under their belts. They’ve lost two games in overtime and then there was yesterday’s blown fourth-quarter lead and blown shot to put the game away late.The Bucs may not need new players, but they sure need old players. The majority of wide receiver snaps yesterday went to Ryan Miller and Rakim Jarrett. That’s quite a giant step down from Mike Evans and Chris Godwin.Hopefully, Evans returns in New Jersey against the Giants on Nov. 24, following this week’s bye.In the meantime, Bowles will take his coaches and players back to the lab to get the defense right, and more.", "post_time": "2024-11-11T20:13:43+00:00", "word_count": 183, "number_of_comments": 99, "article_sentiment_score": "4", "article_subject": "Todd Bowles", "article_summary": "Bowles confident in existing talent despite team's challenges", "responses": {"commenter0": {"username": "Durango 95", "post": "Bowles is likely right.

Its defense almost tried to let the Bucs score late.And still the Bucs found a way to lose.NFL humorist Mike Tanier, a friend of JoeBucsFan.com, typing on his Substack page “Too Deep Zone,” noted the Bucs have lost all their stars on offense and still the 49ers couldn’t fully stop the Bucs.The 49ers endured another droopy afternoon against a beatable NFC also-ran on Sunday: in this case, an opponent in a three-game tailspin, missing its Hall of Fame WR1 (Mike Evans), his perennial 1,000-yard rhythm guitarist (Chris Godwin) and, by the second quarter, its Pro Bowl left tackle (Tristan Wirfs suffered an MCL sprain).What should have been a McCaffrey coronation jubilee became a nailbiter. The 49ers did all the dumb stuff that cost them games this year. They settled for six field goal attempts. They missed three of them. They were unable to stop a team with zero wide receivers from running the ball. The 49ers defense allowed the Buccaneers to tie the game on an epic penalty spree which screamed we have officially run out of all of our composure for the year.Tanier is right. The 49ers were comically bad in the second half. With all of their missed field goals and horrible defensive penalties — if the Bucs did that on defense Bucs fans rightfully would have lit torches last night — it was if the 49ers took the Bucs on the moneyline.(There was also fun on the 49ers bench when Deebo Samuel got into a hassle with 49ers long snapper Taybor Pepper before whacking Moody in the not-so-friendly fire. It almost looked like Moe belting Larry and Curly in a Three Stooges skit.)So yeah the Bucs should have been rolled yesterday.

All 11 guys out there have to play better,” said an agitated Lavonte David in the postgame locker room yesterday.David seems confident the Bucs defense has stopped tapping into its nasty side.” … We played our tails off – never take that away from us, we’ll always play hard. We’ve got that part down, but we just have to execute better, play smart football, and play nasty football, play smart, aggressive football. Make plays,” David said.“We’re not making enough plays – everybody, myself included – we’re not making enough plays. That’s all it comes down to.”How does losing on defense feel, Lavonte?“It feels shi*ty. It’s always in our hands,” David said. “As a defensive captain of this football team, I’m out there, I’m not doing enough.  Everybody is not doing enough, so whatever it is, we have to dig deep and find it. Whatever it is, we have to fix it ASAP.”There’s no great savior coming for the Bucs defense, though playmaker nickel cornerback Tykee Smith should be back after the current bye week and Jamel Dean should be right behind him.

The other Joe is highly dubious that a team with a defense that almost weekly folds in the final minute can overcome a weaksauce schedule.)A team could rally, bond and go on a winning bender or a team can fracture into 45 pieces and dudes could make business decisions or look out for their own stats and their next contract.Bucs defensive tackle Calijah Kancey declared there would be no fracturing of the Bucs locker room as the team heads off to enjoy their bye week.“We’re all brothers,” Kancey said from the Bucs’ locker room after a demoralizing 23-20 loss to the 49ers. “We all trust each other in here – nothing will bring us apart.“We all believe in each other. We have to go out there and play together. We put in the work together so, nothing will break us up.”That’s easy to say, but is it practical?Look, Joe isn’t being outrageous here or flippant. Let’s address the elephant in the room.The Bucs were expected to contend for a possible NFC title game appearance. Now they are 4-6 and this team sure looks a lot more like a team that will circle the drain in the final seven games than a team that will run the table and maybe outpace the Dixie Chicks.And the biggest reason why is the defense, specifically in fourth quarters. The Bucs have now lost half their games on a game’s final drive. That’s not an accident; that’s a trend.On top of that, despite the Bucs drafting all kinds of players to rush the quarterback from the edge, the Bucs still struggle to breathe on quarterbacks with an edge rusher.And week in and week out, there are dudes comically wide open over the middle. Yet nothing appears to be changing. Or adjusting. It’s the same ol’ same ol.’All of this under the gaze of a head coach who made his bones on the defensive side of the ball.

Wirfs went down in the first half yesterday. For two games, the Bucs and offensive coordinator Liam Coen did a really nice job of wading through the muck of not having a starting receiver.That all caught up with them yesterday. When Wirfs went down, to make sure Nick Bosa didn’t go nuts, the Bucs were forced to throw two-yard passes. Maybe. In short, the Bucs offense was neutered.How so? Of the 29 pass attempts Mayfield had, only four were completed to wide receivers. It’s kind of hard to play offense with a hand tied behind your back.But it wasn’t just offense. On defense, the Bucs were without three starters in the secondary. When Zyon McCullom went down with a hamstring, he joined Jamel Dean and Tykee Smith on the sidelines.However, Joe thinks the 49ers scored on the final drive more because teams have figured out the Bucs defense, but clearly it did not help playing so many backups.It was only a matter of time before all those injuries caught up with the team.Sunday was that day.Why Not Use Bucky Irving?A few weeks ago when Sean Tucker had a breakout game against the slimy Saints, the Bucs said they would devote a series to each of their three running backs and then ride the hot hand.Who had a hotter hand at running back yesterday than Bucky Irving? So who got touches on the Bucs’ final drive where a touchdown may have won the game? It wasn’t Bucky Irving.No, it was Rachaad White.Now Joe sort of gets it. With Wirfs out, the Bucs needed help blocking. White, the Bucs believe, is a better blocker than Irving. And he is a better pass catcher.So Joe gets why White was on the field. However, the Bucs didn’t use him right. On first-and-goal, the Bucs had White run twice between the tackles. That’s not his forte. At all.If White was your preferred option, why not run him outside? Or throw him the ball outside. He’s got the moves outside the hashmarks to make guys miss.And if you were going to run, you sure as hell didn’t need White (or Irving) to block. So why not have your best running back on the field, Irving?Poor use of personnel there.Liam Coen Finally Had A Less Than Ideal GameJoe has been a big proponent of offensive coordinator Liam Coen. He’s done a wonderful job, especially in light of all the injuries. He’s found ways to highlight guys’ skills, like Cade Otton.But Coen finally had a less-than-ideal game yesterday. Yes, he had his hands tied somewhat with Wirfs’ injury. Still, what was that in the Bucs’ final drive?White for two runs and then a failed pass to Rakim Jarrett? Really? Those were the best options on your playsheet?If the Bucs were going to run the ball, Coen absolutely should have had Irving out there and not White. Huge miscalculation.Coen has been the bright spot for the Bucs each week, it seems. He’s now proven to be human.Defense Needs Help But Offense Doesn’t Have The JuiceJoe doesn’t think there is any question Bucs coach Todd Bowles trusts his defense way, way too much.This isn’t his defense of 2020 or even 2021. This is a bad defense. And a depleted defense. Bowles has now been burned three times in the past six games and twice in the past week by banking on his defense to get one last stop.The defense barfed on itself each time.One way to help the defense is to score, preferably more points, preferably first (yesterday, the Bucs fell to 0-5 this season when opponents score first).But as Joe pointed out, now the Bucs are down a Pro Bowl receiver, an All-Pro tackle (maybe) and a future Hall of Fame receiver.The Bucs couldn’t score enough points to make up for the defense. And that’s a bad, bad combination.We saw a whole lot of that during The Lost Decade.No wonder the Bucs are 4-6 bad.Baker Mayfield’s Stiff-ArmThere aren’t a lot of good things Joe can take away from yesterday’s game. But Baker Mayfield demonstrated (again) why his teammates really like him and why he has the respect of opponents.Mayfield has dawg in him. And Mayfield had such a dawg move yesterday, it nearly had Tom Brady jump out of his seat.Remember how Mayfield stiff-armed Nick Bosa and kept Bosa at arm’s length on fourth down just long enough to float a pass through traffic that Rachaad White hauled in (excellent catch) for a first down on the Bucs’ final drive?That was a helluva play. That was Mayfield in a nutshell. Heart, determination, grit, fight, feistiness. Yeah, and moxie.Brady hollered from his FOX TV booth how that play by Mayfield was the best play from a quarterback he has ever seen.That’s a mouthful.Real recognizes real.The Bucs offense is in decent hands so long as Mayfield can stay upright.\n", "post_time": "2024-11-11T10:00:05+00:00", "word_count": 882, "number_of_comments": 37, "article_sentiment_score": "0", "article_subject": "Five Things", "article_summary": "Bucs struggle with injuries in disappointing game.", "responses": {"commenter0": {"username": "ukester", "post": "white was gassed-where was tucker-", "post_time": "November 11th, 2024 at 5:09 am"}, "commenter1": {"username": "Jw94buc", "post": "Get ready for the giants in two weeks.

He has the same 4 to 7  calls on defense no matter the offense they play. Just to be fair he defense is missing quite a few starters. They starters they are playing are playing to many minutes during the first 3 quarters. Hence the reason they can not stop anymore in the 4th quarter or overtime.
