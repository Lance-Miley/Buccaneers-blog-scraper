https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/winning-with-jason-licht-part-v-trade-patience/|Winning With Jason Licht (Part V): Trade Patience|The Bucs sit in rare territory as a team that’s won four consecutive division titles after winning a Super Bowl. The architect of this sustained success is Buccaneers Ring of Honor general manager Jason Licht, so Joe has talked to many people not named “Licht” about how the boss has executed during this historic stretch. (Parts 1-4 of this series below and yeah, many more parts are on the way): Joe sat down last year with Buccaneers assistant general manager Mike Greenberg for insight into moves under Licht. One nugget that struck Joe was the trade for Rob Gronkowski after the Bucs signed Tom Brady. That sure seemed simple on the surface. Brady wants Gronk; Gronk was unretiring and it was easy to assume he wanted to play with Brady only. And the Patriots had little incentive to keep Gronk if he wanted to move on. Well, not so simple, Greenberg explained. Greenberg lauded Licht for his patience on that trade. The Bucs dealt a 2020 fourth-round pick for Gronk right before the 2020 NFL Draft, but a potential trade was in motion weeks prior, Greenberg said, and Licht would not pull the trigger. Licht didn’t like the price tag and wanted to play it cool. The requested compensation for Gronk was much greater than a fourth-rounder, per Greenberg, and the Bucs would have valued Gronk up to a second-round pick. He was still 30 years old and his talent level could have justified premium draft capital. Still, weeks went by and Licht didn’t flinch. “The price for Gronk was a lot higher,” Greenberg said. “Jason waited it out and was patient, the draft was really the deadline and we got it done like the day before the draft. … Jason let it play out and develop and I’ll give Jason a lot of credit on the patience.” Imagine if Licht was too hungry to land Gronk and satisfy Tom Brady? Say the Bucs dealt their 2020 second-round pick for Gronk and got back two fourth-round picks from New England along with the Hall of Fame tight end. Not a terrible deal on paper. But that second-rounder (No. 45 overall) became All-Pro Bucs safety Antoine Winfield Jr., a huge rookie contributor to the 2020 Super Bowl team. Do the Bucs win the Super Bowl without Winfield’s critical forced fumble in the playoffs against the Saints, trailing by a touchdown in the third quarter? In a future edition, Joe’s got an example of Licht being impatient on draft day and it paying off.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/alex-cappa-deal-could-foreshadow-ben-bredeson-contract/|Alex Cappa Deal Could Foreshadow Ben Bredeson Contract|Intriguing news this afternoon on a few fronts.  Tom Brady underboss John Spytek, the Raiders general manager and former Bucs assistant GM, seems to be chasing familiar talent. Per ProFootballTalk.com, the Raiders have agreed to a deal in principle with recently-released Bengals guard Alex Cappa. The former Buccaneer (2018-2021) was courted by Brady to stay in Tampa but shunned The Goat. Now, he’ll ink a two-year, $11 million deal when free agency opens next week, per PFT. Cappa, 30, is very good, not great, and one could put Bucs pending free agent left guard Ben Bredeson in that boat, though he only turned 27 last month. Might Buccaneers Ring of Honor general manager Jason Licht be dangling two-years, $15 million in front of Bredeson with, say, $10 million guaranteed? That would be a solid price that Joe would consider team-friendly, especially considering Bredeson can play center if needed like he did with the Giants.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/old-man-khalil-mack-has-young-man-metrics/|Old Man Khalil Mack Has Young-Man Metrics|So unlike Joe and the legions of Bucs fans who feast on the Spring Break menu at their local Hooters each day, ESPN analysts have access to NFL NextGen Stats data.  That’s the raw info culled from sensors in players’ equipment on game days, not the stuff interpreted by college interns for pay-per-view stat sites. That’s why Joe paid attention today to ESPN’s Dan Pizzuta on The Mina Kimes Show. He traffics in analytics and was there to talk free agency. It didn’t take long for Joe to put down the Buffalo shrimp and weep in ecstasy at the prospect of the Bucs’ signing 34 year old free agent edge rusher Khalil Mack. Pizzuta shared that NextGen data shows Mack is quicker off the ball than pending Eagles free agent edge rusher Josh Sweat and Joe Tryon-Shoyinka. Pizzuta said he absolutely would choose Mack over Sweat if he was buying an edge rusher for 2025. “His get-off rate from NextGen Stats was still the best of this edge rush class in free agency,” Pizzuta said of Mack. Mack also has an abnormally high percentage of QB hits that become sacks, per Pizzuta. In other words, he finishes. Interestingly, Pizzuta noted Mack plays the run extremely well and is not “cheating on pass rush snaps,” meaning he’s disciplined and isn’t cranking out his best pass rush get-off on what appears like a run play. Todd Bowles loves big strong guys like Mack (6-3, 270) who play the run. Man, Joe can almost visualize Mack’s No. 52 in a Bucs-red jersey getting home on pass rush games with Calijah Kancey. The free agency siren goes off in five short days. Five!|2025-03-05 13:42:00|279|26|6|Khalil Mack|Old Man Mack impresses with NextGen Stats data.|5|Mix of optimism and pessimism.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/cycle-talks-returns-we-know-what-we-have-with-todd/|“Cycle” Talk Returns; “We Know What We Have With Todd”|Man, Buccaneers Ring of Honor general manager Jason Licht doesn’t play soft zone defense when defending Todd Bowles. Bucs fans heard that when Licht stepped into the Ira Kaufman Podcast last week. On Radio Row at the NFL Scouting Combine, Joe asked Licht about fans being hard on Bowles’ coaching performance over the past three years. Licht emphasized that Bowles has done a strong job getting the most out of his roster and navigating through injuries and tough times. “We need to get some more players and depth in certain spots. It’s just the cycle we’re in that we had to focus last year on offense. You know, not everything is, ‘You can put it on the [head] coach,'” Licht said. “And, I mean, you guys [at JoeBucsFan] talk about The Lost Decade all the time. We’ve been going to the playoffs for five straight years now and Todd’s been here the whole time. But he’s been the head coach for three of those years. … I mean, I guess there’s expectation to win the Super Bowl every year, but I think Todd’s been doing a great job steadying the ship and pulling us out of some ruts [in 2022 and 2023] and keeping the faith and keeping guys positive, and we’ve done some great things … “You never know what you’re going to get with a head coach and we know what we have with Todd. And we’re going to do whatever we can to help improve the team for him.” This reminded Joe of Licht telling John Romano of TampaBay.com, the internet arm of the twice-weekly community newspaper serving part of the Bay area, that Bowles did a “remarkable” job last regular season. In that interview, Licht also mentioned the “cycle” of reloading the roster post-Tom Brady and that defense is behind offense in that process. Yes, it’s obvious the Bucs will have a defense-heavy draft next month, though that could change slightly if the NFL landscape in free agency next week shapes up in a Bucs-friendly direction.|2025-03-05 12:03:00|340|33|8|Todd Bowles|Licht praises Bowles' coaching performance and team improvements.|4|Mixed sentiments about Todd Bowles including average performance and potential for improvement.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""HC Grover"", ""post"": ""Yes we do.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/bucs-hierarchy-challenged-by-cornerback-evaluation/|Bucs Hierarchy Challenged By Cornerback Evaluation|It’s a common thought that the Bucs need a cornerback in the 2025 NFL Draft. Maybe starter Jamel Dean stays at his bloated salary. Maybe he reworks his contract or is cut. Regardless, the Bucs’ No. 3 corner (Bryce Hall) was lost last season in Week 1 and that became a weakness as Dean missed several games. The Bucs need more cornerback depth. Joe is holding out hope it comes in free agency or via trade. So Joe was very intrigued to hear Buccaneers Ring of Honor general manager Jason Licht and his former assistant GM John Spytek, the new Raiders underboss to Tom Brady, answer the same scouting question the same way in two different interviews. Each was asked at the NFL Scouting Combine last week on PFT Live to name their most difficult position to evaluate. And both Licht and Spytek said it’s cornerback. PFT Live crew member Chris Simms, the former Bucs quarterback, noted among other executives “safeties” is a popular answer to that question, along with linebacker. Spytek replied that safeties usually show up on film quickly and consistently but cornerbacks are a different animal because the good ones don’t always get much action. Licht had the same answer and noted scouting them can challenge patience and an evaluator has to look deeper into what’s happening when the ball doesn’t come their way. Regardless, it seems scouting cornerback isn’t smooth at One Buc Palace, though Licht and his crew selected Carlton Davis, Jamel Dean and Sean Murphy-Bunting last decade, three core starts of the 2020 Super Bowl team. All this cornerback chatter reminds Joe of when legendary Bucs cornerback Rondé Barber said Vernon Hargreaves was the third-most talented cornerback in Buccaneers history.|2025-03-05 11:18:00|286|15|6|Bucs Hierarchy|Need for cornerback depth and challenges in evaluation.|3|Mixture of criticism but also recognition of past successes and potential improvements.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Gipper"", ""post"": ""Dean should be cut for all the obvious reasons.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/todd-bowles-discusses-crop-of-inside-linebackers/|Todd Bowles Discusses Crop Of Inside Linebackers|As Joe types this here post a week from the free agency dinner bell ringing, Joe has eyes on three players for the Bucs to draft at No. 19 next month. Those three would be Alabama inside linebacker Jihaad Campbell, Marshall edge rusher Mike Green and Ohio State receiver Emeka Egbuka. As fans know, what a team does in free agency is usually a tell for what they will do in the draft. If you put a gun to Joe’s head force Joe to choose, Joe would likely go with Campbell. The guy just isn’t an inside linebacker. He’s a jack of all trades. He can cover. He can rush the passer. He can play the run. He’s so versatile. Most top linebackers are outside linebackers or edge rushers. Todd Bowles was asked about the lack of top-shelf inside linebackers in the draft and he didn’t necessarily agree. In short, Bowles said talented inside linebackers are there; you just have to find one. “I think it’s the state of the position,” Bowles said. “There are good football players at linebacker coming out in the draft, they’re just not going as high. “Between the quarterbacks, the tackles, the edge rushers, the cornerbacks and the [wide] receivers, they kind of make up the bulk of really the top-10 [picks] so to speak, if you will. “There are good linebackers coming out, you’re just not getting them as high.” So does that mean that the Bucs figure they can get good value at inside linebacker on Day 2 of the draft? Knowing how Bowles likes to throw the kitchen sink at offenses and how Campbell has a loaded toolbox, he would be an awfully hard talent to pass up. Campbell could become the long-term player the Bucs hoped Devin White would be.|2025-03-05 10:30:00|299|18|7|Todd Bowles|Exploring options for inside linebackers in upcoming draft.|6|Mixed feelings towards draft picks, Campbell and White mentioned positively, uncertainties about selections.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Aqualung"", ""post"": ""Diva White was (is?) intensely immature.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/harold-landry-would-only-cost-a-third-day-draft-pick/|Harold Landry May Only Cost A Third-Day Draft Pick?|If this really is an accurate assessment, Joe cannot fathom how Bucs AC/DC-loving general manager Jason Licht couldn’t or wouldn’t pull the trigger. You can see it; Joe can see it. And Joe thinks the Bucs can see it. The Bucs have a Grand Canyon-sized hole at edge rusher. While YaYa Diaby at times flashes and looks like a stud, Joe sure would like to see more of those 15 sacks Bucs coach Todd Bowles said Diaby could have had last year. Some way, Diaby turned those 15 sacks into 4.5. Joe firmly believes the Bucs are a veteran, reliable, solid, productive edge rusher away from making a Super Bowl run. When Bucs AC/DC-loving general manager Jason Licht sat down with NFL Media podcaster Gregg Rosenthal last week at the Combine, he said he was not “blind” to the holes on the defense. OK, that’s the first step in recognizing there’s a problem. Being upfront about it. Now what? Joe maintains Tennessee edge rusher Harold Landry could be that answer. Landry, who will be 29 this summer, has had no less than nine sacks in each of the last three seasons. The Titans allowed Landry to start looking for trade partners. Why can’t this be the Bucs? Well, Ben Solak of BSPN isn’t typing that the Bucs should go out and get Landry. But Solak did research what a team would have to give up to obtain Landry. Solak thinks Landry could be had for a third-day draft pick. The Falcons sent a third-round pick to the Patriots for Matthew Judon last year. Judon was 32, only hitting the cap for $6.5 million and had recently delivered 12.5- and 15.5-sack seasons. Also, last August the Seahawks traded 27-year-old Darrell Taylor to the Bears for a sixth-round pick — Taylor wasn’t a scheme fit in Seattle and had only one year of $3.1 million left on his rookie deal. I’d imagine Landry will come in somewhere between those two compensations as long as he plays on a restructured contract for the acquiring team. A fourth-round pick in the 2025 draft seems fair, though contract machinations can dramatically affect the price. So a guy who has had 31.5 sacks in the past three seasons can be had for a fourth-round pick!? If Joe took a call from Titans GM Mike Borgonzi and he wanted a fourth-rounder for Landry, Joe would swear he’s getting punked. Joe couldn’t make the deal fast enough. It’s not like Licht hasn’t solved his edge-rushing woes before with a trade of a coveted draft pick. His greatest heist as Bucs general manager was Jason Pierre-Paul for a third-round pick. Robbery! Three seasons later, the Bucs are Super Bowl champs! So, as Licht told Rosenthal, he’s not blind. Now what? Wanting to resolve a massive hole on an otherwise strong roster and actually resolving it are two different things. It’s like Joe watching college football on a Saturday on a scorching hot September afternoon. A cold beer sure would hit the spot. But to get that beer, Joe has to get off his leather couch, walk to the kitchen and open the fridge. That beer ain’t gonna fetch itself.|2025-03-05 07:00:00|530|31|7|Harold Landry|Bucs could acquire Landry for a low draft pick.|1|Mixed reactions to potentially acquiring Landry, with skepticism and optimism expressed.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""SB~LV"", ""post"": ""MLB that can drop and cover also allows the pass rush to get to the QB that was the area of the field that every team tried to exploit!"", ""post_time"": [""March"", ""5th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""7:03"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Allbuccedup"", ""post"": ""Can\u2019t pull the trigger fast enough provided Landry will restructure!"", ""post_time"": [""March"", ""5th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""7:09"", ""am""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""Beeej"", ""post"": ""A 5th/6th and Dean"", ""post_time"": [""March"", ""5th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""7:20"", ""am""]}, ""commenter3"": {""username"": ""Redzone"", ""post"": ""They must think he\u2019ll be cut eventually so y give anything up?

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/ankle-injury-likely-cost-chris-godwin-millions/|Ankle Injury Likely Cost Chris Godwin Many Millions|Joe always hopes good guys in the NFL are rewarded. Because they are good guys. And there are few better than Chris Godwin, a true class act. So it sucked when he got injured against the Crows last year. It sucked even more because it appears that injury likely cost Godwin millions of dollars. It’s very possible Godwin will be a free agent a week from today, March 12. The vibe Joe got from Bucs AC/DC-loving general manager Jason Licht and head coach Todd Bowles was not reassuring. In a perfect world, Godwin would be locked up by next week, but that injury seems to have the Bucs spooked. They don’t want to drop a ton of Team Glazer loot on a guy who is damaged goods, no matter how much they like and respect Godwin. Joe totally understands that. Now at the combine, Joe spoke off the record with an NFL suit who said Godwin would be signed by someone for a good chunk less than what people in the Fourth Estate have estimated. Joe has seen $20 million a year or more tossed out by national NFL stenographers. Joe was told that won’t happen. It’s a combination of Godwin’s age (29) and two major injuries the past four seasons. Well, Matt Lombardo, a former Giants and Eagles beat guy, seems to back up Joe’s source. Lombardo has intel from an unnamed agent claiming Godwin won’t even sign for $15 million, forget $20 million. This is what Lombardo typed on his site, “Between the Hashmarks.” A second agent suggests Godwin could be in line for a deal in the neighborhood of DeAndre Hopkins’ two-year deal worth $26 million, and that for the Buccaneers, who have limited cap space and some emerging young receivers behind Mike Evans, that could wind up too rich even for as much as Licht appreciates and values Godwin. So, $13 million a year? That’s quite farther south than $20 million. Let’s say Godwin signs a two-year deal; that’s some $14 million that injury cost Godwin. Ouch! Another agent Lombardo spoke to predicted Godwin would sign a prove-it contract (maybe not with the Bucs) to demonstrate his ankle is fine and he can still play high-level, injury-free ball.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/yahoo-bucs-are-a-boring-free-agent-team-in-march-2025/|Yahoo!: Bucs Are A Boring Free Agent Team (In March 2025)|If something isn’t interesting, it’s then boring, right? Though Yahoo! NFL columnist Frank Schwab didn’t come out and call the Bucs boring this free agency season, it’s sort of what was implied in the headline of Schwab’s story. Schwab cobbled together a list of the most interesting teams in free agency when the dinner bell rings on March 12 after two days of legal tampering. (Illegal tampering took place last week at the Indiana Convention Center in Indianapolis and in the various bars, eateries and coffee shops where national NFL reporters weren’t already getting into hassles.) The Bucs, per Schwab, are the No. 30 most interesting (or No. 3 most boring). The Buccaneers have two franchise icons, Chris Godwin and Lavonte David, about to hit the market. Tampa Bay also doesn’t have much salary cap flexibility, so it’ll be hard to bring either back or make a big outside signing. That’s OK, because it’s a solid roster. Solid roster with maybe one giant hole, perhaps two. And those positions are why Joe’s antennae will be fully upright Monday morning when legal tampering begins. Joe believes the Bucs are one or two players away on defense to making a real Super Bowl run. It just so happens one of those holes is the most important position on defense, an edge rusher.
