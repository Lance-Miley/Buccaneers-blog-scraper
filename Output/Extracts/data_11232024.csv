Would that new coach have the second-most wins in NFL history? Some league insiders think that is a real possibility. One speed bump stands in the way: Todd Bowles is very much still employed by Tampa Bay. And if he is able to rally his troops to reach the playoffs in the remaining seven games, it would be a stretch to think Bowles would get run. However, from a few coaches and NFL suits who spoke to Dianna Russini of The Athletic, if the Bucs’ season goes south in the next two months, a long shadow will hang over One Buc Palace. That would be the silhouette of Bill Belichick. The former Browns and Patriots coach lurks. He has six rings to his resume as a head coach and is largely believed to be seeking a new team after parting ways with the Patriots in January. Russini asked coaches and NFL shot-callers where Belichick may land. While Jacksonville was often mentioned, so too (“frequently”) were the Bucs, Russini typed. One common answer was the Jacksonville Jaguars. In a recent episode of the “Scoop City” podcast, my co-host Chase Daniel and I discussed the possibility of Belichick taking over Jacksonville in 2025, should Doug Pederson get fired. While Belichick has maintained a strong relationship with Jaguars ownership, it’s anticipated he would seek changes in the front office, particularly regarding current general manager Trent Baalke. The other two teams that came up frequently: The Dallas Cowboys and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers (should those jobs open up). Of course, Belichick has been dropping hints himself in his many media responsibilities this year. Earlier this season on “Inside the NFL,” Belichick enthusiastically said of the Bucs’ offense, “I love Baker Mayfield.” And recently on the Manning Bros. show, Belichick spoke glowingly of Bucs AC/DC-loving general manager Jason Licht who worked with Belichick in New England. Belichick, on his YouTube channel, said Bucs left tackle Tristan Wirfs was the best at his position this season. So there is something for Bucs fans and Joe’s readers to chew on as they prep for the Bucs-Giants game tomorrow at 1 p.m. Ira Kaufman Demands The Floor To Clarify His Stance On Jason Licht, Talks Post-Bye Miss, Mike Evans Realities, Bucs-Giants Predictions, And More |2024-11-23 17:22:00|385|40|5|Bill Belichick|Coaching speculation involving Belichick for multiple NFL teams.|6|Mixed reactions towards the potential of Bill Belichick coaching the Bucs|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Dewey Selmon"", ""post"": ""I don\u2019t think he would want to follow Brady here.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/11/another-setback-for-simeon-rice/|Another Setback For Simeon Rice|BY IRA KAUFMAN Simeon Rice’s Hall of Fame case remains on slow boil. Since sacks became an official statistic in 1982, only 20 players have deposited quarterbacks on their rumps more often than No. 97, a terror off the right edge in Tampa Bay for six seasons. Yet Rice’s name doesn’t trigger much enthusiasm among the 49 selectors who decide who will be fitted for gold jackets in Canton. It’s an enduring mystery because Rice has been eligible for induction since 2013. In that time, only twice has he made the list of 25 semifinalists. He advanced to the top 25 in 2018 and 2020, but was eliminated both times in the cutdown to the final 15. This month, Rice once again was not among the group of 25 semifinalists, which includes edge rushers Jared Allen, Terrell Suggs and Robert Mathis. Only the 15 finalists get to hear their case heard, so Rice’s compelling resume remains buried in the shadows. If you saw Simeon Rice play, whether it was with the Cardinals or Bucs, you know he was a consistent game-wrecker. From 1998-2005, his 101.5 sacks were tops in the league. He was very good in Arizona and even better in Tampa, where he registered 69.5 sacks, 19 forced fumbles, 4 interceptions, 37 passes defended and 67 tackles for loss in only 87 games before a shoulder injury led to his release in 2007. When the games counted the most, Rice was at the top of his game. In five postseason matchups as a Buccaneer, Rice posted seven sacks and four forced fumbles. He could easily have been named MVP of Tampa Bay’s 2003 Super Bowl victory, but the league wanted the media votes in early and Dexter Jackson had already made his mark with a pair of interceptions. During his Hall of Fame speech in 2014, Derrick Brooks lauded Rice as “one of the best, if not the best pass rushers of his generation.” So what’s the holdup? Not every outstanding pass rusher sails into Canton. Allen has been waiting his turn, despite ranking 12th all-time with 136 career sacks. Leslie O’Neal finished with 132.5 sacks, the same as Lawrence Taylor, yet he never made it into the discussion room as a modern-era candidate. He’s now languishing in the senior abyss, with dozens of other outstanding candidates waiting their turn. The same fate could befall Rice, who was the second-fastest player to 100 sacks behind Reggie White. “There’s no Hall of Fame without me in it,” Rice says. “I dominated when I played. There was nobody better at my position — nobody.” That might be hyperbole, but Rice isn’t far off. He was too athletic and smart for most left tackles to handle. And with Warren Sapp aligned off Rice’s left shoulder in Tampa Bay’s 4-man front, offensive coordinators faced an immense challenge in keeping quarterbacks upright. You can’t blame Rice for being frustrated. At the age of 50, he knows his Hall of Fame chances appear to be slipping away. The Hall of Fame panel is getting younger and soon there will be voters who never saw Rice come off the right edge with fury and precision. There were many times when I saw Rice running laps around the field well after practice had ended. He kept himself in peak condition — and that’s why his shoulder injury in 2006 was so surprising. When the Bucs released him the following summer, it seemed to be a rash move, but in essence, Rice’s glorious career was over. He took a course at the New York Film Academy in 2009 and directed some projects, but he never quite got football out of his blood. In 2017, he talked about a career comeback with the Buccaneers. He was only half-joking. Rice dealt with bouts of depression after his retirement, but he seems to be in a good place. The Glazers should seriously consider Rice for the Buccaneer Ring of Honor. He was the final piece of a historic defense. If his case is ever heard by Hall of Fame voters and he’s passed over, Rice can live with that. Somehow, some way, he’s got to get into the room where it happens. Food, Fun & More For Sunday’s Bucs-Giants Game Bring canned foods to help local food banks and/or a toy for a local child.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/11/hes-back-5/|He’s Back!|Bucs fans can breathe a sigh of major relief. The season, it appears, will not be dependent on the play of backup corners Josh Hayes or this Tyrek Funderburk. Long-time Bucs starting corner Jamel Dean has been activated by the Bucs. He will start tomorrow. So either Hayes or Funderburk, mercifully, will not start. Somewhere, Tommy Cutlets weeps. And, Joe might add, Zyon McCollum has yet to be ruled out for tomorrow’s game at the New Jersey Swamplands. Dean blew out his hamstring in the blowout of the slimy Saints over a month ago. Also, backup linebacker Vi Jones has been elevated to the active roster. The saga of Jones is one of the biggest head-scratchers this season from Bucs coach Todd Bowles. The Bucs defense has been awful this year. Part of that has been the play of K.J. Britt who, because of an injury to SirVocea Dennis, has had to be a full-time linebacker. Britt is simply a lost cause in the passing game. However, Bowles said a reason Britt played full-time and the Bucs didn’t go out and get a linebacker who could defend the pass is that practice squad linebacker Jones was not ready to play — despite Jones being with the Bucs for a year! If a dude — a weekday warrior! — needs a year to learn the defense, Joe’s going to walk out on a limb and suggest he’s a bad fit. Why the Bucs chose to sit on their hands and not get a linebacker (or a receiver) because of injuries is a mystery right up there with shadows on a grassy knoll in Dallas.

Also, left tackle Tristan Wirfs’ status was downgraded to “doubtful” from “questionable.” Bowles has cautiously said more than once Wirfs would be a gametime decision.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/11/bucs-giants-matchup-highlights-differences-for-sterling-shepard/|Bucs-Giants Matchup Highlights Differences For Sterling Shepard|One strong free agent pickup by the Bucs this year has been receiver Sterling Shepard. He’s got the third-most catches among Bucs wide receivers and he’s rushed 7 times for 55 yards. Coaches and players all praise Shepard for raising the energy level of the Bucs offense, even Todd Bowles, who isn’t known for calling out energy guys. After eight years as a Giants-fan favorite with lots of highs and injury-induced lows, Shepard landed in Tampa after a call from Baker Mayfield, his old college teammate. Shepard is an emotional guy, Mayfield has said that repeatedly, so Joe has no doubt that Shepard’s return to MetLife Stadium tomorrow will mean a lot to him. Interestingly, the New York Post caught up to Shepard and he told the newspaper that being with the Bucs is a cultural football experience he’s not used to. It sounded to Joe like Shepard was trying not to throw the bumbling Giants under the bus. “It’s just different, in so many different ways and so many different levels,” Shepard said. “When it goes down to the small things, what you can do in the building as a player, the way you’re able to communicate and be hand-in-hand with the coaches. It’s just a lot of different things I kinda picked up on being [in New York] for so long. Even down to the training staff or the weight coaches and some of the different stuff that we do here, it’s a difference.” Well, Joe would hope the Bucs are a much more fine-tuned organziation than the Giants. It’s certainly showed on the field. As for Shepard on Sunday, Joe hopes he can contain his enthusiasm a bit. Giants players told the Post they expect a ton of juice from their old teammate.|2024-11-23 13:06:00|296|10|9|Sterling Shepard|Shepard boosts Bucs offense|5|Mixed sentiment with hope and concern expressed about the team's performance in the upcoming game.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Crickett Baker"", ""post"": ""He spoke of differences, but he didn\u2019t say he liked them, either.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/11/mike-evans-its-go-time/|Mike Evans: It’s Go Time|Two years ago in Todd Bowles’ first season as Bucs head coach, Tampa Bay finished the regular season 3-4 in its final seven games. That year, like this year, the bye week came after Week 10. Unlike in 2022, the Bucs didn’t begin this year’s bye week flying back from Munich. Last year, also without an international game, the Bucs were 5-2 in the final seven games. The way Joe looks at it, the Bucs cannot lose two more games and expect to make the playoffs. Yesterday, Mike Evans said the second half of the season is what the Bucs train for all year. “It’s something that we want to be good at, because the season has been unfortunate and unfortunate things happen in life and in football,” said Evans, who returns Sunday after blowing out his hamstring against the Crows. “It’s a very brutal game and injuries are going to happen. We’re definitely trying to hit our stride right now.” Can the Bucs bank on a repeat of last year? Joe isn’t sure. The Bucs don’t have Chris Godwin and the Bucs are playing awful defense. The flip side is the schedule is softer than a wet sponge found off Tarpon Springs, and the running game is 10 times better. First up tomorrow for the Bucs is one of the worst quarterbacks to start multiple games last year, Chief Illiniwek himself, third-string signal-caller Tommy Cutlets. If the Bucs lose to the tanking Giants, Joe will be sure a shakeup of some sort is coming to One Buc Palace come late January.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/11/red-zone-stardom/|Red Zone Stardom|So the Bucs were a subject on Coach. No, not the hit 1990s comedy, “Coach” is Bill Belicheat’s Xs-and-Os heavy YouTube show. Man, that show can be humbling to know-it-all fans. It’s quite an education. Belicheat was joined this week by two of his protégés, defensive guru Matt Patricia and yes-man Michael Lombardi. The discussion turned to red zone offense and the Bucs were among teams praised for scoring seven instead of three, a big focus of Belicheat. Per the graphic below, the Bucs rank third in the NFL in points per possession. And hey, isn’t that arguably the best way to judge an offense? The scoring turnaround for the Bucs is about the running game, Lombardi ranted. He said the Bucs have become dangerous and effective running the ball, especially in the red zone, after a miserable rushing attack for years. Lombardi cited Bucky Irving and got no pushback from Belicheat or Patricia. Belicheat lectured about the value of highly-mobile quarterbacks in the red zone and how they can change a defense, but he didn’t mention Baker Mayfield. Bucs fans, though, have seen enough of Mayfield’s mobility to know that’s been a factor in 2024. |2024-11-23 10:17:00|196|15|7|Red Zone Stardom|Bucs praised for red zone offense improvement.|8|Mixed sentiments about coaches and players with various levels of optimism and pessimism.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""PSL Bob"", ""post"": ""One of the best offenses in the league and one of the worst defenses.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/11/the-x-factors-fans-are-overlooking/|The X-Factors Fans Are Overlooking|So the 4-6 Bucs sure have painted themselves into a corner by losing their last four games. Many, many, many folks are pointing at the strong second half of the season last year as not just reason for hope, but as an expectation the Bucs can flip the switch and return to the playoffs. As Lee Corso famously says, “Not so fast, my friend!” One reason the Bucs went 5-2 to close the 2023 regular season was due to Chris Godwin having some of his best games of the season. In December, Godwin, had 155, 78 and 81 receiving yards in three straight games, respectively, to help put the Bucs on the doorstep of the NFC South title in December. As we all know, the Bucs gutted out a division-clinching victory on the road against the Stinking Panthers to end the regular season. This year, there’s no Godwin. He trashed his ankle against Baltimore and has since had surgery. Todd Bowles weeks ago cautiously admitted there is a scant chance Godwin could return if the Bucs reached the postseason. Sadly, the Bucs aren’t there yet. Also sadly, no Bucs receivers have stepped up to firmly secure Godwin’s WR2 status, forget WR3. Another overlooked hill to climb for the Bucs if they hope to run the table, or go 6-1 the rest of the way, is how is the defense will magically improve. The Bucs allow the sixth-most points per game at 26.6. Last year the Bucs’ defense was just the opposite: The Bucs in 2023 allowed the sixth-fewest points per game at 19.1. That’s a full touchdown difference. That’s big. No Godwin and a big-time drop in the defense are two major obstacles the Bucs must overcome if they hope to play meaningful games in January.|2024-11-23 09:15:00|296|26|3|The X-Factors Fans Are Overlooking|Bucs facing challenges without key players for playoff contention.|0|Heavy criticism of coaching and defense|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""BallHawk75"", ""post"": ""@Joe"", ""post_time"": [""November"", ""23rd,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""9:37"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""BA\u2019s Red Pen"", ""post"": ""You can\u2019t be a defensive head coach and have all the losses be because of the defense.

The Bucs are on the cusp of making history with a shameful waste of offense rarely seen in the NFL in more than a half-century. The folks at BSPN shared this stats nugget that ought to make Bucs fans hit the bottle on this otherwise fine Saturday morning. The Buccaneers are one of three teams in the Super Bowl era to average at least 27.9 points and be under .500. The other two teams (2016 Saints and 2016 Chargers) didn’t make the playoffs. So, yeah, Joe had his curiosity (only) aroused reading this. So Joe checked. And yup, just what Joe thought. The 2016 slimy Saints and the 2016 Chargers each finished the season with losing records. The slimy Saints were 7-9. The Chargers were 5-11. For the first time since Bucco Bruce Arians stepped aside, the Bucs have had a productive if not dangerous offense. And the defense then goes out on the field and vomits on itself late in games.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/11/scoring-first-critical/|Scoring First Critical|This was just sad two weeks ago. When Ricky Pearsall sliced through the Bucs secondary two Sundays ago scoring on a 46-yard pass from Brock Purdy, Joe leaned back in his chair in the press box of The Licht House and sighed. Joe softly mumbled to the Sage of Tampa Bay sports, Ira Kaufman, seated to Joe’s immediate left, ‘the Bucs just lost.’ Ira was aghast. “You mean they should just pack up and go home already?” Ira said in shock. Joe replied, “All Joe knows, Ira, is the Bucs have lost every game this year when the opponent scored first.” That sad streak (0-5) continued when San Francisco marched down the field in the final seconds with the ease of an underwear football practice — not one of Purdy’s four pass attempts on the drive hit the ground — and Jake Moody booted a 44-yard field goal at the gun for the win. (The NFL really needs to bring back the honored tradition of a ref firing off a .38 to mark the end of the game.) So Joe was reading Rich Hribar’s worksheet on Sharp Football Analysis for the Bucs-Giants game and noticed this nugget: The Giants have led for 9.9% of their offensive snaps, the lowest rate in the league. So basically the Giants — with their just-released starting quarterback Danny Dimes — have led for the fewest amount of snaps this season. If the Bucs defense allows Chief Illiniwek himself, Tommy Cutlets, a third-string quarterback, to score first, not only could a loss ruin the Bucs’ season and keep them out of the playoffs, but someone in authority at One Buc Palace has to take a good, long and thorough look under the hood why a defensive-minded head coach has such a trash defense. And yeah, if the Bucs allow Big Blue to score first and then lose to a sad sack team like the Giants, then Joe thinks it is fair to call the Bucs’ defense “trash.”|2024-11-23 00:00:00|332|23|7|Joe|Bucs struggle when opponents score first.|5|Mixed sentiments ranging from skepticism to cautious optimism about the upcoming NFL game.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Derek"", ""post"": ""Tommy Cutlets will look like John Elway on Sunday.

Te Giants knew he had it in him all along and is why they started him. Sound impossible?, So did Counsins throwing for over 500 hundred yards  twice against the Bucs. PLease, anything is possible with this defense, not in a good way. Itis well documented now, a communtator for the NFL Network said, Counsins only looks incredible againnt the Bucs, other teams not so much.\nwe will see tomorrow, but I know while not being happy about it, I can see Divitto have a hugh game!!!, absolutely!!!!"", ""post_time"": [""David"", ""Kilmer""]}}"
