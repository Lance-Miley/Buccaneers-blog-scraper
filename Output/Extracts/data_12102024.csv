https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/todd-bowles-credits-lavonte-david-halftime-speech/|Todd Bowles Credits Lavonte David Halftime Speech|Joe already wrote about Lavonte David setting a league speed mark Sunday against the Raiders. But his strong game was about more than one play. The 2024 Bucs’ leading tackler and iconic linebacker had a complete game — on and off the field. “The sack was huge, the fumble [recovery] was huge — everything he did from a tackling standpoint, a leadership standpoint and an energy standpoint,” head coach Todd Bowles told the Buccaneers Radio Network today. “Even at halftime, coming out of the locker room, he was huge with a halftime speech. And everything just flowed right along; everybody falls right in line.” David is reserved around media, but is fiery with teammates. So the rousing halftime speech doesn’t surprise Joe. However, the Bucs didn’t exactly come out strong in the third quarter, but hey, speeches are fun and can be motivating later in a game, too. Bowles praised David’s first-quarter sack on which he wasn’t blocked, noting David’s standout acceleration. And Bowles sort of implied that he liked how David didn’t pull a Devin White. “I’ve seen a lot of people miss those,” Bowles said of blitz-sack. David is great at disguising blitzes, Bowles added, in addition to beating running backs and creating havoc when he does.|2024-12-10 18:14:00|209|16|9|Lavonte David|Lavonte David leads with complete game and inspiring halftime speech.|9|Collective admiration for Lavonte David's greatness, wishing for success and recognition.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""AirCasted-BoneBruise"", ""post"": ""Lavonte is a true inspiration and we are lucky to still have him.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/mike-evans-threw-helmet-screamed-at-defense/|Mike Evans Threw Helmet, Screamed At Defense|So when CBS broadcasts a game, the network often follows up with a podcast-style segment for sideline reporters or game analysts to share things they didn’t put on the air.  On Sunday, Aditi Kinkhabwala was the sideline reporter and she was seen on TV along the Bucs’ sideline about 10 yards from Mike Evans when the Raiders had a 4th-and-5 play from the Bucs’ 29 yard line. There was only 5:44 remaining in the game and Tampa Bay led 21-10. It was biggest play of the game. Desmond Ridder, the Raiders QB, threw a quick out pass right to Jakobi Meyers, who was one yard short of the first down — and about two giant steps from Evans. Bucs cornerback Jamel Dean was in tight coverage. First, Dean missed the pass breakup, and then he missed the tackle as Meyers scampered to the Bucs’ 11 yard line. Less than a minute later, CBS showed a replay of Mike Evans screaming at the Bucs defense after that play. Kinkhabwala added more color to the festivities. “I saw Mike Evans on the Bucs sideline yesterday throw his helmet and scream at his defense to try to get more out of them,” she told NFL on CBS. Evans barking to uplift teammates is nothing new, but throwing a helmet is out of Evans’ norm. He looked super angry via the TV angle, and Joe’s very amateur lip-reading says Evans was yelling at Dean as the receiver great’s left neck vein bulged. Joe applauds this behavior from Evans, who surely knew how critical that fourth-down play could have been. Dean would be a hell of player if he had the same fire as Evans.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/most-athletic-version-of-mike-evans/|Most Athletic Version Of Mike Evans?|So two games ago, Mike Evans made a one-hand end touchdown catch that maybe 6 or 7 NFL wide receivers are even capable of hauling in. On Sunday, Evans hit a new high that impressed a teammate who spent nine years alongside him. Retired Bucs tight end Cameron Brate was talking about Evans on the Buccaneers Radio Network yesterday, specifically his huge fourth-quarter catch on 3rd-and-9 Sunday against the Raiders. Evans snagged a throw over the middle and then hurdled a defender coming at him for a big hit. Evans stuck the landing and then dragged a tackler 6 yards before getting pulled down. It was a hell of a play from a 31-year-old receiver. Evans looked heathy, angry (because he wasn’t getting enough touches?) and fired up for a huge play. “That was like, after the catch, the most athletic thing I’ve seen Mike do,” Brate said. “Not before [the catch], Mike is so elite to the catch point. We always kind of bust his chops about his YAC (yards after catch). It was awesome yesterday. That was sweet.” With 11:03 remaining against the Raiders, that Evans play was massive, as the Bucs led by only four points. It was Evans’ final target of the game. Joe wanted to see Evans get more action, and get closer to extending his historic record, but Joe can’t moan about the Tampa Bay offense. It keeps racking up points. Evans has shown two big signs of being healthy in the past two gamess. That’s enough to get Joe very excited.|2024-12-10 11:47:00|258|28|8|Mike Evans|Mike Evans impresses with athletic plays and solid performance.|4|Mix of pessimistic comments on Mike Evans' performance with some optimism and appreciation sprinkled in.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Ufcguy32"", ""post"": ""Ya bc mike typically takes a dive on the turfs  And asks come out after lol"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""10th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""11:50"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Allen Lofton"", ""post"": ""Bucs want Evans to get his thousand yards,however winning is the number one priority and retaining number one in The NFC South"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""10th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""12:12"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""rrsrq"", ""post"": ""I was screaming before that play and the Otton play, let\u2019s get some YAC from our receivers"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""10th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""12:19"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter3"": {""username"": ""A Bucs Fan"", ""post"": ""Baker can\u2019t see the middle of the field and he can\u2019t throw deep accurately consistently.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/weve-got-to-get-some-guys-healthy/|“We’ve Got To Get Some Guys Healthy”|When Joe hears Bucco Bruce Arians talk about health, it’s not a good thing. Health was a reason he first retired from the Cardinals. Health may have been a reason why he retired a second time — as Bucs coach. But Arians isn’t worried about his health, it’s the health of his former team with which he is still sort of employed. Arians appeared on the Scoop City podcast hosted by Diana Russini of The Athletic and former NFL quarterback Chase Daniel. And he was s asked about the chase for the NFC South title and the Bucs. What worries Arians most is he believes health may Pearl Harbor the team. Daniel asked Arians what concerned him most about Tampa Bay. “The health,” Arians said as he let out an audible sigh. “Right now the secondary — we’ve got to get some guys healthy to play defense. “Todd is so hamstrung on what he can do, defensively. He loves pressure. He loves man-to-man but he doesn’t play man anymore because he doesn’t have any corners. “Now with Antoine [Winfield] hurt, hopefully we get him back.” Now look, Joe is a monster fan of Arians. Loved everything about him. May have been the best coach the Bucs have ever had. However, earlier in the podcast, he said how his daily retirement routine at his The Villages for Retired Football Coaches in Georgia includes morning golf, a cocktail or two and more golf. So Joe wonders if Arians sat down for this interview right before his second tee time of the day. Corners are the problem with the Bucs? So Bowles wants to play man defense but can’t because of the corners? Joe thought the Bucs were very high on Zyon McCollum and he’s a guy Bowles developed. Joe even thought McCollum has played good ball in his first year as a starter. Was Arians indirectly suggesting Bowles has lost faith in Jamel Dean? He’s only on the second year of a new contract. These just seemed like wild comments to Joe. Arians added offense is not an issue. “They are scoring points. You don’t have to worry about — Baker [Mayfield], he is going to get his points. Liam [Coen] had done a great job with this offense in putting those guys [in position to make plays]. “Especially with Mike Evans and Chris Godwin out, they are still scoring 28 points. They don’t have to worry about that.” Arians then reiterated that if the defense can get healthy, the Bucs can be a dangerous team protect leads. Later, Arians was asked what he misses about the game, he said the camaraderie and the fun of creating gameplans. But what he does not miss is how injuries can ruin a good club. Sadly, we may be seeing that very thing happen to the 2024 Bucs.|2024-12-10 10:28:00|473|40|5|Bucco Bruce Arians|Arians discusses concerns about team health and defensive struggles.|4|Mixed sentiments with concerns about injuries, defense, and coaching decisions.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Jeffrey Becker"", ""post"": ""he means depth, b/c corners need breaks when they\u2019re man to man more often than when they\u2019re in zone"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""10th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""10:18"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Jeffrey Becker"", ""post"": ""but i agree, bowles could still play it more"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""10th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""10:18"", ""am""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""Ds"", ""post"": ""Dean can\u2019t play man"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""10th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""10:20"", ""am""]}, ""commenter3"": {""username"": ""Tony"", ""post"": ""That\u2019s why they need to hang onto all of their draft picks or if anything trade down as much as possible & build the team as much as possible, too!

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/rachaad-white-wins-angry-runs-of-the-week/|Rachaad White Wins “Angry Runs” Of The Week|Yeah, Joe knows “Good Morning Football,” seen weekday mornings on NFL Network, hasn’t been the same since Kay Adams left. And it also took a couple of steps back when it moved to Los Angeles this past summer. Still, the show has closet Bucs fan Peter Schrager and Kyle Brandt. Those two alone make it light years better than any morning show on standard cable/satellite/streaming. For years, Brandt has had a weekly in-season segment called “Angry Runs” where he highlights the best physical runs each week. Two years ago, Bucs running back Rachaad White won the coveted “Angry Runs” scepter. To this day, if you ask Joe for one play that springs to mind that White made, it was when the Bucs played the Seahawks in Munich. White stiff-armed Seahawks corner Quandre Diggs into the Hofbrauhaus on a run to the left side. Joe was very fortunate to be able to witness that feat with his own eyes from the opposite side of the field. Bouncers throughout the Tampa Bay area have since perfected that move. Well, White did the same thing  Sunday to Raiders corner Decamerion Richardson. White ran left and stiff-armed Richardson onto the front parking lot like a bouncer at one of those clothing-optional establishments that dot Dale Mabry Highway. It was beautiful. Out the door you go! And White’s move did not go unnoticed to Brandt who deemed White this week’s winner of “Angry Runs.” And with the honor, goes the scepter, which White has already posed with. Nice job, Rachaad. It wasn’t quite as glorious as making a defender eat turf on foreign soil making him wish he never had a passport, but it was still very cool.|2024-12-10 10:27:00|283|18|7|Rachaad White|"NFL Network's ""Angry Runs"" segment winner praised by host."|7|Mixed sentiment with praise for players' improvement despite some negative comments and criticisms.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""dls5492"", ""post"": ""Awesome!"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""10th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""10:30"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""infomeplease"", ""post"": ""RW1 does produce a scepter runs every few years!

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/no-issues-lavonte-david-sets-nfl-speed-mark/|“No Issues” Lavonte David Earns NFL Speed Mark|Joe’s got two sweet nuggets from Lavonte David’s locker and Sunday’s JumboTron at The Licht House. So David racked up his fourth sack of the season early in the first quarter Sunday against the Raiders. Soon after, the Bucs flashed an official NFL NextGen graphic on the stadium JumboTron that showed David’s time from snap of the ball to touching the quarterback on his blitz was 3.04 seconds. It was the fastest sack of the day in the NFL, per the Bucs’ promotion. Joe thought that was cool but also snickered. It wasn’t even 1:30 p.m. So Joe made a note to check the NextGen data today to find where that David sack ranked for speed in all Week 14 action. And guess, what, David’s sack held up as the fastest in the NFL last week. (Video below). After the January playoff game in Detroit, Bucs fans heard David mic’d up and talking to Detroit backup QB Teddy Bridgewater. David was saying he might be done with football. It was a long, punishing season. On Sunday, Joe grabbed David solo after the game and asked him how he feels about his body versus last year in mid-December, and about playing for the 2025 season. “I’m blessed, man. No issues,” David said of his health. “I just go out there to play football and that’s what I’m going to keep on doing.” As for 2025, all David specifically would say is that he’s just focused now on winning each day. David turns 35 in January. But Joe thinks David saying he’s got no issues — he’s been open about issues in past seasons — is a great sign that David is not interested in hanging up his cleats. Do the Bucs want David back? Sage Ira Kaufman was emphatic on his podcast that the Bucs absolutely want David in 2025, assuming David wants it, too.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/bucs-offense-has-guardrails/|Bucs Offense Has Guardrails|Indirectly, the crowd at The 33rd Team seems to believe Bucs offensive coordinator Liam Coen has done an incredible job. In short, when someone struggles on offense or is out injured, Coen develops strategies to cover for them. Specifically, Dan Pizzuta said Coen has “built-in guardrails” for Baker Mayfield if he has a crummy day — and he did Sunday. He’s found other ways to move the ball to cover up for Mayfield in the form of Bucky Irving and Rachaad White. But the Tampa Bay Buccaneers have more built-in guardrails to keep the offense successful. The screen game is still deadly, and a rotating group of running backs has been efficient in this offense. Bucky Irving came into this game with an injury and left in the second quarter. In his absence, Rachaad White ran 17 times for 90 yards and a touchdown. And Pizzuta is right: The Bucs have various ways of hitting a defense. It’s not just the run game, but which back (Sean Tucker, included). It’s not just the passing game, but which receiver and which tight end? On Sunday, Jalen McMillan finally lived up to all his offseason hype. His two touchdowns, 15- and 29-yards, represented the first and last Bucs’ touchdowns. So the Bucs don’t need to ride Mayfield’s back in order to score. They have the ninth-most rushing toucdowns in the league and six TD receptions on short throws to running backs.|2024-12-10 09:00:00|239|24|7|Bucs Offense|Coen-led offense has built-in guardrails for success.|5|Mixed sentiments about team performance and coaches, with some focus on individual players.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""74 Bucs Fan"", ""post"": ""Joe \u2013 do you fear that when the Bucs offense bogs down mid game after gaining a lead, as it often does, that the focus shifts to Evans and trying to secure that 1000 yard season record?

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/that-gets-in-your-quarterbacks-head/|“That Gets In Your Quarterback’s Head”|So Bucs superstar left tackle Tristan Wirfs isn’t just protecting Baker Mayfield’s body, he’s also protecting his mental state. Joe is on record not being a “quarterback pressures” guy. Pressures aren’t a significant factor for quality quarterbacks. But “hits,” sure, those are felt and remembered by quarterbacks. Sacks, of course, are drive-killers can disrupt QBs in many ways. Wirfs talked about the strong job he and right tackle Luke Goedeke did Sunday against Pro Bowl edge rusher Maxx Crosby and the Raiders, via the Buccaneers Radio Network. Crosby didn’t have his typical superstar day, and Wirfs heaped a lot of praise on Goedeke for playing “out of his mind.” Wirfs, however, was upset with himself for giving up Crosby’s lone QB hit early in the game but said he adjusted successfuly and quickly. Overall, per Wirfs, the Bucs’ tackles didn’t alter their games for Crosby but did focus on keeping Crosby out of Baker Mayfield’s head. “Just doing our best to stay connected to him not let him get those little touches after the play and stuff,” Wirfs said. “You know, that gets in your quarterback’s head; that gets in everybody’s head. So doing our best to limit that was I think the main gameplan.” The Bucs tackles had a strong day, but it seemed the interior Raiders’ pass rush did rattle Mayfield. Bucs left guard Ben Bredeson certainly had too many rough moments. But Joe was intrigued by Wirfs talking about how even late touches, pokes and taps on a quarterback by pass rushers can rattle the QB. Was he speaking about all QBs, the Bucs QBs he’s played with, or just Mayfield?|2024-12-10 08:13:00|274|16|9|Tristan Wirfs|Wirfs protects Mayfield's mental state from opposing pass rushers.|6|Mixed sentiments on QB performance, pressure, and officiating, with some optimism about future success.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Leopold Stotch"", ""post"": ""That\u2019s a good question, Joe.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/dominant-bucs-run-game-its-true/|Dominant Bucs Run Game — It’s True!|The past two years, the Bucs’ run game was garbage. Too negative you say? Well, what else is Joe supposed to call the No. 32 team in rushing two straight seasons? Heck, Tristan Wirfs himself was on the Buccaneers Radio Network yesterday gushing about this year’s run game a lamenting how weak it was in past seasons. This year? Joe doesn’t know whether to thank Bucs coach Todd Bowles for hiring Liam Coen, or to thank Coen or offensive line coach Kevin Carberry — or to thank the front office for scouting and drafting Bucky Irving or jus thank Irving. Maybe all five get kudos? Whoever gets the props, the Bucs have made a stunning turnaround, from worst to almost first. The Bucs are fourth in yards per attempt (5.1) and eighth in rushing yards per game (138.3). The resurrection of the Bucs’ run game is mostly from two running backs, Rachaad White and Irving. There are only two one-two punches in the NFL that have combined for 800 scrimmage yards this season. One duo is Irving and White. The other? Jahmyr Gibbs & David Montgomery. Pretty cool company the Bucs’ running backs are keeping there. https://twitter.com/andrew_holman2/status/1866123955758608420|2024-12-10 07:00:00|197|15|7|Dominant Bucs Run Game|Bucs turning run game around|8|Overall positive sentiment with praise for players, desire for more carries, and optimism for future.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Boomer"", ""post"": ""Revamped and improved line play \u2013 the addition of Graham Barton and left guard Ben Bredeson a big plus."", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""10th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""7:16"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Bucsfan"", ""post"": ""I would heap tons of praise on Graham Barton addition at Center.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/bucs-defense-had-25-plays-sunday-where-lavonte-david-was-only-linebacker-on-the-field/|Bucs Defense Had 25 Plays Sunday Where Lavonte David Was Only Linebacker On The Field|Joe understands a lot of Bucs fans seem put off by Todd Bowles because in public, he fronts the image of someone who has less of a heartbeat than Bill Belichick when he was forced to do his press conferences in New England. But the ice on Bowles — who is a borderline gregarious guy when away from prying cameras — broke yesterday when it was mentioned to Bowles that on 25 defensive plays, the only inside linebacker Bowles had on the field was Bucs icon Lavonte David. Bowles actually broke out laughing when this stat was pointed out to him — and acknowledged the intel was correct. Joe finds this move both funny as hell and very, very savvy. What is Joe’s common saying (stolen from Nick Saban) about offense? Get the ball in the hands of your best players. Well, on defense, what’s the best way to play defense? Get your best 11 defenders on the field. With the inside linebackers so beat up with injuries, the Bucs turned to Vi Jones, who had been on the roster for some 11 months before Bowles deemed him “ready” to be on the active roster. So who would you trust on the field? Another outside linebacker (hey, at least those guys have experience — not sacking the quarterback, but experience nonetheless), an experienced defensive back or someone who is green as grass? Or, instead of a stiff of an inside linebacker who more likely is an albatross, why not use a Bucs’ defensive back who has played a lot of snaps this year? So what did Bowles hope to accomplish with only one linebacker on the field? After he finished laughing he explained. “Smoke and mirrors [laughs], smoke and mirrors,” Bowles smiled. “We have a couple packages that were kind of unorthodox that we’ve been practicing. The safeties do a good job filling in at linebacker.” What Bowles referred to as an “unorthodox” defense included him thinking safeties and nickel corners would cover Raiders tight ends Brock Bowers and Michael Mayer better than a practice squad inside linebacker who just recently became “ready.” Joe thought this was a very, very savvy and smart move by Bowles. Where is there an 11th Commandment that a linebacker must guard a tight end? There isn’t. Bowers is like a big wide receiver so why not have quicker defenders on him? Hats off to Bowles for thinking outside the box with his defense in a pinch.|2024-12-10 07:00:00|412|33|7|Todd Bowles|Bowles deploys innovative defense strategy with Lavonte David as lone linebacker.|5|Mixed sentiments towards Coach Bowles, varying from praise to criticism.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Sean G"", ""post"": ""Great job Coach Bowles, the defense was ready to play and they showed it by only giving up 13 points.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/have-defenses-figured-out-baker-mayfields-kryptonite/|Have Defenses Figured Out Baker Mayfield’s Kryptonite?|Joe has stated on several occasions that this Bucs offense is dink-and-dunk. But that is nitpicking since the offense is working. The offense is not the Bucs’ problem. Joe last week asked offensive coordinator Liam Coen if his lack of throwing deep may doom the offense. He didn’t think so. Hey, through 12 games, the offense, despite rarely throwing past 20 yards from the line of scrimmage, was working well. Then came Sunday when Baker Mayfield struggled. He didn’t just struggle with the offense, but he threw a pair of picks and a lost fumble. Jenna Laine of ESPN suggests the Raiders were taking away the Bucs’ meat and potatoes of the passing offense: short passes. Starting in the second quarter, the Raiders were able to disrupt quarterback Baker Mayfield’s passes to the flats and out routes. … Mayfield was 7-of-13 for 84 yards, two touchdowns and an interception on passes for 5 or fewer air yards, according to ESPN Research. His 54% completion percentage on those throws is tied for his lowest with the Bucs. Since the Bucs don’t often throw deep, Joe would expect defenses to focus on short passes. Again, the Bucs are entering their 14th game on Sunday. That’s a pretty big sample size. So defenses are just now figuring out Coen doesn’t like to throw deep, or that the Bucs don’t have anyone to go deep effectively without blowing a hamstring? Joe has a hunch it was the defensive front of the Raiders that caused most of the problems. The Bucs’ offensive line likely had its worst game pass protecting of the season. A strong pass rush just screws up an offense no matter what it is trying to do. It’s hard for Joe to believe the Raiders are the first team this season that focused on the Bucs’ short passing game and Mayfield wilted as a result.|2024-12-10 00:00:00|313|33|4|Baker Mayfield|Bucs offense struggles due to defensive pressure on short passes.|5|Mixed opinions on Baker's performance and offensive strategies, concerns about injuries and play calling.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Pewter Power"", ""post"": ""Agreed yea it was the raiders front but they weren\u2019t able to do anything to baker in crunch time.
