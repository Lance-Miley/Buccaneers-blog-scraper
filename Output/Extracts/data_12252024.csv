https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/blocking-for-mike-evans/|Blocking For Mike Evans|Of course, Joe watched the Bucs-Cowboys film and saw an opportunity or two for Mike Evans that didn’t materialize.  It happens. But it’s extra painful when nearly every Bucs fan is aching for Evans to hit 1,000 yards receiving for the 11th consecutive season. He’s got 818 yards with two games remaining. Joe let it go but Todd Bowles went there on the Buccaneers Radio Network last night. “We missed some shots that we had [Evans] 1-on-1 that we could have taken right there due to other things up front and with the quarterback,” Bowles said. “So, we can do a better job getting him the ball in certain situations.” Bowles acknowledged it wasn’t the Bucs’ best night of pass blocking compared to other games, though Bowles praised how the Bucs handled Micah Parsons through Sunday’s game. Hearing Bowles made Joe hope every offensive player takes ownership and responsibility for Evans’ streak and him potentially tying Jerry Rice for the all-time record on Sunday or next week. The offensive line has had a great year, but perhaps they can have an even better finish if they remember they’re blocking for Evans, the greatest Tampa Bay offensive player of all-time.|2024-12-25 16:47:00|199|16|5|Mike Evans|Effort to get Mike Evans to 1|3|Comments vary from overly optimistic to highly critical of team performance and coaching decisions.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Allen Lofton"", ""post"": ""Mike Evans has played some of his best games against the Carolina Panters.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/baker-mayfield-spreading-christmas-cheer-except-to-the-shipping-industry/|Baker Mayfield Spreading Christmas Cheer — Except To The Shipping Industry|Bucs quarterback was in the Christmas spirit yesterday at One Buc Palace. For the most part. Mayfield had lumps of coal to put in someone’s stocking. He ordered special presents for his offensive linemen but the delivery has been delayed and they won’t get them on time for today. Mayfield is not happy about what he referred to as “big parcel.” But Mayfield was in the holiday spirit spreading good will to backup tight end Payne Durham. The Purdue product has been relegated to being an afterthought in the passing game after Cade Otton raised his game in the wake of the Chris Godwin injury. Joe thinks it’s fair to say the Bucs missed Otton in Texas on Sunday night. But Durham came through with some big catches and even absorbed a helluva hit. Joe is still a bit surprised Durham didn’t have cracked ribs. He took a shot! So Mayfield gave Durham serious props for having a solid game for the Bucs. “I thought Payne did a great job filling in for Cade [Otton],” Mayfield said. “I think he was able to show that some of his route running and just catching the ball – that ability – he’s got great hands.” Before the Cowboys game, Durham has been mainly used as a blocker and he’s rather good at that. Mayfield suggested Durham is more than just a blocker. “He’s not as twitchy as Cade but [he has] a little bit bigger frame so we trust him, and he obviously does a lot for us in the run game when Cade is playing too,” Mayfield said. (Joe never thought of Otton as “twitchy.”) Hopefully, Otton will be back for Sunday against the Stinking Panthers. And yeah, while Joe thought the Bucs missed Otton, it wasn’t a major dropoff with Durham. Let’s be real: The Bucs didn’t lose to the Cowboys because of Durham.|2024-12-25 12:00:00|314|16|5|Baker Mayfield|Mayfield spreads holiday cheer but offensive line delivery delayed.|3|Mixed sentiments with some optimism and pessimism regarding player performance and team losses.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Outrigger"", ""post"": ""Other than the fumble which we recovered Durham was solid Sunday night."", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""25th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""12:47"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Jethro Tull"", ""post"": ""The Bucs lost to the Cowboys for the same reason they lost twice to the Falcons, to the Niners, and to the Chiefs ."", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""25th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""2:01"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""ModHairKen"", ""post"": ""One of the players who needed to step up.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/the-weird-scoring-first-stat/|The Weird Scoring-First Stat|Joe could understand if the following took place during the reign of former Bucs commander Greg Schiano, with rookie QB Mike Glennon leading his offense. (And let’s be real: It wouldn’t have been much better with veteran Glennon leading Schiano’s offense.) But to have an offense like the Bucs have with Liam Coen calling the shots, the second-best offensive coordinator in Bucs history, unable to rally to a win from even a small deficit early is just weird. The Bucs are winless this season when they do not score first. When the Bucs do score first, they’re 8-1. Yes, that means even if the Bucs only trail 3-0, like what happened in North Texas on Sunday night, it is apparently an insurmountable obstacle. Bowles was asked about this yesterday. “Fast starts are a huge part, especially for us,” Bowles said. “We’ve got to get off to a fast start. “I think we can come from behind, but when you get out and get a lead early and you’re able to pad that lead, it helps you play a little better.” Well so far, the Bucs have not been able to win from behind, at least when the opponent scores first. This is so weird to Joe. The Bucs are fifth in the NFL in points per game (28.5) but no matter, if the opponent scores first, the Bucs are doomed. Last year under former Bucs offensive coordinator Dave Canales, the Bucs never scored a touchdown on their opening drive. Under Coen, the Bucs score plenty and lead the NFL in first-quarter scoring. Yet last year, even when the Bucs notoriously started slow, they damn near got to the NFC title game. But even with a high-powered offense under Coen, the Bucs cannot overcome a 3-0 hole.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/truth-sometimes-hurts/|Truth Sometimes Hurts|Sunday night after the Bucs may have blown their chances at making the postseason, there was a question that didn’t sit well with Bucs coach Todd Bowles. There, Jenna Laine of ESPN asked Bowles why the middle of his defense was vulnerable to the pass for the Cowboys to exploit. That question didn’t seem below the belt to Joe. Bowles didn’t like it and waved off the insinuation that the middle of his pass defense was soft — and the reason why the Bucs are clinging to playoff hopes by their fingernails. Well, Bowles may not want to read the PFF tribe. It seems, per Timo Riske, the Bucs did indeed get carved up between the hashmarks by Troy Aikman Cooper Rush. Why the Buccaneers lost: The Buccaneers struggled to defend the middle of the field against the Cowboys, with Cooper Rush completing 21 of his 24 pass attempts between the numbers for 192 yards. The majority of Rush’s pass attempts were behind the line of scrimmage or between 1-10 yards, but the Buccaneers still struggled to stop the short passing game and felt the ramifications. Now did the Bucs get gouged in the middle of the field because their starting safeties are on the shelf with injuries? Seems logical. Did Aikman Rush flaunt the middle of the field because he had time to order brisket to go from Pecan Lodge? Well, that certainly didn’t help the Bucs’ cause.|2024-12-25 08:00:00|239|69|5|Todd Bowles|Bucs defense vulnerable to passes in recent game.|1|The sentiment is overwhelmingly pessimistic towards Todd Bowles and the defense's performance.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Buchen61"", ""post"": ""They were soft in the middle long before the injuries set in so lets just quit with the excuses"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""25th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""8:16"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""JustOneGame"", ""post"": ""When you have a 350 DT dropping into coverage there\u2019s going to be open zones, not really a brain buster"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""25th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""8:21"", ""am""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""Smashsquatch"", ""post"": ""Bucs D woes always falls on the players.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/dan-graziano-still-has-faith-in-bucs/|Dan Graziano Still Has Faith In Bucs|While his colleague at the four-letter, follicly-challenged Billy Barnwell, doesn’t even consider the Bucs Atlanta a contender (he listed weakest links for all Super Bowl contenders but did not include any NFC South team), Dan Graziano is not ready to throw in the towel on the Bucs. Graziano is just not feeling it with the Dixie Chicks. It seems if he were a betting man, Graziano would lay cash that the Dixie Chicks cough up their hard-earned first-place position in the division someway, somehow. … all the Falcons have to do is win their last two games to become division champs. I just don’t fully trust them to do it. Washington just beat the Eagles, and Carolina is playing hard despite having been eliminated for some time. And Tampa Bay, regardless of a bad loss Sunday night in Dallas, has been playing much better than Atlanta over the past month and is likely to be favored in both of its remaining games. Well, just like Graziano doesn’t trust the Dixie Chicks, Joe’s cannot trust the Bucs, either. You do not know which team will come to play and whether the team will be prepared to play (or want to?) for 60 minutes. The Bucs looked so dynamite against the Chargers on the West Coast, then a week later looked like they were coming home from the bar after six hours of football watching. The Bucs should beat the Stinking Panthers but dang, Carolina took the Bucs to overtime and it took a miracle by Anthony Nelson for the Bucs to dodge a bullet. That shouldn’t happen to teams with their backs against the wall like the Bucs, thanks to too many games like that this year. So which Bucs team shows up Sunday, the good Bucs (curb-stomped the Chargers) or bad Bucs (embarrassing showing in Dallas)?|2024-12-25 00:00:00|306|26|3|Dan Graziano|Dan Graziano doubts Bucs success due to inconsistent performance.|3|Commenters express doubt, frustration, and concern about the team's inconsistency and coaching decisions.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Saskbucs"", ""post"": ""We can only hope they took the Panthers lightly in round 1 and correct some issues after getting dragged this week."", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""25th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""12:20"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Mr_Barf"", ""post"": ""Here\u2019s the real blow.

We watch it over and over yet we somehow think it will change. The Bucs d just doesn\u2019t have the players to run Bowl\u2019s defense, however, he is to stuborn to acknowledge or has nothing else. The  D lacks outside rushers. We expect David to hold up the others in the middle when at his age the other lb\u2019s should be holding him up.  The secondary is weak . They miss Davis, and the safeties are not playing well. So when you fail to get a pass rush and the back end of your D is soft, the Bucs are showing exactly what happens.
