https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/jordan-whitehead-kameron-johnson-activated/|Jordan Whitehead, Kameron Johnson Activated|The Bucs got at least one valuable reinforcement back today. Safety Jordan Whitehead was activated off the injured reserve list. He is eligible to play Sunday against the Stinking Panthers. Same with wide receiver Kameron Johnson, who also came off injured reserve. Whitehead injured a pec in the blowout win of the Giants right after the bye week. The Bucs, in a series of moves, per Scott Smith of Buccaneers.com, weren’t done. They released linebacker Vi Jones to make room for the signing of Bucs sacks king Shaq Barrett. The Jones move is strange to Joe. The team spent 11 months getting Jones “ready,” as Bucs coach Todd Bowles deemed it earlier this year, to play when needed. Now, even after making some plays the past couple of weeks, the Bucs deemed him not worthy. As a result, Jones is looking for work with eight days remaining in the regular season.|2024-12-28 16:09:00|151|33|7|Jordan Whitehead and Kameron Johnson|Bucs activate key players|2|Mixed sentiment with some optimism but mostly negative and critical comments.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Tampabaybucfan"", ""post"": ""Welcome back, Jordan."", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""28th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""4:26"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Hodad"", ""post"": ""If they now believe Shaq is an upgrade over Jones I have even less faith in Bowles, and Licht."", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""28th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""4:33"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""Saskbucs"", ""post"": ""Hard to say the Bucs haven\u2019t mismanaged that ILB position this year.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/bucky-irving-is-blowing-up-the-league/|Bucky Irving Is Blowing Up The League|Man, the more Joe thinks of it, the more Joe is impressed by what a total steal the Bucs got drafting rookie Bucky Irving in the fourth round. Bucky is one of the best running backs in the league already, even though he’s not permitted to touch the football in the final minutes of close games. Irving NFL for rookies in scrimmage yards, rushing yards and touchdowns. That’s a well-rounded back. Additionally, Irving averages 4.2 yards after contact. That’s nuts, especially considering how much initial contact he avoids. That also leads all running backs who have at least 50 carries. So yeah, the way the Stinking Panthers cannot defend the run and the way Irving is slicing through defenses, Bucs offensive coordinator Liam Coen really should revisit his stance of not using Irving late in games because he’s not Anthony Muñoz. The Bucs have their backs against the wall. They can’t play it safe any longer, not if they want to play meaningful football in January.|2024-12-28 12:00:00|166|33|7|Bucky Irving|Rookie running back Bucky Irving impresses with stellar performance.|4|Some optimism mixed with frustration, disappointment, and uncertainty about player performance and team outcomes.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""JTHV"", ""post"": ""Throw it to Mike for 200 and 3td\u2019s and we blow the Panthers out of the building early to let Tucker clean up the mess.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/panthers-move-to-tank-season-place-chuba-hubbard-on-injured-reserve/|Panthers Move To Tank Season; Place Chuba Hubbard On Injured Reserve|So yesterday, Joe listened to Panthers head coach Dave Canales say all his players listed as “questionable” on the Carolina injury report were expected to play Sunday at The Licht House in Tampa. One was Panthers running back Chuba Hubbard. He had 25 carries for 152 yards and 2 touchdowns last Sunday against Arizona. Today, however, the Panthers ended Hubbard’s season by placing him on injured reserve. Hubbard, a 1,000-yard rusher and the heart and soul of the Carolina offense, was grinding through a knee issue pretty damn well. In fact, that “bad knee” wasn’t even on yesterday’s injury report; Hubbard was given “rest” but no injury was listed. This is called tanking for a draft pick, Joe believes. Man, the Bucs should be thanking the football gods. However, the Bucs’ run defense did neuter Hubbard when the teams squared off on Dec. 1.|2024-12-28 10:36:00|144|57|4|Chuba Hubbard|Panthers tank season|2|Mixed sentiments with frustration toward coaching, uncertainty about playoffs, and criticizing defensive performance.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""pewter941"", ""post"": ""Hopefully Washington takes care of Atlanta."", ""post_time"": [""pewter941""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""View from 132"", ""post"": ""The Bucs controlled their own path to the playoffs and let it go.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/run-to-win-5/|Run To Win|In recent weeks, the Stinking Panthers have been fairly stout against the pass. In fact, Carolina has been good enough with its pass defense that the last time the Stinking Panthers gave up over 200 yards passing in a game was against the Bucs on Dec. 1. Yeah, that was the overtime game, where the Bucs needed a miracle from Anthony Nelson to win. How many yards passing did Baker Mayfield have that day? Try 209. So with the Bucs facing a pass defense that may be overlooked, why not run? In their last four games, the Stinking Panthers have been gouged on the ground allowing over 200 yards a game this month, including 236 yards by the Bucs. The Stinking Panthers have the No. 32 run defense in the league, and rain and wind is in the weather forecast. Bucs offensive coordinator Liam Coen sort of pondered out loud this week that maybe he needs to get the ball to star rookie running back Bucky Irving more. Well, if Coen has any thoughts about doing that, now is the time. The Bucs have their backs against the wall. Joe doesn’t want to see Irving get any fewer than 15 carries tomorrow.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/a-new-years-wish-list/|A New Year’s Wish List|BY IRA KAUFMAN It’s almost time to turn the page on 2024, which means it’s time to read between the lines for the Buccaneers. As we approach the new year, players, coaches and staff are looking forward to a fresh start. Here’s what they’re craving in 2025: Chris Godwin: An enticing offer to return to One Buc Place before free agency, followed by a complete recovery from that dislocated ankle. Lavonte David: Another one-year contract extension to lead a young defense and add to a potential Hall of Fame resume. The Glazers: A legitimate Super Bowl contender to mark the 50th year of the franchise. Jason Licht: A nasty edge rusher falling into his lap on draft day. Baker Mayfield: A dynamic receiver who can stretch the field and excel at yards after the catch. Antoine Winfield Jr.: A healthy season to help fans remember what a game-wrecker he can be. Liam Coen: An offer he can’t refuse from Buc ownership to stay in Tampa and tweak an already imposing offense. Bucky Irving: More touches. Jamel Dean: More interceptions. Todd Bowles: A sense of job security. Mike Greenberg: A GM title elsewhere after 15 years with the Bucs. Chris Braswell: Redemption after a forgettable rookie season. Luke Goedeke: A contract extension for one of the NFL’s premier offensive tackles. Tykee Smith: An offseason emphasis on blitzing techniques. Punter: Player to be named later. Mike Evans: Enough TD catches to move past Tony Gonzalez into eighth place on the all-time list. Calijah Kancey: Further recognition as one of the league’s most disruptive defensive tackles. Jordan Whitehead: A good, hard look in the mirror. Kyle Trask: An opportunity to compete somewhere else. Joe Tryon-Shoyinka: Ditto. Zyon McCollum: The freedom to shadow the opposition’s best receiver all over the field. Graham Barton: A thank you for a solid rookie year … now work on your snaps. Cade Otton: Continued growth for a dependable target and blocker. Jalen McMillan: More consistency, especially early in the season. SirVocea Dennis: A starting job to flash his skills. Bruce Arians: Long, straight drives from the tee box. Rachaad White: A dozen touchdowns. Trainer Bobby Slater: A less hectic season. Secondary coaches Kevin Ross and Nick Rapone: More interceptions. Lots more. Ring of Honor: A recipient, any recipient, after a 2-year hiatus. Buc Nation: A team that wins the close ones, especially against Atlanta.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/chris-braswell-gets-a-gift/|Chris Braswell Gets A Gift|Sadly, Buccaneers rookie edge rusher Chris Braswell played just 8 defensive snaps — total — in the past two games. Way too early for the “B” word, but that’s a bad sign. Braswell has proven durable in his 300-plus snaps, but the second-round pick has generated little excitement. And it’s a little disturbing that he hasn’t eclipsed Joe Tryon-Shoyinka on the Bucs’ depth chart at outside linebacker. If you haven’t realized, the Bucs’ edge pass rush is inept. Still, Braswell is a rookie and rookie edge rushers usually are overwhelmed. That’s one reason Joe is so happy Bucs sacks king Shaq Barrett was just re-signed. Barrett was a great mentor to YaYa Diaby last season (is that a reason Diaby has fallen off?), and if nothing else, perhaps Barrett can impart lessons to the rookie before the season wraps up. Joe’s not peeing on the leadership of Anthony Nelson, who is known as a super smart player eager to help teammates, but Shaq represents a different breed of mentor.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/stinking-panthers-at-bucs-tv-map-2/|Stinking Panthers At Bucs, TV Map|Bucs fans in Florida, the NFL is trying to divide you.  Joe gets a lot of complaints from Bucs fans in Orlando, Jacksonville, Southwest Florida and the Treasure Coast that local TV stations are instead piping in the Jags, the Dolphins, the Steelers, the Cowboys or the Packers. Well, this Sunday, if you live in Florida and want to watch the Bucs free, Joe hopes you live in Central Florida. Basically, the state of Florida will be carved up by the NFL. Folks in north Florida will get the Jags. Folks in South Florida will get the Dolphins. Folks in the Panhandle will get the Bucs. And yes, Central Florida, including Orlando, will have the Bucs broadcast on their local CBS affiliates. Yes, CBS. The game today with the Stinking Panthers will be on CBS (WTSP-TV Channel 10 locally). The old rules of NFC games exclusively airing on FOX affiliates no longer apply. Bucs fans in Oklahoma and most of the Old Confederacy will see the Bucs via their local CBS affiliates as well. Other than that, if you want to watch the Bucs, it’s either Sunday Ticket or head to the local bar. Ian Eagle, Charles Davis and Evan Washburn will handle the call.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/analysis-mike-evans-is-carrying-bucs-passing-game/|Analysis: Mike Evans Is Carrying Bucs Passing Game|Forgive Mike Evans if he has a sore back. Because he’s carrying the Bucs’ passing offense. That’s the word from one of the foremost football minds in the world of analytics, and that’s the creator of DVOA and the founder of Football Outsiders (RIP), Aaron Schatz. Last year after Schatz sold his baby Football Outsiders and as a result watched it go kaput, Schatz shifted his work to FTN Fantasy where he still works his superior analytics-based analysis, replete with DVOA data. (Don’t ask Joe to define “DVOA” but it is largely recognized as solid data.) Anyway, Schatz was digging and found something that ought to freak out Bucs fans. Since Chris Godwin went down with his ankle injury against the Crows, the Bucs have downright sucked against man coverage, Schatz’s research shows. That is, with the exception of Evans. And look out now, Schatz types for BSPN, the Bucs’ last two opponents run primarily man-coverage defenses and the slimy Saints are better at it than many may realize. According to FTN Fantasy charting, Mayfield ranks 33rd of 42 qualified quarterbacks in DVOA against man coverage since Week 7. Mike Evans, the Bucs’ other star receiver, hasn’t been the issue, as he has a 28.5% DVOA against man coverage this season. The problem is everyone else. Receivers Sterling Shepard and Jalen McMillan, along with tight end Cade Otton, all have negative DVOA ratings against man looks. Week 7 is when Godwin was lost for the season. Joe is a little surprised at this because, hey, if the Bucs were really this rotten against man coverage, wouldn’t opponents run almost nothing but man against the Bucs? In fact, Otton, before he got hurt before the Dallas game, was playing some of his best ball of his career. Did he make his plays mostly against zone coverage? Schatz is one of the smartest football analysts Joe’s met and knows. So Schatz’s research findings are very, very interesting to Joe.|2024-12-28 08:00:00|327|12|8|Mike Evans|Mike Evans carries Bucs passing game|7|Mixed sentiment with some optimism and complaints about coaching and defensive vulnerabilities.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Lt.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/i-want-so-badly-for-liam-coen-to-get-hired-somewhere-else/|“I Want So Badly For Liam Coen To Get Hired Somewhere Else”|Bucs fans, what did you do to Ben Solak? The BSPN NFL columnist and analyst seems to be a pleasant fellow. Joe used to periodically listen to his Ringer podcast. And Joe reads his columns on the four-letter’s website. But what did Bucs fans do to sour Solak on them? Appearing on his colleague Mina Kimes’ podcast this week, Solak noted that Bucs fans who Twitter him seem to have a strong desire to wash their hands of current coach Todd Bowles and promote offensive coordinator Liam Coen to replace him. Joe can understand the argument. Bowles, a defensive guy, has not been able to fix his woeful pass defense. And the Bucs just do not have an edge rush, despite plenty of draft capital this decade spent on edge rushers. It’s so bad the Bucs are even bringing Shaq Barrett out of mothballs. Yet Bucs coaches seem fully indifferent to an edge rush. This just drives Joe mental and up a tree. So, Bucs fans, seeing Coen work magic with the Bucs offense and seeing Bowles’ defense drag the team down, would rather Coen take over the Bucs. Bowles, for reasons that Joe is unclear about, has never been a popular figure with Bucs fans, despite getting the Bucs to two straight division titles in his first two years as Bucs head coach, and maybe a third in three years within the next eight days. So apparently Bucs fans may be bombarding Solak with pleas for the Bucs to promote Coen. Does Solak have some sort of weird influence over Team Glazer? Anyway, Solak seems miffed at Bucs fans if he wants evil to befall them. So Solak openly hopes Coen bolts the Bucs. “Hey, do you have a lot of Bucs fans in your mentions that say they should fire Bowles to promote Coen?” Solak asked Kimes. “I have seen that floating around,” Kimes smiled. “I want so badly for Liam Coen to get hired somewhere else so that Bowles can hire another OC,” Solak said. “Just to see how Bucs fans deal with it. “They are very committed, I feel like, to [Coen’s] future.” That’s sort of an a-hole attitude. You hope a coach bolts a team just so you can watch a fanbase meltdown? Why? Joe never got the impression that Solak is a tool. What, did Bucs AC/DC-loving general manager Jason Licht refuse to hire him at some point? Did Solak bring something unwanted home with him after visiting one of the many clothing-optional establishments on Dale Mabry Highway? Did he get badly sunburned on Clearwater Beach? Does he not like Cuban sandwiches? Joe has no idea why Solak eagerly desires for Bucs fans to wallow in misery — unless Solak wants payback for some reason. Or, is Solak a closet Eagles fan?|2024-12-28 00:00:00|468|48|3|Liam Coen|Bucs fans divided over coaching staff changes.|3|Mixed feelings about Ben Solak's analysis with negative and defensive comments in response.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Mac"", ""post"": ""That is just ignorant on his part!
