https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/all-in-for-the-long-haul/|All-In …For The Long Haul|Joe is in win-now mode when it comes to the Bucs. The Bucs’ brass is in win-now and win-later mode simultaneously. Buccaneers Ring of Honor general manager Jason Licht will not sacrifice the future because he believes the foundation for a very bright one already is in place. And who could argue with Licht on that point? The Bucs’ trenches are damn good and they’ve got a franchise quarterback in his prime with other high-quality talent on the roster. The lasting contenders of the NFL know how to build a roster for the present at the future. However, Joe still paces the halls of JoeBucsFan world headquarters yearning for Licht to make a couple of bold moves to improve in free agency next week. Joe can’t shake it. The Bucs won the NFC South by two games last season and lots of Bucs fans were still annoyed. That speaks to how high the bar is set for this team and how good it could be with a few more additions. (Yeah, Joe is one of those guys who thinks Tampa fans, collectively, are rather savvy.) Joe understands wanting to be a playoff team every year. It’s been a glorious five-year run that Joe appreciates daily, but that big prize in February is still the ultimate goal. It’s ok to take bold chances. Fans would back one or two bold Licht moves and, frankly, the NFL is and always has been an entertainment business. That never should be forgotten by the folks at One Buc Palace. Lavonte David might not have a 2026 season in his body. Mike Evans has 11 years of mileage on his legs. Tristan Wirfs and Antoine Winfield are six-year veterans. Baker Mayfield rightfully will want a fortune of money come 2027. It sure feels like this is a year to get bold in March and stay smart in April. Joe trusts Licht to recover brilliantly from a potential salary cap crater. He’s done it before. The free agency siren goes off Monday at noon. |2025-03-08 19:03:00|338|33|9|Joe|Bucs aim for bold moves to secure championship potential.|5|Various opinions on offseason moves, some optimistic, some cautious, and some critical.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Obvious"", ""post"": ""We should def make a couple of moves on defense.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/with-lavonte-david-signed-now-what/|With Lavonte David Signed, Now What?|The Bucs are still thin at linebacker. Oh, trust that Joe was fully geeked last night when news moved that Lavonte David was brought back from the brink of retirement. Joe poured some Bulleit Bourbon for the occasion (Joe hasn’t yet replenished his supply of Eagle Rare, unfortunately). Still, like last year, the Bucs are dangerously thin at inside linebacker. Now Joe clearly recalls Todd Bowles raving about SirVocea Dennis for the 2025 season. There is a lot to like about Dennis — when he gets on the field. Dennis, 25, has proven in his two Bucs seasons that he can make splash plays and get hurt. Dennis is quick and smart and Joe has a lot of hope for him. But it doesn’t matter if you are Lawrence Taylor II if you cannot stay out of the tub. So if the Bucs are banking on Dennis, well, that’s a gamble to be polite. Joe would lean to draft Alabama linebacker Jihaad Campbell. That way the Bucs get a stud and get younger at a critical position. Campbell is 21. Over at the PFF tribe, Bradley Locker is of the mind the Bucs need to bring in an experienced linebacker. So he thinks Bucs AC/DC-loving general manager Jason Licht should buy 49ers free agent linebacker/damaged goods Dre Greenlaw. … Although he missed virtually all of 2024 due to a torn Achilles, Greenlaw was a stud in the two years prior. The Buccaneers could use coverage help at linebacker. Greenlaw’s market will be interesting because of his injury history, but he’ll have a real shot of playing at a premier level if he stays healthy. Todd Bowles would love his services over the middle. Well, Greenlaw will turn 28 soon. And he’s coming off an Achilles. Joe has three words about that: No freaking way. Joe doesn’t want any older player who needs to rely on speed coming off an Achilles. Greenlaw may not even be 100 percent until 2026. If he’s ever at 100 percent again. An Achilles ruined O.J. Howard’s career. It basically ended Shaq Barrett’s career. The only way Joe would sign Greenlaw is if it’s a dirt-cheap, prove-it contract. Joe would draft this Campbell in a heartbeat before signing Greenlaw. Yes, the Bucs need another inside linebacker. But with David back, they don’t need one so badly they should invest in damaged goods.|2025-03-08 08:40:00|396|51|3|Lavonte David|Bucs thin at linebacker|7|Mixed sentiment with optimism about potential signings but concerns about depth and strategy.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Beeej"", ""post"": ""What\u2019s the consensus on JJ Russell?

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/geno-smith-contract-is-one-to-watch-for-baker-mayfield/|Geno Smith Contract Is One To Watch For Baker Mayfield|Joe saw the Seahawks trade of starting quarterback Geno Smith to the Raiders yesterday and had three initial thoughts. The first was Tom Brady’s performance as an executive in Vegas might look a lot his time as Bucs offensive coordinator in 2022. Second, Joe had a moment of silence for Raiders GM John Spytek, the former Bucs assistant GM. Joe has seen reports that Smith is expecting a new contract in the $40 to $45 million range. Does anyone think Spytek was coveting Smith? The Raiders coughed up a third-round pick. Third, Joe wondered how Baker Mayfield will react when Smith, who is 4 1/2 years older than Mayfield, gets a fatter contract than he has. After two consecutive postseason and Pro Bowl trips, Mayfield will earn $30 million this season after earning about $40 million combined the past two seasons. Remember, Mayfield was often compared to Smith because of their comeback stories and tie to former Bucs and Seahawks assistant coach Dave Canales. More important, Mayfield is a much better quarterback than Smith. Mayfield turns 30 next month and is in his prime, and he’s a clear top-10 NFL quarterback earning nowhere near his value. How long will that last? Will Mayfield quietly play out the final two years of his relatively inexpensive Bucs contract (2025 & 2026) or will he turn into a business man sooner than the Bucs expect? This is another reason Joe wants the Bucs to be in win-now mode as free agency begins. Lavonte David Is Back!

It really is pitiful that you people that don\u2019t like Baker no longer have much of anything to complain about so you have to latch on to anything, like he chokes. I really hate to tell you but when a quarterback has a passer rating of 146.5 like Baker did in the game in question you just say thank you Baker you are amazing under pressure in the big games. But not the haters. Then there is the 83.3% completion percentage in the same game. That\u2019s almost 20% better than mahomes did in the playoffs and 45% better than mahomes in the playoffs passer rating. But Bakers a choker. You haters are something else.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/the-slander-of-lavonte-david/|The Slander Of Lavonte David|Two things quickly get Joe fully frosted when it comes to the Bucs. The first is edge rush. Seeing so many proven edge rushers become available the past couple of days has Joe staring at a computer screen continually pounding a fist the way you’d expect after Joe stares at the S&P 500 ticker monitoring Joe’s Tesla stock the past two weeks. Or the way Joe hammers his desk when the pizza delivery guy is running late. The other is the slander of Lavonte David. It is just criminal how David has been screwed by the haughty, learned NFL types who give out Pro Bowl gifts. David could have 200 tackles in a season and people wouldn’t vote the guy into the Pro Bowl. It just drives Joe up a tree. “Aw, com’on Joe, the Pro Bowl sucks! No one cares! It doesn’t mean a damn thing!” Oh, really? Then why do teams give out bonuses to players who make the Pro Bowl? Why are Pro Bowl appearances regularly used as criteria to get into the Pro Football Hall of Fame? Don’t give Joe this nonsense the Pro Bowl is meaningless. Now when some folks talk about linebackers and the Hall of Fame, Joe has actually heard chatter linking Washington linebacker Bobby Wagner as a Hall of Fame candidate. Joe agrees. He’s been a strong linebacker for a long time and has a Super Bowl ring. David? Well, Pro Football Hall of Fame selector Ira Kaufman always cautions Bucs fans that David may not have “the hardware,” meaning David may not have enough All-Pro awards or Pro Bowl appearances to sway enough voters. Don’t blame Ira. He’s just the messenger. So you look at these stats dug up by Bucs fan Trevor Allen (@tdbucs2002). If this doesn’t make you want to hit the ceiling, Joe doesn’t know what to say.  Hell, David’s stats are damn near identical to Wagner’s yet David may never sniff the Hall of Fame, but Wagner might because of the GD Pro Bowl??? Outrageous! All Joe hears from defensive coaches is constant prattle and droning about the importance of takeaways. David’s takeaways blow away Wagner’s. But, nope, can’t have David in the Pro Bowl. He doesn’t have the hardware to get in to the Hall of Fame. What a bunch of crap! It is shameful beyond words how David has been shat on for no other reason than he plays in Tampa Bay and not in the NFC East, the AFC North or the NFC North. Can you imagine how the NFL community would fall to its knees for David if he played in one of the aforementioned divisions? There would be a bridge named after him. But David’s been punished for playing for a garbage team for half his career and being buried in the NFC South, which is virtually ignored by BSPN and the league’s house organ, NFL Network. Just a complete shame — and sham — man! Lavonte David Is Back! Ira Kaufman Talks Free Agency, Trey Hendrickson Versus Florence Henderson, Jamel Dean’s Shaky Ground & More.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/lavonte-david-signing-should-tilt-bucs-pick-at-no-19/|Lavonte David Signing Should Tilt Bucs’ Pick At No. 19|Joe has stated if one of the following three players are chosen by Bucs AC/DC-loving general manager Jason Licht with the No. 19 pick in the draft next month, then Joe will sleep well. And not necessarily in this order of importance: * Mike Green — He’s the beastly defensive end from Marshall who racked up 17 sacks last year to lead the nation, and blew up projected first-round picks trying to block him during the Senior Bowl practices. And if a guy blows up in Senior Bowl practices, he always catches the eye of Licht. * Emeka Egbuka — the Chris Godwin clone from the national champions, The Ohio State University. This guy is exactly like Godwin. He gets off on blocking like most receivers get off on Mossing defenders. He plays the inside, he plays the outside, he runs tough (yes, runs) and you never heard him chirp when freshman prodigy Jeremiah Smith came in and took over as the Buckeyes’ No. 1 receiver. Godwin may not even be back with the Bucs. Mike Evans will be 32. The Bucs may not need a receiver now, but that time is right around the corner. In the wake of the Bucs re-signing franchise icon Lavonte David yesterday, a third player has edged into Joe’s top spot as a primary focus. * Jihaad Campbell. This guy can do it all. He is a beast against the run. He can rush the passer. And he can cover. Joe loves, loves, loves the idea of the Alabama linebacker Campbell coming in and learning at the foot of David. There may not be a smarter linebacker in the game than David. Putting Campbell next to David would not only help the rookie on the field, but David’s knowledge of the game would also be the ticket to help a Nick Saban linebacker transition to the NFL. Again, Joe wouldn’t lose a wink of sleep if the Bucs pick Egbuka or Green. But it seems the smart play here could be to bring Campbell on board.
