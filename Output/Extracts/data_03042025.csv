https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/john-spytek-talks-bucs-offensive-line/|John Spytek Talks Bucs’ Offensive Line|So 2024 Bucs assistant GM John Spytek now is in Las Vegas as an underboss to Tom Brady, but he still likes to talk about his Tampa Bay experience. Joining PFT Live last week, Spytek was asked about offensive line building. He wasn’t asked about the Bucs’ offensive line, but that’s where he went. “We kind of established a mentality in those guys and a character that made them a cohesive group,” Spytek said of the Bucs’ line. “I mean, that [Bucs offensive line] in Tampa last year was a group of really special people and players and, you know, we kind of had some non-negotiables of what we were looking for, both character and really physical traits. And we kind of just stuck to those things and, you know, we grew a good group together. The continuity they had and their durability in particular, like those guys played a lot of games together. That working mentality was awesome. Just the like-mindedness of it, those guys hung out all the time.” Spytek also stressed that he believes the strength of the Bucs through the past six seasons has been the O-line. He also gave Buccaneers Ring of Honor general manager credit for believing in small-school tackles and their ability to move inside effectively in the NFL. The list is long, and it includes retired center Ryan Jensen. In the case of Luke Goedeke, he moved inside then back outside and has thrived. Frankly, Joe thinks Goedeke could be a good guard, too. Regardless, all this Spytek chatter means little to Joe other than it’s more evidence that the team wants to re-sign pending free agent left guard Ben Bredeson.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/one-less-destination-for-ben-bredeson/|One Less Destination For Ben Bredeson|Will the Bucs keep their starting left guard? That’s more likely after today’s happenings. ESPN reported today that the Bears are trading a sixth-round pick for Rams big-money left guard Jonah Jackson. That sent cheers through the halls of JoeBucsFan.com world headquarters. Joe thought the Bears might target Bucs pending free agent Ben Bredeson, Tampa Bay’s 27 year old starting left guard. So now there’s one less team potentially chasing Bredeson, and the free agent guard class is deep. Joe’s had questions about the Bengals releasing former Bucs guard Alex Cappa yesterday. Cappa was a Bucs third-round pick in 2018 and had a nice career. Heck, he even turned down The Goat three years ago and bolted to Cincinnati for strong money. No, Joe doesn’t believe the Bucs are interested in Cappa. Bredeson is their first choice, but Joe suspects serious Bucs fans from Mulberry to Madeira Beach know Buccaneers Ring of Honor general manager Jason Licht is not going to drop stupid money on Bredeson. He’s too replaceable for that. And that’s a nod to Licht, not a knock on Bredeson.|2025-03-04 17:01:00|182|29|7|Ben Bredeson|Bucs likely to keep starting left guard|2|Mixed sentiments with criticism, uncertainty, and some positive outlook on team dynamics.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Defense Rules"", ""post"": ""Hopefully the Bucs re-sign thei key UFAs before free agency starts.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/monitoring-azeez-ojulari/|Monitoring Azeez Ojulari|Bucs AC/DC-loving general manager Jason Licht sure preferred to shop for an edge rusher at the Dollar Store bargain bin in past years rather than at Urban Outfitters. And when you’re trying to find a lost gem at such an important position, you often get what you pay for. Licht did once find Bucs sacks king Shaq Barrett at Dollar Store. Can Licht repeat that? One guy Joe had his eye on since last year is Giants outside linebacker Azeez Ojulari. No, he’s not Jason Pierre-Paul, but maybe, just maybe, he could be another Shaq. Ojulari, 24, last year had his second-highest sack total (six sacks) since his rookie season when he had eight. What’s important to factor is that Ojulari only played 11 games last year. So Ojulari averaged just over a sack every two games. Extend that out to 17 games and he’d have eight sacks. Not double-digits, but it’s not Joe Tryon-Shoyinka numbers, either. The problem with this Ojulari is that he’s brittle, so he may come at a nice discount. Ojulari hasn’t played a full season since his rookie year in 2021. Is Ojulari the answer for an edge rusher? Unlikely, just based on availability alone. Would he be a great guy coming off the bench or being a spot starter? Probably. Even if the Bucs signed Ojulari in free agency next wee, they still need a reliable, proven and productive edge rusher.|2025-03-04 10:30:00|237|31|4|Azeez Ojulari|Edge rusher search analysis and prospects for Bucs football team.|3|Mixed opinions on Brittle players, depth needs, focus on defense in draft.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Lol"", ""post"": ""Only as a depth piece.

Bucs outside cornerback Zyon McCollum is young, explosive and inexpensive. His counterpart, Dean, is turning 29 with steady visits to the Bucs’ medical team, and sporting a massive contract. Loads of Bucs fans want Dean to move on or cut his paycheck. And it seems retired six-time Pro Bowl Bucs defensive tackle Gerald McCoy is in that pirate ship. Yesterday on X, McCoy was asking Buccaneers Ring of Honor general manager Jason Licht to look closely at the news of Eagles starting cornerback Darius Slay getting released. Joe gets the Slay interest, but man, just the thought of the Bucs signing Slay for quality cash before or instead of landing a stud edge rusher sends Joe to the toilet to release bodily fluids.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/khalil-mack-can-heat-up-the-pocket/|Khalil Mack “Can Heat Up The Pocket”|Joe hasn’t slept since the report connecting the Bucs and pending free agent edge rusher Khalil Mack. What an upgrade that would be! Will 34-year-old Mack, a likely Hall of Famer after nine Pro Bowl trips and three first-team All-Pro selections, move on from the Chargers. That seems to be the buzz across the NFL. Joe’s been digging in on film of Mack, who looks a hell of a lot better than Joe Tryon-Shoyinka, José Ramirez and every other Bucs edge rusher not named Diaby. Here’s what former NFL safety turned BSPN analyst Matt Bowen wrote about Diaby about six weeks ago. “Mack’s game has aged gracefully after 11 pro seasons. He had six sacks and 41 pressures this season, and he can heat up the pocket. With 107.5 career sacks and steady play speed, Mack is still a three-down force based on the tape.” In the same January story, Jeremy Fowler, who pumped out Sunday’s news that the Bucs are likely on Mack’s scent, wrote of Mack: “The sense is Los Angeles will make efforts to re-sign Mack, who will play in 2025 after he said he needed to take time to mull his future following the season. The Chargers believe he embodies the spirit of the team’s toughness. … … ” Does this sound like a pass rusher who has lost his game? Joe’s all-in on Mack on a reasonable one-year contract. He should be hungry to play with Vita Vea and Calijah Kancey, and across from YaYa Diaby — and against division opponents with questionable offensive line play. And maybe Mack even wants to come home to his native Florida. The free agency siren goes off in six short days.|2025-03-04 07:33:00|283|26|7|Khalil Mack|Potential move to the Buccaneers excites fans and analysts.|4|Mixed sentiments about signing Mack, with concerns about age and potential impact.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Statguy"", ""post"": ""Initially I rolled my eyes but I didn\u2019t realize he had 17 sacks in 2023"", ""post_time"": [""March"", ""4th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""7:49"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Oneilbuc"", ""post"": ""Man he\u2019s washed up why do the bucs love these washed up players so much?"", ""post_time"": [""March"", ""4th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""7:56"", ""am""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""Permanently Moderated"", ""post"": ""I don\u2019t believe he will be signed by the Bucs.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/were-picking-the-right-guys/|“We’re Picking The Right Guys”|Few head coaches have had two first-time NFL playcallers get plucked back-to-back like what happened with the Bucs the past two offseasons. After Dave Canales led Baker Mayfield to a career year in 2023, he was hired to run the Stinking Panthers. Last season, Mayfield again had a career year, this time with Liam Coen. Then days later Coen was off to Jacksonville. Bowles was asked at the combine in downtown Indianapolis last week for his comment on going on his fourth offensive coordinator in as many seasons. “No. 1, it taught me I don’t get a vacation,” Bowles said. “But the biggest thing is that at least we know we’re picking the right guys.” But as Bowles pointed out, Josh Grizzard, his fourth offensive coordinator in as many seasons, shouldn’t be a jolt to the offense. While Canales and Coen came from the outside, and in Canales’ case his offense was a radical departure from ill-suited Byron Leftwich’s, going from Coen to Grizzard won’t be a radical departure. Grizzard was Coen’s right-hand man. “Obviously, there will be some different things, but you try to pick the right guys,” Bowles explained. “It’s not the right guys depending on how smart or good they are, it’s about the right guy [for] how your team is built and how you think your guys can get the most out of what they’re coaching. “We try to do a good job picking that and making sure we’ve got the right guy that way. We think ‘Grizz’ is that guy.” It will be interesting to see how much Grizzard deviates from Coen, if at all. When he was introduced, Grizzard said he wants to throw downfield more than Coen. No, Coen didn’t go deep much and when Joe would point that out, it seemed to irk Coen. Joe wasn’t trying to get under his skin, it was just an observation. Hell, the Bucs offense was humming without the long ball. Why fix something that wasn’t broken? Now, can Grizzard keep the Bucs offense in the top-three like it finished last season?

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/did-jason-licht-tip-his-hand-where-he-is-leaning-in-the-draft/|Did Jason Licht Tip His Draft Hand?|Yeah, Joe gets it. No need to consult with a NASA rocket scientist or a Ouija board to figure out the Bucs will draft for defense because there is really no hole on offense. There are holes on defense at each level. Maybe because even dudes walking around with white canes can see the Bucs have to address defense is why Bucs AC/DC-loving general manager Jason Licht seemed to show his hand to the assembled NFL media when Licht was at the podium in the Indiana Convention Center in Indianapolis last week at the combine. He said it appears the NFC South is on the cusp of being a quarterback division again. Licht was asked if the NFC South is starting to creep back to the days when it had Tom Brady, Matty Ice and Drew Brees because of the way Baker Mayfield, Bryce Young and Michael Penix showed out last season. “We’ve been talking about this a lot,” Licht said. “In Carolina, Bryce Young really came on [in 2024] and showed why he was such a coveted pick. “We think [Michael] Penix is a really good quarterback, a dynamic quarterback. He’s got a really good arm and is a smart guy. “It’s keeping everybody on their edge. We have to continue to not just remain competitive but try to stay ahead.” So how do you stay ahead? Well, the Bucs have their quarterback, Mayfield. So that is solved. But the Bucs are going to have to stay ahead by having a defense that can neutralize Penix and Young. To Joe, that was Licht all but promising the team needs to load up on defense this offseason.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/pff-the-ideal-bucs-offseason/|PFF: The “Ideal” Bucs Offseason|Joe truly, honestly believes the Bucs are maybe two solid defensive players away from making a serious Super Bowl run. The Bucs have the offense, especially if Chris Godwin returns. It’s the defense that needs help. Provided Lavonte David returns, the Bucs have two, maybe three holes (it seems as if the Bucs are banking on SirVocea Dennis to be a starter). Those two positions would be corner and, all together now, edge rusher. Put a strong edge rusher on this team to go along with Vita Vea, Calijah Kancey and YaYa Diaby and you’re cooking with gas. In fact, Thomas Valentine of the PFF tribe seems to think the “ideal” move for the Bucs is to draft an edge rusher at No. 19. Look, if the Bucs draft Marshall’s Mike Green at No. 19, Joe wouldn’t cry. But Joe wouldn’t do that. Here’s why: Rarely do rookie edge rushers make an impact. Certainly, it’s unreasonable to draft a guy in the bottom half of the first round and expect him to be Simeon Rice right off the bat. That’s not fair. Mike Evans (his contract is up after 2026) and Lavonte David may be in their final seasons with the Bucs. That would be two massive holes in the roster to fill for 2026. “This Joe” has a hard time seeing, short of the Bucs getting two Hall of Fame players to replace Evans and David, how the Bucs could be a better team in 2026 than 2025. So it is imperative to bring in a legitimate, serious edge rusher this fall. No monkeying around drowning a couple of guys on the level of Robert Ayers or Randy Gregory in gallons of the cologne “Hope.” The Bucs need a dangerous edge rusher now.
