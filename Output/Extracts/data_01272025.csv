https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/run-defense-and-the-2025-offseason/|Run Defense And The 2025 Offseason|Joe heard an insightful comment made by a departed Bucs coach. No, not El Serpiente, Liam Coen, who did his first Jaguars news conference today as head coach. Joe is referring to the new Lions defensive line coach, Kacy Rodgers, who coached up Bucs defensive linemen from 2019 through this season. Rodgers sat down with the Buccaneers Radio Network before he left for the white sands and comfortable winters of Detroit. He noted how the Bucs’ run defense was stout overall this season and hung tough while facing the NFL’s great rushing teams. “You didn’t play the little sisters of the blind,” Rodgers said. Yes, the Bucs faced the Eagles and Lions, powerful run-heavy teams (among other tough rushing clubs). The Bucs did just enough to slow Eagles star Saquon Barkley and electric Lions running back Jahmyr Gibbs to prevent them from having standout days — and the Bucs won each game. Outside of a 59-yard touchdown run in the third quarter, Barkley was quiet as the Bucs won 33-16 in September. Rodgers noted how again the Bucs will face a first-place schedule after winning the NFC South. That means 2025 dates with the Lions and Eagles, along with the Bills, 49ers, Rams and Falcons, teams that chew up yards on the ground. Joe is going here because that schedule very much could affect the Bucs’ offseason approach. Yeah, the Bucs are building for the future, but they’re very much in win-now mode and Todd Bowles is sure to be a little extra obsessed with stopping the run. Sorry, Joe can’t bet a nickel the Bucs will be obsessed with securing a beastly edge rusher. Maybe, if he can stop the run.|2025-01-27 16:53:00|282|38|7|Joe|Bucs run defense focus facing tough rushing teams in 2025.|4|Mix of frustration and hope for improvement in various areas related to team performance.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Lol"", ""post"": ""Outside of the 59- yard run by Saquan.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/derek-barnett-the-bucs/|Derek Barnett & The Bucs|So the Bucs, unless their front office has a sadistic streak, will let Joe Tryon-Shoyinka walk in free agency and try to find someone more worthy of the 539 defensive snaps JTS enjoyed last season. The Bucs’ 2021 first-round pick, in regular-season play, has averaged 1 sack for every 168 snaps. That’s brutal for an edge rusher. Heck, Anthony Nelson, often Tryon-Shoyinka’s backup for the past four seasons, has been a far more prolific pass rusher. Through those same four seasons, Nelson averaged 1 sack for every 112 snaps, and at times he came off the field on passing downs. This brings Joe to Tryon-Shoyinka’s 2025 replacement. Will the Bucs invest big money in free agency on an edge rusher? History says that’s highly unlikely. So Joe’s exploring the second and lower tier potential free agents, guys that could compete with 2024 draft pick Chris Braswell, who the Bucs certainly hope/pray becomes a legit pass rusher. Veteran edge rusher Derek Barnett, who turns 29 in June, might be on Tampa Bay’s radar. After five seasons on an often loaded Eagles defensive line, Barnett blew out his knee (ACL) on opening day of the 2022 season. He came back in 2023 but rode the bench and was cut in midseason. The Texans picked him up and re-signed him for 2024 on a one-year contract for $2 million plus incentives. Barnett finished this season healthy as a rotational pass rusher with 5 sacks in only 390 snaps. He also was responsible for one of the most unique plays of the NFL season. In the video below, you’ll see Barnett get a strip-sack of Cowboys quarterback Cooper Rush and after the Cowboys recover the ball, Barnett picks up a second Cowboys fumble and rumbles for a touchdown. Joe doesn’t know what Barnett might command in free agency, but it won’t be a ton. He’s got an Eagles Super Bowl ring and maybe, just maybe, Barnett is now fully past the blown ACL and ready to return to the standout player he was early in his career.|2025-01-27 09:15:00|343|51|3|Derek Barnett|Bucs consider edge rusher prospects for upcoming season.|3|Mixed sentiment with skepticism toward coaching and player development, hope for team improvement.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""JimBobBuc"", ""post"": ""With Bowles\u2019 inability to draft and develop an edge rusher, a trade or FA pickup will be needed.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/really-really-cool-background-on-what-nate-scheelhaase-does-with-rams/|Really, Really Cool Background On Nate Scheelhaase’s Role With The Rams|One of the first names that popped as a Bucs offensive coordinator candidate was former Illinois quarterback, Iowa State offensive coordinator and Rams offensive assistant Nate Scheelhaase. And after seeing a video produced by the Rams of what Scheelhaase does, and factoring in what Scheelhaase did at Iowa State, Joe is sold. Basically, Scheelhaase gets intel from Rams guru Sean McVay on what he wants in an offensive gameplan. Then, on Tuesday nights, Scheelhaase builds the gameplan that players work on when they arrive in the building on Wednesday mornings. So Scheelhaase quite literally makes McVay’s weekly offensive vision come alive each week. In other words, Scheelhaase has learned how McVay’s mind works. Three guys who held the very same responsibility for McVay in previous years are either now head coaches or NFL offensive coordinators. That would be Zac Taylor with the Bengals, Liam Coen with the Jags and Zac Robinson with the Dixie Chicks. While the book may still be out on Robinson, Taylor sure knows what he is doing on offense with the Bengals. Coen’s resume needs no explanation on this here website. So next in line for a McVay disciple to be an offensive coordinator very well could be Scheelhaase, who is only 34 years old. While at Iowa State, Scheelhaase displayed a knack for developing guys as a position coach and as an offensive coordinator. Scheelhaase had receiver Xavier Hutchinson (Houston) and running backs David Montgomery (Lions) and Breece Hall (Jets) while serving as a wide receivers coach and later running backs coach. In his one year as an offensive coordinator, Scheelhaase molded then-freshman quarterback Rocco Becht (son of former Bucs tight end Anthony Becht) into the Big XII Freshman of the Year. Given Scheelhaase’s demonstrated ability to develop and his background learning from the master, McVay, Scheelhaase is already Joe’s favorite Bucs offensive coordinator candidate. Unless Joe’s pipe dream of Lincoln Riley comes true. https://twitter.com/JFowlerESPN/status/1883590400902090974  |2025-01-27 07:55:00|320|61|8|Nate Scheelhaase|Potential Bucs offensive coordinator excels under McVay's mentorship.|6|Mixed opinions on potential OC hire, uncertainty about impact, and current coaching staff effectiveness.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""SB~LV"", ""post"": ""Yes\u2026 impressive football mind"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""27th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""7:57"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Bucsfan"", ""post"": ""Agree-Hire Nate."", ""post_time"": [""Bucsfan""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""Xristos"", ""post"": ""We didnt know what Canales offense will look like.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/it-was-personal-for-shad-khan/|It Was Personal For Shad Khan|So the guy ahead of the curve on all the Liam Coen reporting was Jaguars radio play-by-play man Frank Frangie. Joe shared plenty of his public reports here before the Coen drama exploded. Frangie works for the team and cleary is in touch with the high levels of the organization. He also is the longtime afternoon drive radio host on Jacksonville sports radio. On Friday, Frangie emphasized that Jaguars owner Shad Khan took over pursuit over the former Buccaneers offensive coordinator and made it personal. Khan was hungry for his new head coach. There were no handlers in between, per Frangie. It was Khan talking to the Coen team and sending him a plane to fly to Jacksonville on Thursday. Frangie added that Coen so incredibly “crushed” the first 45 minutes of his 3 1/2-hour second interview with the Jaguars, it drove Khan to drive up by millions how much he would pay Coen. “Shad wasn’t going to let him leave [Jacksonville] without being the next head coach,” Frangie said on 92.5 FM. “I can tell you it was Shad that got him to get on that plane. It was Shad that sent the plane. It was Shad that ran the interview. It was Shad that looked him in the eye.” Per Frangie, Coen doesn’t deserve the hate he’s getting from Bucs fans because it was the Bucs that drove Coen into acting secretly and hiding his intent to keep pursuing the Jaguars job.. Frangie said Coen’s pending but unsigned new Bucs contract said he couldn’t take a second interview with the Jaguars, so Coen was put in an impossible position: in one corner was Khan seemingly eager to hand him a tens of millions of dollars guaranteed and a dream job, and in the other corner was the Bucs’ offering him a deal contingent on not talking to Khan. The last-minute nature of everything threw tremendous stress into the situation, per Frangie, after Coen told Jacksonville he was finished with them very early on Wednesday. Joe’s just presenting the other side here. Joe sees zero reason why Coen couldn’t have acted more professionally with the Bucs — as they did with him. He still chose the wrong way to slither out of town.|2025-01-27 07:35:00|374|74|5|Shad Khan|Personal pursuit for new head coach causes controversy.|3|Mixed feelings with more negativity.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Bucsfan"", ""post"": ""Shame we do not play El Serpiente next year."", ""post_time"": [""Bucsfan""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""BuccaDAWG"", ""post"": ""Don\u2019t let the door know hit you where the Good Lord split you, you spineless , low class pice of crap.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/team-glazer-and-liam-coen/|Team Glazer And Liam Coen|There are all sorts of interesting reports about how Bucs offensive coordinator Liam Coen went from preparing for the combine to 72 hours later being named the new coach of the Jaguars. Over at ESPN, Jenna Laine and Michael DiRocco go deep into the crazy week that was for the Bucs, the Jags, Liam Coen and others in what the ESPN duo described as a trail of chaos, which was basically scorched earth between Temple Terrace and Middleburg. One thing that jumped out to Joe is an alleged order from Team Glazer to Bucs AC/DC-loving general manager Jason Licht when Team Glazer wanted a response from Coen. When the Bucs received the [Jags’] interview request, general manager Jason Licht asked Coen, “What’s your number?” meaning how much would it take to keep him, a team source told ESPN’s Dan Graziano. Coen came back with a number: between $4 million to $5 million per year, which would have made him the highest-paid coordinator in the league, according to multiple sources. Bucs ownership agreed to the number — contingent upon him not taking the in-person interview in Jacksonville. But a Bucs source told ESPN that even if Coen had signed the contract, they couldn’t have technically prevented him from going to the interview. Ownership wanted Licht to get a decision from Coen by Tuesday night, team sources told ESPN. What Joe wants to know is, if Coen didn’t come back with an answer by Tuesday night. Would Team Glazer had told Licht to tell Coen, “We loved having you, but we’re moving on?” That would have been a hilarious move given what transpired two days later when Coen allegedly tried to shake down Team Glazer and then ghosted them. Joe’s guess is, if Team Glazer, by way of Licht, didn’t get an answer by Tuesday night, the offer of some $4.5 million a year for Coen (a $3 million raise?) would have been pulled. Still, it’s intriguing to wonder what was on Team Glazer’s mind at the time.|2025-01-27 07:00:00|336|50|6|Team Glazer And Liam Coen|Coen's chaotic negotiations with Buccaneers ownership and potential move to Jaguars.|2|Mixed feelings and frustrations expressed regarding Coen's departure and the Bucs management's actions.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Durango 95"", ""post"": ""\u201cWhen the Bucs received the [Jags\u2019] interview request,\u2026.\u201d \u2014\u2014"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""27th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""7:25"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Tony"", ""post"": ""Why not we can always have faith in the three leprechauns.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/keeping-bucs-assistants-from-fleeing-to-jacksonville/|Keeping Bucs Assistants From Fleeing To Jacksonville|Now that the dust has settled on Liam Coen bolting to Jacksonville, the next order of business for the Bucs is to keep the rest of the offensive coaches on staff. Maybe that’s just as important as finding a new offensive coordinator. One guy the Bucs cannot afford to lose is offensive line coach Kevin Carberry. The guy has done a phenomenal job. That’s a big reason why the Bucs offense hummed this season. Generally, if a guy has a chance for a promotion, teams don’t stand in his way. That’s why Joe is scared that Coen may pluck Carberry from the Bucs by giving him the offensive coordinator title with the Jags. Sure, that’s an empty title because Carberry wouldn’t call plays. It would sort of be like what Chucky did with Bill Muir. Chucky called the plays. In reality, Muir was just the offensive line coach. But with the title of “offensive coordinator” Muir wasn’t going anywhere. Of course, the Bucs could slap Carberry with the title of “associate head coach,” give him a pay raise for the hassle and be done with it. Well, Jonathan Jones of CBS is of the mind Bucs fans won’t have to worry about that. He believes the Bucs, still sore how things shook down last week between the Jags and Coen, aren’t about to let any other assistant go to the Jags in the coming days unless Coen hires someone as a coordinator. The best way to save Carberry is to give him some highfalutin title (with a nice raise). It’s not like Carberry didn’t earn a raise. He did a helluva job.|2025-01-27 03:45:00|272|26|6|Bucs Assistants|Bucs aim to keep offensive coaches from leaving to Jacksonville.|2|Mixed feelings about coaching changes, with some disappointment and skepticism expressed in comments.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""garro"", ""post"": ""Yup Yup and You freaking nailed it Joe!"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""27th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""4:45"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""FortMyersDave"", ""post"": ""So Liam can steal just one coach as his OC but I do have a question.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/bucky-irving-was-robbed/|Bucky Irving Was Robbed|Joe can’t fully remember the last time a Bucs rookie made such a splash and such an impact as Bucky Irving did. However, when the five finalists were named for the NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year, Bucky wasn’t among them. What the hell? Who were the final finalists? Tight end Brock Bowers of the Raiders, quarterback Jayden Daniels of the Commandos, quarterback Bo Nix of the Broncos receiver Brian Thomas of the Jags and receiver Malik Nabers of the Giants. Bowers, Daniels and Nix are no-brainers in Joe’s mind. Thomas is a strong if not gifted wide receiver. Then Joe comes to Nabers. Is Nabers good? Yeah. But what kind of impact did he have? The Giants lost 14 friggin’ games for crying out loud. How can Nabers be in that final five and not Bucky? Even Tyler Brooke of The 33rd Team seemed miffed by this shunning of Bucky. Do the Bucs even make the playoffs without Bucky? Possibly not. Is Liam Coen still the Bucs’ offensive coordinator without Bucky? Joe thinks that’s a safe bet. Bucky had a major impact. The team was horrible with the run, 32nd last year. With Bucky the Bucs rose to fourth! That is a monumental improvement. How could the catalyst for that not be a finalist for Offensive Rookie of the Year?
