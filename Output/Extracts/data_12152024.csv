How about Mike Evans? He entered Sunday’s matchup needing to average 102.5 yards in the final four games to keep his 1,000-yard streak alive. With 159 yards and two TDs on his nine catches against the Chargers, Evans now needs to average 83.7 yards against the Cowboys, Panthers and Saints to reach 1,000 once again. That’s a far more manageable number for the future Hall of Famer. Then we come to the strange case of Jamel Dean, who caught a Justin Herbert floater. That set off a celebration with teammates who perhaps had no idea that Dean had gone 37 consecutive games without an interception. With those two streaks out of the way, we come to the most important one of all — a four-game run that lifted Tampa Bay to 8-6 and guarantees the Bucs will remain atop the NFC South for at least another week. This 40-17 beatdown was a huge victory, but it wasn’t a shocking upset because the Bucs were only a slight underdog. What WAS shocking was how thoroughly Tampa Bay embarrassed a solid opponent in its own stadium, using a second-half blitz to send Charger fans back to La La Land wondering what they had just witnessed. For the second time this season, both on the road, the Bucs won the second half 27-0, erasing deficits at New Orleans and at Los Angeles. Baker Mayfield shook off a second-quarter pick to throw for four scores, posting a nifty passer rating of 135.3. It marked the seventh time in 14 games that Mayfield has thrown at least three TD passes. His timing with Evans was exquisite and he added a few timely scrambles as well.  Jalen McMillan continued his late-season surge with five catches for 75 yards and a score while a marauding ground game bullied the NFL’s No. 1 scoring defense into submission. Tampa Bay’s second-half defense, led by Lavonte David, suffocated Herbert and sent a fair-weather fan base scurrying for the clogged freeways. Guess what? They had already seen enough wreckage. Special teams joined the fun as Chase McLaughlin kicked four field goals and the Bucs, who have struggled to find a decent punter, didn’t need one. They never punted in 11 possessions. Down and seemingly out at 4-6, trailing Atlanta by essentially three games with only seven games remaining, the Bucs now have the look of a very dangerous team. Behind a nasty, physical offensive line, they have proven they can run the ball effectively on anyone. They overcame a pair of second-quarter giveaways and never flinched. The camaraderie of this young group is inspiring and Todd Bowles deserves credit for never flinching during a midseason tailspin. Is it enough to silence the Bowles skeptics? Maybe not, but the Glazers sign the checks and they have to be impressed with a head coach who has his team playing winning football in December for the second consecutive season. Here’s how the Bucs won the day in convincing style and amped up the pressure on the reeling Falcons, who play tomorrow night at the Raiders: * Mayfield’s interception was poorly thrown amid poor judgment, but he more than made up for the gaffe with a spectacular TD pass to Evans down the left sidelines, Drifting to his left, Mayfield kept his eyes downfield and found Evans unguarded at the Chargers 35. Evans did the rest, bouncing off a defender and going the distance. Mayfield’s second scoring strike to Evans was one of his best throws of the season. * An embattled defense is showing its pride and poise. During the 4-game winning streak, Tampa Bay has allowed only six touchdowns. On Sunday, the Chargers went 0-for-6 on third down and finished with 206 yards. Herbert was dropped three times and took a beating all afternoon before Jim Harbaugh mercifully pulled him. * David was all over the field with 12 tackles, 1 1/2 sacks and three QB hits. If David wants to play in 2025, there’s no way the Bucs won’t bring him back. He’s far too valuable — on and off the field. * Rookie center Graham Barton is struggling a bit but the rest of the O-line has been stellar. Joey Bosa and Khalil Mack just combined for three tackles and ZERO QB hits. Next up, Micah Parsons, who led a Dallas pass rush rush that just terrorized Bryce Young. * Kudos to Bucky Irving, who shook off back and hip soreness to gouge the Chargers for 117 yards. Yes, the rookie seems to break off a long run in every game when he’s healthy. Rachaad White is also playing well in a Liam Coen offense that just rolled up 298 yards in the second half alone. * Tykee Smith has a bright future, but he has missed some critical tackles on wide receivers this season, resulting in scores. He’ll need to clean up his technique the rest of the way. * The Bucs averaged 7.6 yards on their 67 snaps against the Chargers. That’s a big number and Mayfield led the way by averaging almost 11 yards on his 27 pass attempts. * Every Buc player got into the game and you’d be hard-pressed to find someone who didn’t contribute to a lopsided victory. Even Logan Hall came up big with 1 1/2 sacks. * Even eight penalties for 83 yards couldn’t slow down this express train. It was the worst home setback for the Chargers since a 38-10 loss to the Jaguars in Week 3 of the 2022 season. * Harbaugh appeared stunned during a brief appearance at the post-game podium. He didn’t quite know what to say, so he kept things simple. “We didn’t play well enough and we didn’t coach well enough,” he said. “It was pretty thorough … very thorough.” Down the hall, the Bucs were proud of their effort, their character and their focus. Somewhere on their flight home, perhaps deep in the heart of Texas, players and coaches toasted to a job well done. Buc Nation likely did the same. |2024-12-15 22:33:00|1017|27|7|Ira Kaufman|Bucs dominate Chargers|6|Mixed sentiment, with positive comments on performance but some concerns and critical remarks.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Oxycondomns"", ""post"": ""you forgot about the human victory cigar kyle trask"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""15th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""10:42"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""EA"", ""post"": ""Best team in NFC, that\u2019s right I said it."", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""15th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""10:58"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""Joseph C Simmons"", ""post"": ""It\u2019s been mentioned before but I still don\u2019t think it\u2019s mentioned enough: Bowles is terrific at defensive halftime adjustments.

David is, if you can believe it, a former Big Ten player just like Chargers coach Jim Harbaugh. Nebraska has been in the B1G that long. And like Harbaugh, David played for a coach who preached toughness, defense and running the ball too. So when the Bucs prepared for the Chargers, David said the Bucs wanted to show Harbaugh and the NFL that the Chargers weren’t the only team that could play Battlebots football. “We pride ourselves on being tough as well,” David told Joe after the game. “We let them know what type of game it would be.” The Bucs sure did. It wasn’t just smashmouth, old school, 1960s football. The Bucs, on timely plays, opened the game up. Most notably they finally unleashed their future Hall of Fame receiver Mike Evans, who responded with two touchdown catches and 159 yards receiving. The game-changing play was from the unexpected sure hands of corner Jamel Dean. With the Bucs up by a touchdown, it was Dean’s pick that set up an Evans touchdown late in the third quarter. It was Dean’s first pick since September 2022. “It was big,” David said of Dean’s pick. “We have to take the ball away. That’s why we dialed up the pressure. We were able to get pressure on the quarterback. “We received that gift. They hadn’t thrown any interceptions since Week 2. Momentum was on our side. It was huge.” David had a typical Lavonte David game: 12 tackles, a tackle for loss, 1.5 sacks and three quarterback hits. Ho, hum.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/tristan-wirfs-bucs-ran-to-move-the-chains-and-ended-up-winning/|Tristan Wirfs: Bucs Ran To Move The Chains And Ended Up Winning|As Joe noted, Chargers coach Jim Harbaugh likes to build a team the way his old Michigan coach Bo Schembechler built them: Tough, physical, scary defense and pounding the football on the ground. The Bucs today showed Harbaugh how it’s done with the big boys in the NFL. And few were happier than Tristan Wirfs. The Bucs’ left tackle told Joe the Bucs were passing to set up the run in the first half. The Bucs were doing OK after a shaky start. Then in the second half, Wirfs said the Bucs decided to play ground-and-pound just like Schembechler taught his old quarterback, Harbaugh. In the process, the Bucs fully dismantled the Chargers. “We knew it was going to be physical coming in,” Wirfs said after the game. “We knew they would be stingy in the red zone — I don’t even think we scored in the red zone to be honest.” (Rachaad White’s 11-yard touchdown catch from Baker Mayfield was the lone Bucs touchdown in the red zone). So the Bucs changed gears in the second half. “I think we committed to the run a little bit,” Wirfs said of the mentality after halftime. “We had some runs sprinkled in, in the first half, where we were kind of mainly throwing. “So [at halftime] we were like, ‘Let’s stick to the ground game and get the chains moving. It worked out for us.” Damn right, it worked out for the Bucs. Bucky Irving and White combined for 181 rushing yards. And Wirfs was right in that the Bucs were chewing up clock along the way. “To finish the game running the ball was pretty awesome,” Wirfs said. That’s no lie!|2024-12-15 21:49:00|281|17|7|Tristan Wirfs|Bucs dominate with ground game in victory.|8|Overall positive sentiment with excitement about the team's performance and potential in the playoffs.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""DirtyBucs"", ""post"": ""Love to see the ground game going so well.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/mike-evans-streak-hunt-takes-massive-step-forward/|Mike Evans Streak Hunt Takes Massive Step Forward|So future Hall of Fame receiver Mike Evans walked into today’s blowout of the Chargers with 43 catches for 590 yards and 7 touchdowns. He walked out with 52 catches, 749 yards, 9 TDs and a big fat smile. Evans, as nearly every NFL fan knows, is riding a streak of 10 consecutive years of 1,000 yards or more receiving. Only Jerry Rice has more with 11 (1986-1996). With three games remaining, Evans is in solid striking distance of Rice’s historic mark of consistency and greatness. He might even get it without needing the 17th game of the season, something Rice did not have in his day. What impressed Joe today was Evans running a deep route (video below), in addition to his hustle and heart on the scramble drill/crossing route that also went for a very different kind of touchdown with lots of YAC (yards after catch). Evans’ hamstring must finally be healed. For months the Bucs have been allergic to deep shots and Evans hauled in 35-yard strike by Baker Mayfield to put the game away late in the third quarter. Joe’s enjoying every minute of what Evans is accomplishing and Joe has little doubt Evans will hit 1,000 yards if he stays healthy. Another 30 targets should get the job done. |2024-12-15 21:36:00|214|30|8|Mike Evans|Evans nears Rice's historic receiving consistency in impressive performance.|8|Strongly positive sentiment towards Mike Evans, team performance, and playoff outlook.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""MadMax"", ""post"": ""GONNA GET IT GOTTA GET IT!"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""15th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""9:38"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""tgoodwin"", ""post"": ""9 catches, 159 yards and 2 TD , WOW Evans, what a GAME AND oh my STars, those beautiful LONG TD Catches, n made it look EASY   U n BAKER!!!

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/jamel-dean-basks-in-the-win-thanks-to-a-key-rare-interception/|Jamel Dean Basks In The Win Thanks To A Key, Rare Interception|The streak is over! Bucs cornerback Jamel Dean sat at his locker and saw Joe coming. Joe could tell by Dean’s smile he knew what Joe’s first question would be. Joe said to Dean, “The streak has been broken.” Dean busted out laughing. Joe can’t blame him. Not since Dean picked off two passes at New Orleans against the slimy Saints on Sept. 18, 2022, has Dean had an interception. That’s over two years, plus playoffs, for a starting corner in the NFL. That doesn’t happen often. Not only did Dean get a pick, but it also happened to be against a quarterback who rarely throws picks. The last time Justin Herbert threw an interception was Week 2. Somewhere, Tom Brady nods his head in approval. And for the icing on the cake, Dean’s pick changed the game. Late in the first half with the Bucs leading 23-17, Herbert tried to connect with Quentin Johnston down the left seam. From where Joe was sitting in the press box, Joe couldn’t tell immediately if Dean picked it off or Johnston made a crazy catch. But the roar of the thousands of Bucs fans at SoFi Stadium tipped Joe off that Dean got a pick. And the Bucs offense didn’t eff around. Four plays later Baker Mayfield threw an absolute laser to Mike Evans who had single coverage for a 35-yard touchdown and a 30-17 lead. Yes, Gene Deckerhoff, that was a dagger, set up by Dean’s pick. “It’s big because we know what we are playing for,” Dean said. ” We’re playing for the division. To be able to help my team and have them feed off my energy, it’s big.” As for the Bucs winning with smashmouth football, Dean said, “We were just trying to match their intensity.” If Dean suddenly keeps this play up, who knows how good this defense can be? Here’s a fun fact for Bucs fans: When Dean got hurt in New Orleans and went on injured reserve, the Bucs lost four straight. After Dean returned against the Giants, the Bucs are now 4-0.|2024-12-15 21:25:00|348|14|8|Jamel Dean|Dean ends interception drought|7|Mixed sentiment with overall positivity towards Dean's interception performance.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""drdneastup"", ""post"": ""Glad he got it but the INT was more of the result of the defensive pressure being put on Herbert that made him put it up for grabs.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/giving-the-bully-his-own-medicine/|Giving The Bully His Own Medicine|The thing Joe loved so much about this win by the Bucs today was how the Chargers wanted to play smashmouth football and Todd Bowles and his gang flew into town and showed the Chargers how to win with their own formula. And that, Mike Evans told Joe, was what won the game for the Bucs. Let’s face it: After Baker Mayfield threw a pick in the second quarter, most Bucs fans feared the worst. But the defense got a three-and-out and it was just a preview of what was to come. “We knew what to expect coming in,” Evans said in the happy Bucs locker room. “We knew [the Chargers are] a talented team that plays hard. But we knew we were the more talented team. We just had to match their physicality. “We ran the ball. We hit our passes. ‘Bake’ made a lot of great plays with his legs. And our defense did their thing.” They certainly did. In the second half with Los Angeles star quarterback Justin Herbert clearly hobbled, it was like a shark smelling blood in the water. The Bucs defense, with Ryan Neal on the field who was sitting on his couch watching football just a few days ago, acted as if they were the 2002 Bucs defense. The Bucs simply pounded the Chargers. It was a beautiful thing. Evans seemed to think today’s game was a taste of more to come. “We have a very talented team,” Evans said. “We are very excited to be playing for one another this late in the season.”|2024-12-15 20:59:00|262|22|7|Mike Evans|Bucs dominate Chargers with strong physicality and defense.|7|Fans optimistic after dominant win, foresee more victories ahead.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/its-december-football/|“It’s December Football”|Bucs head coach Todd Bowles had a message after today’s chain-whipping of the Chargers in Los Angeles. The Bucs running the ball down the Chargers’ throats 39 times and doing a solid job stopping the run? Bowles says that’s not just winning football, “It’s December football.” And when it comes to December football, Bowles seems to have cracked some of the code. His Bucs are a stunning 9-3 in December games since he took over for the 2022 season. Man, what a coach Bowels would be if he could turn his brand of December football into October football. Perhaps most important is how Bowles’ steady messaging resonates with players in December. He stays calm and on script all season and keeps preaching how staying the course — no matter what may be failing — and fixing little things will put the Bucs where they need to be. That drives a lot of fans insane, including Joe at times, but Joe cannot discount the value of that consistency among the roster. The result today was the best version of December football, a performance that might have been the Bucs’ most emphatic victory since, well, last December. That’s when the Bucs, 363 days ago, went to Green Bay and hammered the Packers en route to their third consecutive NFC South title. If the Bucs can continue playing “December football,” then Joe is confident they’ll have the NFC South wrapped up before January.|2024-12-15 20:56:00|240|15|8|Todd Bowles|Bucs dominate in December|6|Mixed sentiments regarding team performance, cautious optimism, skepticism about challenges ahead.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Saskbucs"", ""post"": ""Great win.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/bucs-just-punched-the-chargers-in-the-mouth/|Bucs Just Punched The Chargers In The Mouth|So Jim Harbaugh and the Chargers, wearing their Powerpuff blue uniforms (Joe loves them), want to play big boy football with the NFL. Old school Big Ten. Smashmouth. Well, the Chargers just met the new bully on the block. The Bucs came into avocado-eating, wine-sipping, Lipstick City Los Angeles and not just punched the Chargers in the mouth, they stomped on their head for s(p)its and giggles and tossed their lunch money in the general direction of one of the many homeless colonies in the area. When have the Bucs last had an impressive win as this? The Chargers looked to be a playoff team. They like to play physical ball and when needed, their star quarterback will like up a defense. The Bucs just kicked their tails with the Chargers’ own formula. And the Bucs, with their 40 points, more than doubled the average points the Chargers allow per game. You want physical ball? There was Lavonte David, as usual, all over the field, with 12 tackles, 1.5 sacks, a tackle for loss, three quarterback hits and a tackle of Chargers receiver Ladd McKonkey that otherwise had seven points written all over it. You want to run? The Bucs had their lightning and thunder, Bucky Irving and Rachaad White. You want the dagger? The Bucs woke up Sunday and realized they still had the best offensive player in franchise history healthy. Mike Evans is him. Evans blew up the Chargers today. His 35-yard touchdown catch off a bullet from Baker Mayfield, man, Joe could just hear Gene Deckerhoff hollering, “Is that a dagger?” Was Mayfield perfect? No, but he sure threw a perfect pass to Evans in the third quarter that shook up the NFL, if anyone was paying attention. This game, today’s game, in Los Angeles, was the most impressive win of the season. More so than the win at Detroit in Joe’s mind. The Bucs were pretty close to full strength at Detroit. The Bucs today were pulling dudes off of couches to play safety and didn’t have Chris Godwin. This was as impressive a win as Joe has seen from the Bucs in a couple of years, certainly not since Bucco Bruce Arians was around. Every Bucs fan deserves to be wildly hungover tomorrow!

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/historic-bucs-run-game-eclipses-2000-yards/|Historic Bucs Run Game Eclipses 2,000 Yards|So the Bucs set out last offseason to fix their statistically NFL-worst running game. Man, Joe’s never seen a fix quite like this, and it’s reached historic levels. Today the Bucs pounded the Chargers 40-17 and hammered away on the ground for 222 yards on 39 carries. The Bucs now have 2,020 rushing yards through 14 games! That total is the most Tampa Bay has racked up since 2015 when they had 2,162 yards on the ground through 16 regular season games, the second-best rushing season in team history. You’d have to go back to 1998 to find a total close to that when the Bucs had 2,148 yards with Warrick Dunn and Mike Alstott in the backfield. In fact, the best Bucs rushing season was in 1979 with 2,437 yards, but NFL football was much different back then. It was a run-first league. Those ’79 Bucs ran the ball 609 times for a 4.0 yards-per-carry average. So if today you were wondering if you’ve ever seen a Bucs running game this good before, well, Joe feels comfortable saying you haven’t. And there’s still three games this season.|2024-12-15 20:29:00|188|30|8|Tampa Bay Buccaneers|Historic rushing milestones reached this season.|9|Fans are enthusiastic about the team's performance and optimistic about the coaching staff.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Again"", ""post"": ""We would have more if Trask was our QB1"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""15th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""8:32"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""74 Bucs Fan"", ""post"": ""Unbelievable!

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/expectations-should-be-high/|Expectations Should Be Sky High|Perhaps everyone now knows why Joe was thoroughly disgusted after the Bucs beat the Panthers two weeks ago. The Bucs have talent, a strong mix of youth and Super Bowl experience, quality coaches and a no-nonsense internal culture with a franchise quarterback. So there simply was no way the Bucs should have needed a near-miracle in overtime to beat sadsack Carolina in a must-win game. But it happened, and it was unacceptable. That “W” wasn’t what it should have been. Today’s hammering of the Chargers is the kind of play the Bucs are capable of every week. And Bucs fans shouldn’t lower their standards. Tampa Bay has an offense with the power to overcome hiccups and there’s too much talent and depth on the defense to not make enough plays to complement that fantastic, balanced yet explosive offense. Joe thinks the Bucs (8-6) can and should win out against Dallas, Carolina and New Orleans and finish 11-6. That would be a seven-game winning streak out of their bye week. Once upon a time in 2020, the Bucs won every game after their bye week … . The Bucs may not have much of an edge rush, but they’ve got a franchise quarterback, playmakers on both sides of the ball and they can score. That makes them capable of nearly anything. Joe feels now how fans of every team should want to feel when the calendar hits Dec. 15. It’s an incredible feeling. Bravo to Buccaneers Ring of Honor general manager Jason Licht and Todd Bowles for what they’ve done to get this club and Bucs fans to this point. Now keep hammering away!|2024-12-15 19:55:00|273|54|6|Tampa Bay Buccaneers|High expectations after recent strong performance and potential win streak.|6|Mixed sentiments with some optimism about team performance but also some criticism and concerns.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Matt"", ""post"": ""You know it\u2019s a great day when Kyle QB2 Trask plays more than 2 snaps"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""15th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""7:57"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Zzbucs"", ""post"": ""Joe\u2026you and some others should acknowledge that you were wrong\u2026..

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/another-big-day-baker-mayfield-now-has-31-touchdowns-3617-yards-and-14-interceptions/|Another Big Day; Baker Mayfield Now Has 32 Touchdowns, 3,617 Yards And 14 Interceptions|It feels so great to have a franchise quarterback on the Bucs. It’s been five consecutive seasons. Joe’s getting very spoiled. After today’s thundering blowout of the Chargers, 40-17, Tampa Bay is now averaging 28.8 points per game. That’s second best in the NFC behind the Lions. And Baker Mayfield’s huge day now puts him at 32 touchdowns, 14 interceptions, 3,617 yards through 14 games. Mayfield made the Pro Bowl last year and he’s been better overall this season. Did Joe mention Mayfield, after 22-of-27 passing for 4 TDs and a pick today, is now completing 70.5 percent of his passes? And Mayfield is having a career year running the ball, though he had two long runs called back today courtesy of Graham Barton holding penalties.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/buccaneers-40-chargers-17/|Buccaneers 40, Chargers 17|How bout that message the Bucs just sent the entire NFL! What a beatdown of a quality Chargers team — on the road. That’s four Bucs wins in a row and there’s not a damn reason in the NFL world that Tampa Bay can’t win its final three games against Dallas, Carolina and New Orleans. For the seventh time this season, the Bucs, now 8-6, scored a touchdown on their opening drive. It didn’t happen all last season. And the offense kept pouring it on despite a couple of hiccups with a Baker Mayfield interception and a Rachaad White fumble. Newsflash: That Chargers defense entered the game allowing the fewest points in the NFL. Joe is so fired up by Mike Evans’ big day. What an angry beast he was. Does that guy look 31 years old? Big Mike racked up 9 catches for 159 yards and 2 touchdowns. Evans now has 749 yards receiving with 3 games remaining to tie Jerry Rice’s all-time record of 11 consecutive seasons of 1,000 or more receiving yards. The Bucs’ punishing running game thundered along to yet another huge day, this time over 200 yards. Rachaad White (64 yards) and Bucky Irving (117 yards) each had 15 carries. On defense, the Bucs made fantastic adjustments in the second half and shut out the Chargers. Freakin’ stunning. Major love for Lavonte David and his two-sack day. The blitzes were humming and the Bucs hit Chargers QB Justin Herbert 9 times. That’s a rare number for the Bucs. Joe also applauds Todd Bowles for how he got his team ready to play and, overall, how he’s stayed a bumpy course with a steady hand. The Bucs are ahead of last year’s pace, which is a very special happening.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/betting-the-bucs-week-15-edition/|Betting The Bucs (Week 15 Edition)|In-game injuries kicked Joe in the groin last Sunday. A valuable lesson.  Raiders QB Aidan O’Connell left the game, as did Bucs running back Bucky Irving. That led Joe to a winless week and dropped Joe’s season record to 10-13 in Bucs-related picks here in this space. “Betting the Bucs” reveals weekly where Joe is throwing cash within that day’s Buccaneers game. Of course, it’s only Joe’s pregame picks, not in-game wagers. (Sports betting is legal in Florida but just via one government-regulated Florida sportsbook monopoly run by the Seminole tribe. That’s where Joe gets the betting lines.) Good luck! Buccaneers to score first (+100) — So the Bucs do a great job scoring on their opening drive and early in games. In fact, Tampa Bay leads the NFL averaging 7.5 points per first quarter. Joe suspects the Bucs will elect to receiver if they win the toss and the Chargers will kick to the Bucs if they win, so that’s a bonus here. The rank No. 12 in the NFL in first-quarter scoring. Justin Herbert over 21.5 completions (-105) — Simply put, nearly every QB has a high-for-them completion total against the Bucs, courtesy of a weak edge rush, soft zone coverage and avoiding the Bucs’ solid run defense. Herbert doesn’t usually complete this many balls, but he doesn’t usually see the Bucs’ pass defense. Jalen McMillan under 2.5 receptions (+120) — Not a good matchup for McMillan against the Chargers secondary, plus Joe believes the wide receiver screens are more likely to go to Sterling Shepard or Mike Evans. And Joe suspects the Chargers’ big pass rush will translate to more passes to running backs and Cade Otton. Joe also likes the +120 here. Chargers under 23.5 points (+100) — The Chargers haven’t busted 23 points in three consecutive weeks and their offense has sputtered with injuries to running back J.K. Dobbins and others. Justin Herbert also has injuries that are hurting his mobility. Joe thinks the Bucs defense will disrupt just enough to keep the Chargers’ total down.|2024-12-15 13:48:00|341|11|5|Betting The Bucs|Weekly sports betting picks with mixed outlook.|4|Mixed sentiment with some optimism and some negativity towards specific players.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""GoneGator"", ""post"": ""Not betting but I think J-Mac gets 3+ catches.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/vita-vea-needs-to-shake-off-production-lull/|Vita Vea Needs To Shake Off Production Lull|Joe was hopeful manbeast Bucs defensive tackle Vita Vea was going to shake off his invisible game against the Panthers and come back last week and rattle the Raiders. It didn’t happen. Over the past two games, Vea has one tackle and one assist. Much more important, he hasn’t looked like his extra-special self. It’s rare for Vea to go two games without wreaking havoc. Joe is not concerned but damn, the Bucs need Vea to not make it three in a row against the Chargers this afternoon in Los Angeles. Joe listened to retired Chargers All-Pro fullback Lorenzo Neal, the ex-Buc (1998), talk about a weakness of the Chargers’ offense on the Bleav podcast network. And guess where it is; the interior offensive line. Neal stressed that Chargers QB Justin Herbert may be the best quarterback in the NFL in the pocket with time. But he needs more of it and the Chargers’ O-line has to stop “getting pushed around up front.” Pressure up the middle on Herbert is troubling Neal, who thinks Herbert can overcome the Chargers’ second-rate receiving weapons. “If you block for this guy, we can beat anybody. Anybody,” Neal said. So what’s it going to be, Mr. Vea? That goes for fellow defensive tackle Calijah Kancey, too. Those guys have a chance to wreck today’s game. Will they?|2024-12-15 09:28:00|223|19|6|Vita Vea|Vea needs to step up for Buccaneers against Chargers.|4|Mixed sentiments about player performance and team strategy in anticipation of upcoming game.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""74 Bucs Fan"", ""post"": ""Break out the lawn mower Vita!"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""15th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""9:38"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""JimBobBuc"", ""post"": ""ESPN this morning is talking about how tough Hebert is, with his ankle and thigh issues.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/zyon/|What Surprise Will Todd Bowles Spring Next?|So what kind of defense will Bucs coach Todd Bowles hatch for today’s game in the City of Angels, where the Bucs play the Chargers? Based on last week, it could be a doozy. Bucs corner Zyon McCollum said Bowles likes to use exotic defenses. And sometimes Bowles’ hand is forced like last week, when he was down three inside linebackers and needed to rely on a dude that Bowles himself said wasn’t ready until recently despite being on the roster for some 11 months (Vi Jones). So Bowles decided not to play a shaky practice squad guy when he could instead play defensive backs with a lot of experience. So for 25 plays (at least), the only inside linebacker Bowles used was Lavonte David. McCollum told Joe last week that’s what’s so fun playing for Bowles. His assignment is a mystery from week to week, especially when injuries crop up. “It’s exciting for me because you never know what to expect,” McCollum said. “If we don’t know what to expect, I know our opponent doesn’t know what to expect. “So it is exciting to go into every week with a new gameplan and to find out how Bowles is going to put us into position.” So, for the one-linebacker defense, how long did McCollum and the Bucs practice that? “Not too long,” McCollum said. “But we trained and cross-trained a lot of positions. A lot of our safeties can play linebacker. And they can play nickel. A lot of our corners can play safety if they need to. “Having that versatility allows Bowles to be able to put in a lot of packages in.” So what can we expect today with the Bucs down so many linebackers (again) and safeties?

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/all-hail-yards-after-catch/|All Hail Yards After Catch|Here is a stat that blew Joe’s mind. A graphic came across Joe’s timeline on Twitter from a stat geek by the name of Jay Cuda.  Joe doesn’t know the guy but Pro-Football-Reference.com backs up Cuda’s numbers. It shows the Bucs are one of the worst teams in the NFL for air yards, meaning completed passes doesn’t travel far. Joe has documented for weeks Bucs offensive coordinator Liam Coen’s aversion to throwing past 20 yards from the line of scrimmage. But Joe can’t nitpick about the results. The Bucs offense is not the problem with this team. Then Joe ran across Cuda’s graphic. It seems of Baker Mayfield’s 3,329 passing yards this year, nearly 60 percent of those yards are YAC yards, or yards after the catch. That’s nuts. In a very good way Remember, this is from a team that lost Chris Godwin for the season and had Mike Evans miss four games, with an unknown of additional games in which Evans played at less than 100 percent. Joe can’t recall every seeing passing numbers so lopsided: air yards for the Bucs is among the worst in the NFL (No. 28) yet YAC yards is No. 1. |2024-12-15 00:01:00|198|10|8|Yards After Catch|Bucs excel in YAC yards|4|Mixed reactions on team performance, uncertainty on key players' future, admiration for offensive strategy.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""ModHairKen"", ""post"": ""I recall during the Jameis era that YAC was very low.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/gameday-tampa-bay-315/|Gameday Tampa Bay|Game 14 Bucs (7-6) at Chargers (8-5) Kickoff: 4:25 p.m. TV: FOX (WTVT-TV Channel 13, locally) with Adam Amin, Mark Sanchez and Kristina Pink.  Streaming: NFL+, YouTube TV (Sunday Ticket) (Geographic restrictions apply; subscription may be required). Radio: Buccaneers Radio Network WXTB-FM 97.9 in the Tampa-St. Petersburg region (Transmisiones de radio en español en WTMP-FM 96.1 y WMGG-AM 1470 en Tampa). Additional stations throughout Florida on the Buccaneers Radio Network can be found here. The game also will be broadcast on SiriusXM Channel 383 (Buccaneers Radio Network feed). Weather: It’s been chilly in the City of Angels. Per AccuWeather.com, tailgaters will have to tolerate temperatures in the upper-50s. Kickoff temperature is expected to be 62 climbing to a high of 67 by halftime. Before the game ends, expect a temperature of 63, all under sunny skies. Technically, SoFi Stadium is not a dome. It is a stadium that instead of a roof, is under a giant canopy that also provides cover for the plaza surrounding it. Odds: Per Hard Rock Bet, as of midnight, Bucs +3 (+125); over/under 45.5. Referees: The history of Scott Novak and his gang suggests this should be a very close game. Or maybe even a Bucs win. Home teams in games with Novak and his outfit working are 27-49-3 against the spread, per Sharp Football Analysis. Given that the Bucs are a three-point dog, if history plays out, the Bucs should be right there with the Chargers in a position to win the game. Injuries: Bucs — Out: ILB K.J. Britt (ankle), S Mike Edwards (hamstring), WR Kameron Johnson (ankle), OLB Markees Watts (knee), S Antoine  Winfield (knee). Questionable: CB Josh Hayes (hamstring), RB Bucky Irving (back/hip), CB Christian Izien (groin), ILB J.J. Russell (hamstring), WR Sterling Shepard (foot), OLB Joe Tryon-Shoyinka (ankle). Chargers — Out: TE Will Disly (shoulder), WR Jalen Reagor (finger). Questionable:  WR Ladd McConkey (knee/shoulder), LB Denzel Perryman (groin). Outlook: Joe has a hunch there is an opening for the Bucs, but a narrow one. Joe has seen the Chargers and just isn’t impressed. Yes, they have a good team but it’s not like the Bucs cannot beat a good team. The Bucs have beaten the Commandoes, Lions and Eagles. The Chargers, with the exception of smallish rookie Ladd McConkey, really don’t have any receivers. Defensively, statistically, their run defense really isn’t any better than the Bucs’, but their pass defense is. The catch here is the Chargers don’t give up the fewest points in the NFL. It seems the Chargers are more of a bend-but-don’t-break defense, so Joe really sees an opportunity for the Bucs. It won’t be easy. The Chargers are a physical team; this is a buckle-your-chin-strap type of game. The last time the Bucs had such a game, Baltimore beat the snot out of them. As always, the key is who scores first.
