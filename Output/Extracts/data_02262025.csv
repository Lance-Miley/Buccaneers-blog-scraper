https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/bucs-waive-goodbye-to-jordan-whitehead/|Bucs Wave Goodbye To Jordan Whitehead|Maybe Tykee Smith will get his wish sooner than he thought. The Bucs today, per Mike Garafolo of NFL Network, told safety Jordan Whitehead his services are no longer needed. Thus ending the second and likely final stint of Whitehead’s Bucs days. The Bucs brought Whitehead back last year on a two-year contract and the Bucs thought they were getting back the hard-hitting safety from their Super Bowl-winning season. Instead, they got a safety who displayed too many loafs for Joe’s liking — and he got hurt. To Whitehead’s credit, he toughed through a pec injury that probably should have sidelined him for the year. With the Bucs not picking up Whitehead’s option for 2025, the Bucs will save some $4.5 million in cap savings.|2025-02-26 14:44:00|125|38|4|Jordan Whitehead|Bucs part ways with underperforming safety player.|3|Mixed feelings with disappointment over player performance and injuries, hope for improvement elsewhere.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Smashsquatch"", ""post"": ""Tykee is a keeper and will excel at safety.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/todd-bowles-thinks-yaya-diaby-could-have-had-15-sacks-in-2024/|Todd Bowles Thinks YaYa Diaby Could Have Had 15 Sacks In 2024|While Todd Bowles was very open yesterday in his combine media sessions in Indianapolis about the Bucs needing more production from the defensive edge on pass plays, he was effusive in his praise for edge rusher YaYa Diaby. Bowles believes Diaby was this-close to having double-digit sacks. “We thought he was one of our best pass rushers,” Bowles said of Diaby. “He had more pressures than anybody. He didn’t finish them, but we thought he became a much better player.” In his second season, Diaby had 4.5 sacks, down from 7.5 as a rookie. Still, Bowles was impressed by how quarterbacks had to make an effort to avoid a sack from Diaby’s smoke. “He wasn’t thinking as much,” Bowles said. “Some of those [rushes] could have easily turned into a 15-sack year.” That would have been triple of what Diaby actually had. Bowles believes the sacks will come. He raved about Diaby’s work ethic and dedication to his craft. “He’s playing his tail off,” Bowles said. “I was really happy the way he played. Obviously he didn’t have the results that you really want. But the way he played was unbelievable.” Joe still maintains if the Bucs got a proven edge rusher (you know, like this guy), Diaby’s numbers would shoot up as teams won’t be keying on him so much.|2025-02-26 13:14:00|221|31|5|YaYa Diaby|Bowles optimistic about Diaby's potential for more sacks in future.|3|Mixed feelings about Bowles, scheme, and player potential in the comments.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Chris"", ""post"": ""Well that didn\u2019t happen because Bowles was to busy worrying about dropping him into coverage on our biggest 3rd down of the season against WAS ."", ""post_time"": [""February"", ""26th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""1:21"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Leopold Stotch"", ""post"": ""Yeah, I think he can be really good too, he needs a partner and a scheme where we have everyone rush and not drop in coverage all the dang time, pretending to play zone."", ""post_time"": [""February"", ""26th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""1:23"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""Chris"", ""post"": ""I sure hope when he watched all that film , he thought to himself yeah I can\u2019t drop me Ends into coverage like that."", ""post_time"": [""February"", ""26th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""1:25"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter3"": {""username"": ""Rod Munch"", ""post"": ""I\u2019ve mentioned it before, but if you listened to other teams podcasts after we played them \u2013 they almost always mentioned how good Yaya looked.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/boiling-on-the-inside/|“Boiling On The Inside”|So what’s rookie Bucs offensive coordinator Josh Grizzard really like? Joe’s been learning more about that at the NFL Scouting Combine this week. Grizzard’s replacement Liam Coen talked about him, as did Dolphins head coach Mike McDaniel, Grizzard’s mentor in Miami. Bucs head coach Todd Bowles dove in during his visit to the Ira Kaufman Podcast. “I think he’s very intelligent, No. 1,” Bowles said of Grizzard. “He’s very innovative and creative. He won’t just sit there and rest off of last year’s laurels. He’ll get better. As far as tweaking some things and becoming better offensively, he’s not shy to ask questions over things he does not know. He will use [Kevin] Carberry and [Brian] Picucci in the run game to help him decipher it that way. And he had a very calm demeanor even though he’s boiling on the inside. I think he can handle the pressure and call the games that way and still go for the jugular. I like his aggressiveness as well as being smart. There’s no such thing as a slam dunk right now, but I think it will help him and benefit him going forward.” So it seems Grizzard is on fire beneath his chill vibe. Joe likes that.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/dropping-edge-rushers-more-in-coverage-explained/|Dropping Edge Rushers More In Coverage Explained|Sometimes Joe would run head first into blunt objects when the Bucs would take edge rushers and down linemen and drop them into pass coverage. It was maddening. It felt at times like waving a white flag, or at least a sign that says, ‘Our edge rush stinks.’ Yes, the Bucs did more of that than usual last season and head coach Todd Bowles explained yesterday on the Ira Kaufman Podcast. “It would really help us if we could rush the passer with four guys,” Bowles said. “Other than YaYa Diaby — on the outside I’m talking here, not the inside guys — we didn’t get consistent pressure from the other side. And at the same time, when you’re down a corner and a safety, you gotta give them help from somewhere. So when those guys weren’t rushing the passer [effectively], we decided to drop [edge rushers in coverage] a little bit more than normal and get pressure from other ways like up the middle with Lavonte [David] and doing certain things like that with [Calijah] Kancey and moving him around. So we’d like to get pressure with four, that would help the secondary immensely.” What an admission there by Bowles. His tone was candid, as fans can hear. Yes, Jason Pierre-Paul and Bucs sacks king Shaq Barrett would drop in coverage during their run as stud Bucs edge rushers, but it wasn’t to the degree seen last season. The Bucs were desperate to put heat on quarterbacks, and while their sacks total was tied for seventh in the NFL, the overall QB pressure wasn’t ideal.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/bowles-on-tush-push/|Todd Bowles Wants To Keep The Tush Push|At the Indiana Convention Center, a lot of buzz has been stirred up by one play: The tush push. The Packers filed formal paperwork to have the league vote to ban the Eagles’ famous rugby-like play, which for others is a quarterback sneak. It’s very effective because Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts is such a strong, tough runner and Philadelphia has a very physical offensive line. Since it came out that the Packers want to ban it, Raheem Morris and Sean McDermott, head coaches of the Dixie Chicks and Bills, respectively, are forcefully whining about it. McDermott even reached for the lazy excuse that the play is too dangerous for football players. Why? What evidence is there that players are being wheeled off the field right and left due to the play? McDermott didn’t provide any intel. Joe found it interesting that so far, the two most vocal coaches against the tush push while speaking at the combine are both defensive guys. Well, not all defensive guys are against the tush push. Enter Bucs coach Todd Bowles. Maybe because the Bucs have had decent luck against the tush push, Bowles all but said it’s up to defensive coaches to devise a way to stop it. “I think it is a rugby element, but at the same time, when a team gets something that they are good at, you’ve got to stop it,” Bowles said. “I don’t think the first thing you have to do is take it out of the ballgame. “That takes away the creativity [of offenses]. We have to learn how to stop it. Until we learn how to stop it they will continue — if it is not broke, don’t fix it. “It’s a good challenge for defensive coaches. You just have to figure it out.” Well, it helps to have physical players on your defensive line to stop it and the Bucs have that. Former Philadelphia center Jason Kelce remarked how brutal it is for a center on that play to try to push back Vita Vea. If there is any human in the NFL built to stop the tush push, it’s the human wrecking ball Vea. Joe agrees with Bowles. McDermott, Morris, the Packers and others are whining because they can’t stop it. So they want it banned.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/could-the-bucs-be-preparing-for-life-after-chris-godwin/|Could The Bucs Be Preparing For Life After Chris Godwin?|Joe didn’t like the vibe from Bucs types yesterday at the combine inside the NFL beehive that is the Indiana Convention Center.  That bad vibe came when they were talking about Chris Godwin. The Bucs love Godwin but his dislocated ankle suffered against the Crows in October seems to have the team at least a little bit concerned. It’s a major injury without question. Will Godwin be the old Godwin when he’s able to return to the field — if he returns to the field? Bucs coach Todd Bowles rattled off four areas that he is focusing on improving the team. Edge rush, inside linebacker, secondary and wide receiver. If the Bucs were confident about Godwin’s return, why focus on receiver? Then Joe read a mock draft from an awful mocker, Bucky Brooks of NFL Network. Joe simply doesn’t care for mock drafts unless it is the last one a mocker does before the actual draft. Besides, too many of these guys have cavalier attitudes and openly scoff at striving for accuracy. So why should Joe pay five seconds of attention to your nonsense if you’re not trying to be accurate? What’s the point? However, in Brooks’ mock he had the Bucs selecting Ohio State receiver Emeka Egbuka at No. 19. This Egbuka is a Godwin clone. Anyone who has watched the Buckeyes the past two years has seen that. Egbuka is reliable; he loves to block in the run game and he’s tough as hell. Just like Godwin is. That got Joe thinking: The draft is deep at edge rusher. Maybe Bucs AC/DC-loving general manager Licht thinks he can draft the next Godwin at No. 19 and still get an edge rusher in the second round? Bowles mentioned yesterday that there are all kinds of talented players at inside linebacker; they’re just getting pushed down in the draft by receivers and edge rushers. Look, if the Bucs believe Godwin can bounce back from an ugly injury, great. If Godwin leaves, and the Bucs get this Egbuka, that’s about the best-case scenario out of an otherwise depressing turn of events. https:/twitter.com/dpbrugler/status/1841262123420196957  |2025-02-26 10:30:00|351|31|3|Bucs|Concerns about Chris Godwin's injury and potential draft strategy.|5|Mixed sentiments ranging from pessimistic to optimistic and neutral comments on player acquisition and team strategy.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""BuckyBuc"", ""post"": ""if this happens then please trade back"", ""post_time"": [""February"", ""26th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""10:36"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""SlyPirate"", ""post"": ""RAIDERS MAKE TOO MUCH SENSE 1.

In a recent edition of the “Dudes on Dudes” podcast with his former teammate Julian Edelman, former Bucs star tight end Gronk strongly hinted he was thinking of a comeback because he said the way he was working out (with Baker Mayfield) he felt better than he did when he last played. Reports shortly came out of Denver that Gronk was interested in playing for the Broncos because he became tight with Denver coach Sean Payton when the two worked together at FOX. Well, good guy and NFL insider Jordan Schultz got a hold of Gronk and he seemed surprised anyone would be discussing his possible comeback. “Crazy bro. They must know something about me that I don’t. I wish I still had those powers, because that would be cool if I did. But I was just in Australia for a few days. Now it’s time to relax a little. No football.” Well Gronk, people got the idea of a comeback from you! LOL Look, Joe likes Gronk. Who doesn’t like Gronk? But the Tampa resident always liked to play games with media, dropping some news one day then pulling a where-did-you-get-that-idea-from reaction. 🙂 So no, it looks like Gronk’s done.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/tykee-smith-wants-a-position-change/|Tykee Smith Wants A Position Change|The Buccaneers head coach made it very clear yesterday as he stood arm’s length from Joe in Indianapolis.  Standout 2024 Bucs rookie nickel cornerback/safety Tykee Smith wants to play safety next season — full-time. And, per Coach Bowles, the Bucs will be looking at making that move when spring practice fires up in March. For Joe, it was a clear sign the Bucs are strongly considering moving on from safety Jordan Whitehead, who had a significant injury in a January car accident. Whitehead also didn’t have a good season. Joe asked Bowles if Smith didn’t like nickel or didn’t feel it suited his game. No, Bowles replied, Smith wants to be on the field for every snap and the Bucs like him on the field. That’s understandable considering Bowles is adamant he wants “ballhawks.” Smith had 2 interceptions and 3 forced fumbles last season (and a fourth was stolen by a bad call). Joe thinks versatile Christian Izien looks primed to return to his 2023 nickel spot. He’s well liked and respected at One Buc Palace.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/quality-pass-rusher-just-hit-the-market/|Quality Pass Rusher Just Hit The Market|Big news already this morning from the beehive of the combine, the Indiana Convention Center in downtown Indianapolis. You know the Bucs need an edge rush; Joe knows it. Shoot, Bucs brass yesterday shrugged their shoulders and confessed they needed more production from the edge. Help may be available. The Titans announced they have given permission for their edge rusher, Harold Landry, 28, to seek a trade. Hallelujah! Joe was totally geeked about this as Joe’s morning coffee is not hitting. Joe always liked this Landry when he came out of Boston College. Joe remembers some Bucs fans on this here website mocked Joe for his Landry love. The last three years Landry has racked up 31.5 sacks playing for a lousy team, though he does have Jeffery Simmons playing inside of him. Potentially in Tampa, Landry could be playing with Calijah Kancey and Vita Vea inside and YaYa Diaby on the opposite side. What impressed Joe about Landry, and did since he was in college, is he didn’t and hasn’t played on good teams. Offenses can key on him more. If he ever played on a good team, like the Bucs, where offenses couldn’t always double-team him, imagine how he could blow up. Joe would take Landry over Myles Garrett, as crazy as that sounds, because he wouldn’t be nearly as expensive. Landry is set to earn $17.5 million this season and is signed through 2026. What a way to start a gloomy, chilly Wednesday morning in Indianapolis. Joe is stoked! Let’s kick ass today!

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/jason-licht-on-offensive-coordinators-revolving-door/|Jason Licht On Offensive Coordinators Revolving Door|Former Bucs quarterback Chris Simms didn’t beat around the bush. Yesterday, Bucs AC/DC-loving general manager Jason Licht went through the media car wash at the combine held at the Indiana Convention Center in downtown Indianapolis. First, he spent roughly 20 minutes with the NFL media at large. Then, he spent another 20 minutes or so with the Tampa Bay pen and mic club. Then, it was off to do PFT Live, co-hosted by the creator, curator and overall guru of Pro Football Talk, the great Mike Florio, along with Simms. Pleasantries were barely finished when Simms came right out and said it. “Why do you keep losing OCs?” Simms blurted. That’s sort of a trick question. What’s Licht to say, he doesn’t want any of his coaches to reach for their dreams when given an opportunity? So Licht tried to put a spin on the subject, trying to put a smile on an otherwise depressing topic. “I guess it’s a good thing,” Licht said. “I think [Nick] Saban went through a lot of offensive coordinators at Alabama. “It’s a good thing. John Harbaugh and Baltimore [have gone through offensive coordinators]. So it’s, it’s crazy though.” Lost in the chatter about coordinators getting head coaching jobs after one year with the Bucs is head coach Todd Bowles’ angle. As Licht correctly pointed out, Bowles has displayed a knack for choosing quality coordinators. “It’s a testament to our head coach doing a great job hiring the right people,” Licht said. “Then we have a good offense, some good pieces there.” So the question is, can Bowles go three-for-three with offensive coordinators now that he has promoted Josh Grizzard? (Bowles inherited Byron Leftwich and didn’t waste any time after the season giving him his justly deserved walking papers) If the Bucs offense is again top-10 this fall, Joe thinks that would be a heck of an accomplishment. If that happens, Joe would like to know where is Grizzard coaching next year.|2025-02-26 07:00:00|328|20|6|Jason Licht|Challenges with offensive coordinators in Buccaneers organization|2|Mixed sentiments on coaches and players, with some criticism and skepticism expressed throughout the comments.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Lt.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/liam-coen-addresses-josh-grizzard-hire/|Liam Coen Addresses Josh Grizzard Hire|So yesterday, Liam “El Serpiente” Coen told Joe that he’s been cool with JoeBucsFan.com giving him a hard time and, in fact, he doesn’t even consider it a hard time.  That was cool. Joe had a private chat with Coen but also asked him on the record about the Bucs replacing him with Josh Grizzard. Coen hired Grizzard from the Dolphins last offseason. In Miami, Grizzard was a quality control coach for two seasons under Mike McDaniel. In Tampa, Grizzard got to be a daily voice in the crafting of the Bucs offense as passing game coordinator. Coen says Grizzard is more than ready for many reasons. “Josh is going to do a phenomenal job,” Coen said. “He’s got a really unique way about him to be able to connect with a lot of different people: coaches, players. He’s got a great sense of humor. “He’s up there in terms of the IQ, the football knowledge, the ability to see it, design it, and also be able to communicate it to the guys. You know, he’s primed for his. He’s ready for this. And I think he’s going to do a really nice job.” That’s the third time Joe has been told that Grizzard has a unique ability to connect and relate to players and staff. It’s not a coincidence. It seems like “Griz” is one of those guys gifted in relationships. Joe apologizes to those offended by Coen’s face on this site.

Trask spent two years as the No. 3 quarterback behind Tom Brady and the past two as Baker Mayfield’s backup. Trask hasn’t started a game and has thrown 11 passes. Still, he’s shown his bosses enough. Licht was unsure the two sides could/would get a deal done. Bowles and Licht each said Trask might be looking for a greater chance to play. Joe was focused on the body language when Licht and Bowles talked about Trask. There was no waiver or waffling as their was with chatter about Jamel Dean and Jordan Whitehead.|2025-02-26 00:00:00|144|32|7|Kyle Trask|Bucs want to re-sign Trask for a fifth season.|4|Mixed opinions on Kyle's future in the league, uncertainty about his potential as a starting QB.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Beeej"", ""post"": ""Were I Kyle, I\u2019d take a chance, wonder IF"", ""post_time"": [""February"", ""26th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""12:08"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""JimBobBuc"", ""post"": ""Kyle should take a shot somewhere else where he has a better chance to play.
