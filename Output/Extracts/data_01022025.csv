https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/saints-in-soft-tank-mode/|Saints In “Soft Tank” Mode|Happy 10th anniversary to Team Glazer and Buccaneers Ring of Honor general manager Jason Licht! Joe is late on this because the NFL has now blessed fans with a 17-game schedule, but it’s been 10 full years since the Bucs tanked their season finale before their hometown fans. What a Lost Decade moment in time that was as the 2014 season closed. Some Bucs fans were in favor of tanking to lose to the Saints. That meant securing the No. 1 overall pick in the 2015 NFL Draft. And the Bucs were on board. After losing every home game that season, the Bucs decided they had to lose one more. The Chase for Jameis was on! But a lot of folks who had coughed up their hard-earned cash to see a quality home football game were treated to a very expensive sh** sandwich and didn’t appreciate it. The problem was, the bumbling Bucs wouldn’t admit they were tanking. They didn’t rest starters. Instead, they yanked them haphazardly after the opening kickoff so it didn’t feel as bad to the home faithful. Poor Mike Evans. He has told a story of getting a halftime IV in that game so he’d be hydrated for the second half — only to be told he wasn’t playing. Lavonte David got pulled from the game, so did Vincent Jackson. No way did the Bucs want to win. That’s why quarterback Josh McCown went the distance instead of Mike Glennon filling in. But the Saints also were a losing team that didn’t need a win or necessarily want one. So right on cue, the bumbling Bucs jumped out to a big early lead. Still, they nearly tanked the tank. Then-Bucs wide receiver Tavarres King, a late-season practice squad call-up, was targeted over the middle on a quick in-route with 5:30 to play and the Bucs driving with a six-point lead. The ball was catchable and would have been the first catch of King’s career, but he couldn’t wrap his mitts around it. The ball popped into the air and was intercepted. The rest is history. On Sunday, it’s widely believed that the five-win Saints will be tanking against the Bucs in Tampa for a better draft pick. But this time is very different. The Bucs need a victory and have a high-voltage offense. Ex-Bucs quarterback Chris Simms of NBC’s Pro Football Talk called it a “soft tank” that will come from the Saints on Sunday. Joe’s listened to some New Orleans media this week call it a full-blown tank, though many say it doesn’t matter because the Saints don’t have enough talent to compete with the Bucs anyway. The Saints have scored only 57 points in their last five games. However Sunday plays out, Joe just hopes the Bucs accomplish their goal more smoothly that they did 10 years ago. A tight game against a tanking opponent would be very troubling.|2025-01-02 18:17:00|485|36|6|Saints|Buccaneers faced tanking controversy 10 years ago|4|Mixed feelings about game importance, focusing on challenge, players' effort, and opponent's motivation.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""BA\u2019s Red Pen"", ""post"": ""F the Aint\u2019s"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""2nd,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""6:22"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Anyhony"", ""post"": ""If the Bucs would\u2019ve beaten the Cowboys we would be debating resting Evans or going for the record.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/liam-coen-raves-about-mike-evans-the-football-player/|Liam Coen Raves About Mike Evans The Football Player|Many Bucs fans are on pins and needles wondering if the Bucs can feed future Hall of Fame receiver Mike Evans the ball enough to gain 85 yards and get to 1,000 receiving yards Sunday. That would extend his consecutive streak of 1000-yard seasons to 11 years, tying the great Jerry Rice.  However, Bucs offensive coordinator Liam Coen wants fans to understand what a complete professional football player Evans is. He’s not just about receiving records or catching ball. Coen raved how Evans is still a yes-sir, no-sir receiver willing to do whatever it takes for his offense to score touchdowns and win games. “Look at the things he does without the ball, as well,” Coen said. “The way he’s blocked this year for us — talk about somebody that has bought into what we’re trying to do, that didn’t really have to do that all that often. That just speaks to the character of the person, the leader, the man. “That’s just who he is. He doesn’t say much; he just keeps going about his business and doing it the right way. We’ve probably gotten him out of his comfort zone, maybe in some ways, not just in the pass game but more so in the run game. That’s stuff that he hadn’t had to do much of before. “Credit him, he just put his head down and went [out] and continued to work. The results speak for themselves.” In an age where it seems almost every receiver is all about “me,” Evans is a guy who’s all about “we.” The Bucs are so, so fortunate to have a superior receiver who also is a great example to younger receivers on how to go about the game. Talk about hitting the draft lottery. As much as Evans is the full definition of a pro football player, Joe sure hopes Coen and the Bucs empty their playbook to get Evans open on Sunday (after a win is secured) if he still needs plays to cross the finish line with 1,000 yards.|2025-01-02 16:34:00|341|27|8|Mike Evans|Complete professional and team player|6|Mixed feelings about Mike Evans with a focus on achievements, incentives, and gameplay.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Saskbucs"", ""post"": ""We better see a play action deep shot to Mike early Sunday Liam!"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""2nd,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""4:41"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""BradyGronk Fan"", ""post"": ""To be great you have to do something great.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/shaq-barrett-its-sweeter-to-come-back-home/|Shaq Barrett: “It’s Sweeter To Come Back Home”|“Home” won out over maybe cash or perhaps jewelry. That’s the way Bucs sacks king Shaq Barrett saw it when, last week, he decided to come out of retirement and play once again for the Bucs. Shaq had signed in March with the Dolphins but shocked everyone when he retired in July. Last week the Dolphins agreed to release him and when he cleared waivers, it was open season. Shaq noted the first two teams “maybe” three weeks ago to call his agent, oily Drew Rosenhaus, were the Eagles and Lions. A short time later, the Bucs called. That was it. Slam dunk. Shaq would return to Tampa Bay. “It’s so much sweeter to come back here, home, with the guys I know already and the playbook is still — it’s hard — there are still some plays I know so it’s not like I have to relearn everything,” Shaq said. “No brainer to come back here. No brainer.” Shaq admitted that even though he told Kay Adams back in August that he would only play for the Bucs, his mindset and maybe not even his heart was set on returning to football at that time. Basically, Shaq said, when he felt wanted by other teams, it motivated his heart to return. Shaq admitted Bucs coach Todd Bowles’ defensive playbook is different from what he was used to the past four seasons. But there are enough of the same core responsibilities, assignments and plays to make learning the rest of the playbook much smoother than trying to learn another team’s from scratch. Shaq said when the Bucs called he was “excited” and only spoke to Detroit and Philadelphia as a courtesy to inform them of his plans. “I couldn’t wait to get back going again,” Shaq said. He also confessed he was not 100 percent motivated to play for the Dolphins. “If you are not 100 percent in it, you’re not going to be good to anybody. … Having that time away helped me find that love for the game again.” Shaq said he is “nowhere near” able to play a full game but since beginning workouts a month ago, he feels he can log a few plays on Sunday if Bucs trainers give him the green light. Also, Shaq said this comeback is not a one-off. He wants to play next season and if Father Time allows, maybe play through 2027. Shaq said he stayed locked in on the Bucs and only missed watching two games this season. Surprisingly, one element that enticed Shaq back to the Bucs was the offense. That’s right. That’s not a typo. The Bucs offense energized him. While watching Bucs games, Shaq couldn’t help but think about chasing quarterbacks as they try to pass their way back into the game because the Bucs are lighting up the scoreboard. “Dang, I would love to play with an offense like we’ve got now,” Shaq said he thought to himself. “Get the points up on the board and then the [opposing] offense has to try to match. You can’t throw quick passes the whole game.” Shaq admitted he can’t wait to make quarterbacks eat dirt.|2025-01-02 16:13:00|528|20|7|Shaq Barrett|Shaq Barrett returns to Bucs excited to play with familiar team.|4|Mixed sentiment with some optimism but also concern about Shaq's performance last season.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""JimBobBuc"", ""post"": ""It\u2019s my understanding that Shaq\u2019s family stayed in Tampa when he went to Miami.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/rams-tanking-shot-at-no-3-nfc-seed/|Rams Tanking Shot At No. 3 NFC Seed|Rams head coach Sean McVay is one smart guy. The man with the astounding 7-4 record in the playoffs on top of a 80-51 regular-season record has a firm rule. He always considers resting players in a meaningless game. McVay routinely sits all starters and key players in preseason (smart!) and he plans to rest his starters Sunday in the Rams’ season finale against Seattle. But wait! The Rams are 10-6 and need to win in order to make sure they keep the No. 3 seed. If the Bucs win and the Rams lose, then the Bucs (9-7) will be the No. 3 seed. Whatever team lands the No. 4 seed will host the loser of Sunday night’s clash between the Vikings and Lions. Each team is 14-2 and will fight to the death for the NFC North crown and the No. 1 seed in the NFC. Joe suspects McVay prefers to face the banged up loser of that game as it hits the road for a cross-country trip — with a fully rested Rams team. Will the strategy work? Will the Rams win with Jimmy Garoppolo at QB? Joe will take the No. 3 seed happily if it falls in the Bucs’ lap.|2025-01-02 15:48:00|204|30|2|Rams|Coach McVay strategic but risky move for playoff seed.|4|Fans are cautious and focused on beating the Saints.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/negotiator-in-chief-liam-coen/|Negotiator-In-Chief Liam Coen|Bravo to savvy podium NFL contract negotiator Liam Coen today at One Buc Palace. The Bucs’ superstar offensive coordinator wants a head coaching job, he told the world today during his weekly Bucs news conference. But maybe not now, he added. Maybe age 39 is not his time because he’s having so much fun, Coen said. This was right out of sales masterclass and Coen did it all with smile. Man, perhaps Coen should get on the phones with the Bucs’ season tickets team once a week. Smile and dial ad pull in the cash. Coen knows he will be in demand soon as a head coach candidate. Rest assured his agent knows the landscape intimately right now. But hey, why not put it out there that perhaps you’re happy to sit tight and soak in the Florida sun and pass on what could be $20 million of guaranteed money in a new job. Brilliant! Yes, Team Glazer still has time to open the vault and make Coen an offer to pass on interviews in this month’s NFL hiring cycle. But time is running out. Fill that bag of Coen cash. The man must have a price to pass on spinning the wheel. “I do believe I’m ready to [be a head coach],” Coen said today. “But yeah, that is a dream. Does that need to happen when I’m 39 years old and having probably the most fun in my life — coaching and working and being here? No. “That doesn’t mean that needs to occur right now. But yeah, that is the goal. That is absolutely the goal. But like I said before, that goal can hold off for a while here and continue to do what we’re doing. That would be pretty special.” Again, masterful weaving by Coen. He reminded Joe of a Border Collie at an agility competition. Is a “hold off for a while” on head coach interest a reference to confidence in a Super Bowl run this season, or is Coen hinting he’ll hang out another full year in Tampa because it’s so cool? Nobody knows. And that’s the point. Joe is confident Team Glazer will act in the best interest of winning in this case.|2025-01-02 14:28:00|371|47|7|Liam Coen|Coen's strategic negotiation for head coaching role in NFL.|6|Mixed opinions on Coen's future with varying levels of optimism and concern.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Beeej"", ""post"": ""I hope they pay him a mint to stay at least one more year, then when somebody snipes him we\u2019ll get a draft pick"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""2nd,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""2:33"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""HC Grover"", ""post"": ""Pay him!

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/saliva-day-at-bucs-headquarters/|Saliva Day At Bucs Headquarters|Joe’s head is still spinning from listening to Dave Hamilton, the Bucs’ director of performance science. And it has nothing to do with Hamilton’s English accent. The Bucs trotted out Hamilton on the Buccaneers Radio Network to talk about all things performance science and there was just too much for Joe’s beer-soaked brain to comprehend. In short, the team’s performance science department is an intricate machine and one Buccaneers Ring of Honor general manager Jason Licht pushed to establish, per Hamilton, and Licht remains a devout supporter of its work. Wednesdays? Players all peform three jumps for the performance team, which studies every element of each jump and compares it to prior data to determine individual levels of fatigue. Wednesday is also when the team records “subjective” wellness data from each player to study and compare. Fridays? Hamilton says those are about spit. “Saliva sample that will tell us about their testosterone,” he said. “That’s another indicator whether [players are] in a state of stress or recovery.” Of course, Bucs players are wired up at every practice. Technology tracks their acceleration, deceleration, speed, distance and physical responses. It’s all part of one giant equation to have meaningful performance conversations with players and coaches. Hamilton had more to say but Joe is getting overloaded thinking about this topic. For the sake of entertainment as well as performance, Joe thinks Todd Bowles (or any head coach) should be studied in similar ways during a season. Logic says it would be valuable to know if your guy calling the gameday shots is on the brink of a breakdown, mental or physical. And Joe certainly thinks Licht should be studied like a lab rat from April 1 through two days after the NFL Draft. Turn the findings into one of those “In The Current” features.|2025-01-02 12:37:00|301|24|7|Saliva Day At Bucs Headquarters|Performance science intricacies at Buccaneers HQ.|5|Responses vary from skepticism and criticism to curiosity and interest in sports science and technology.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Bonan"", ""post"": ""Interesting!

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/we-go-back-to-the-tom-brady-debate-or-controversy/|“We Go Back To The Tom Brady Debate Or Controversy”|So Harvard-man Amazon analyst and 17-year NFL quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick was diving into the Bucs this week.  Two seasons with Tampa Bay (2017-2018) and multiple years living in Tampa afterwards make Fitzpatrick an extra-interesting listen for Joe. And this week on his podcast Fitzpatrick carved out time to talk about Baker Mayfield. All of Mayfield’s A-list intagibles, per Fitzpatrick, are now matched by elite statistics. And Fitzpatrick is so impressed, he thinks the Bucs can make a postseason run. Most interesting to Joe was Fitzpatrick buying into the Mayfield comment months ago when he claimed the Bucs asked him to “bring the joy back to football” for teammates that had lost it under the stress of Tom Brady. “We go back to the Tom Brady debate or controversy earlier in the year,” Fitzpatrick said. “They asked him to come in, to bring joy back to football for the guys that weren’t having any fun, and you want to talk about the perfect quarterback to do that. And yes, he’s doing that but he’s doing it now at an elite level to where he’s going to get [the Bucs] in the playoffs. Like we talked about, they’re going to make some noise.” “I love the Bucs in the playoffs. Let’s just hope that they take care of business [Sunday] and get in, which they should.” Lost in the Bucs’ run, winning five of six games, is the improvement of Mayfield through a career year, and him becoming cemented as the Bucs’ franchise quarterback. Mayfield has become a beloved figure across the Bay area and Joe knows he’s beloved in all corners of One Buc Palace. He has brought a lot of joy back to Bucs football that went missing in 2022. But Joe can’t hang all that lost joy on Brady, though. Todd Bowles was still adjusting as a surprise head coach and Byron Leftwich had no answers for his impotent offense.|2025-01-02 10:39:00|321|44|5|Tom Brady|Fitzpatrick praises Baker Mayfield and Bucs playoff potential.|5|Mixed sentiments towards Brady and Baker, focus on winning and leadership over joy.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""SlyPirate"", ""post"": ""Baker was asked to bring joy after 3 years TB12.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/will-pro-bowl-snub-ignite-baker-mayfield/|Will Pro Bowl Snub Ignite Baker Mayfield?|Joe suspects a person or two at One Buc Palace is quietly smiling today. The Pro Bowl roster was issued by the NFL this morning, as Joe wrote earlier, and Baker Mayfield is not among the three quarterbacks named to the NFC. Those honors went to Jayden Daniels, Sam Darnold and Jared Goff. Do Darnold and Daniels have better numbers than Mayfield? No. And that’s just the kind of snub that becomes fuel for a guy like Mayfield, who loves reasons to be angry in a good way. The mighty Bucs offense has just one Pro Bowler, Tristan Wirfs? Josh Jacobs is in over Bucky Irving? Mayfield was named an alternate, so he’ll get a call-up to the Pro Bowl if one of the three QBs above him skip the festivities.

When the Bucs have scored first, they’ve only lost one game. So they’re 9-1. That loss was to the Crows. When the Bucs haven’t scored first, they are oh-fer, winless. So you can see why the Bucs stress starting fast. (It’s so hard for Joe to wrap his head around how the Bucs, with one of the best offenses in the league, have not overcome even a 3-0 deficit.) So yesterday Baker Mayfield was discussing the high-powered offense and when he knows the offense is going to have a good day. Not surprising, it’s how the offense starts, he said. The slimy Saints, Sunday’s opponent, have a sad defense, 30th overall in yards allowed per game (379). Their run defense is 30th. The slimy Saints’ pass defense is 27th. Even if the Bucs don’t score first, there is no reason why the Bucs offense should struggle unless there are a rash of injuries.|2025-01-02 09:00:00|161|13|5|Baker Mayfield|Offense performance depends on fast start against weak defense.|4|Mixed sentiment with concerns about Bucs' performance against a tough opponent and admiration for Mayfield.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Bucsfan"", ""post"": ""Knowing all this-Why would you ever defer to your possession to the second half kickoff?

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/is-shaq-barrett-ready/|Is Shaq Barrett Ready?|Joe finds it interesting how the Bucs determine “ready.” And how the Bucs reward “ready.” Take this Vi Jones. The Bucs signed the linebacker late last season and placed him on the notorious practice squad. And there he sat for about 11 months. Meanwhile, while the Bucs were bereft of talent due to injuries this season — SirVocea Dennis was hurt. K.J. Britt was hurt. J.J. Russell was dinged up. — where was Jones? He wasn’t ready, Bucs coach Todd Bowles said. Wait a minute. You had the guy 11 months and he still wasn’t ready? What was this guy doing in all that time, including training camp, playing Madden and shopping Amazon between crossword puzzles? After the Bucs promoted Jones to the parent squad and he got a few games under his belt, Jones started making some plays. He even forced a couple of fumbles in Los Angeles. Hey, maybe the Bucs have something here? Maybe all that investment time paid off? Nope. Jones got cut last week and claimed by the Cardinals to their active roster. Last Friday brought the return of Bucs sacks king Shaq Barrett out of mothballs. Yeah, that’s how negligent the edge rush is for the Bucs. Hell, a backup outside linebacker (Anthony Nelson) leads Bucs edge rushers with four sacks. Can you imagine? So Joe understands if bringing Shaq back is seen by some as a panic move. But why not sign him What’s the harm? Shaq hasn’t played in a game since last year’s Bucs playoffs. Is he in shape for game action? Or will Bowles deem him not ready? Yesterday, Bowles said the eyeball test suggests Shaq is ready, though the Bucs only had a walk-through Wednesday (read: less intense than underwear football). “In the walkthrough today, he was outstanding,” Bowles crowed sarcastically. “He ran pretty [well]. Over the weekend, he ran pretty [well]. You don’t know until you put the helmet and pads on.” Shaq was inactive for the Stinking Panthers game on Sunday and Joe will wait and see if Shaq is on the field Sunday against the slimy Saints.. Why not play him if he’s physically capable? Let Shaq shake off the rust. Get his sea legs back. He can’t be much worse rushing the passer from the edge than what the Bucs currently throw out there.|2025-01-02 07:00:00|389|26|2|Shaq Barrett|Shaq's readiness questioned|3|Mixed opinions on Shaq's readiness and impact, with some skepticism and hope expressed.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""FrontFour"", ""post"": ""Put him in coach."", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""2nd,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""7:07"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""JustOneGame"", ""post"": ""Shaq is a nice dude.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/liam-coen-screwing-with-linebackers-heads/|Liam Coen Screwing With Linebackers’ Heads|OK, no Bucs fan wants Liam Coen to leave Tampa Bay. But Joe wouldn’t blame the man for chasing his professional dream. Some NFL analysts rave about how Coen schemes guys open or schemes open spaces for running backs to blast through. Here is an example: Former NFL offensive lineman and current NFL Network talking head Brian Baldinger does a wonderful job on Twitter breaking down plays for guys like to Joe to inhale. Fun stuff. Below, Coen has Rachaad White lined up behind Tristan Wirfs and Ben Bredeson. He has Bucky Irving lined up behind Cody Mauch and Luke Goedeke. In this play with Baker Mayfield in shotgun, everybody is on a crossing pattern. White runs behind Wirfs and Bredeson who are pulling right. Irving cuts left with Graham Barton, Mauch and Goedeke slicing to the left. Both White and Irving cross in front of Mayfield. Who is going where? Who is getting the ball? Baldinger just loves this play design. If not for a diving D.J. Wonnum, who trips up Bucky for a seven-yard gain, who knows how far that play would have gone? Baldinger is impressed. “There is a moment of indecision at that mesh,” Baldinger said of the Stinking Panthers’ defense. “It’s not easy on the defense.” When you have a good offensive line and a good running back, all it sometimes takes is for the defense to freeze, if but for an instant, for a guy like Bucky to take advantage. All because of how Coen designs a simple run play.|2025-01-02 03:45:00|256|18|6|Liam Coen|Coen impresses with creative play designs for offensive success.|2|Mixed feelings expressed, leaning towards frustration and disappointment with team decisions.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""MadMax"", ""post"": ""put x. c o m instead of twitter in the link, that makes it work \ud83d\ude09"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""2nd,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""4:44"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Joe in Michigan"", ""post"": ""If the Bucs let a good OC leave the building to keep a subpar HC/DC, I\u2019ll be p!ssed."", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""2nd,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""5:45"", ""am""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""BucU"", ""post"": ""\u201c\u201dIf the Bucs let a good OC leave the building to keep a subpar HC/DC, I\u2019ll be p!ssed.\u201d\u201d"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""2nd,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""6:38"", ""am""]}, ""commenter3"": {""username"": ""lambchop"", ""post"": ""@Joe in Michigan,"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""2nd,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""6:44"", ""am""]}, ""commenter4"": {""username"": ""FrontFour"", ""post"": ""Great post, Joe.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/we-want-to-give-it-to-the-fans/|“We Want To Give It To The Fans”|The holiday season may be over (what a drag) but that doesn’t mean the Bucs aren’t in a giving mood. At least, that is what Zyon McCollum said. McCollum acted yesterday like New Year’s Day was Christmas Eve. But then again, he’s always wearing that big smile. So maybe he wasn’t in a holiday mood? McCollum admitted there is a lot of buzz at One Buc Palace this week because Sunday’s win-and-in game against the slimy Saints has a playoff feel. He said one reason there is electricity in the air at Bucs HQ is the team still has that holiday giving mood. Knowing the magnitude of Sunday’s game, McCollum said the Bucs sees it as a gift opportunity Bucs loyalists. “We want to give [another home game] to the fans and give it to the city of Tampa,” McCollum said. “To be able to clinch at home is a big deal. “To be able to clinch a division and to seal [another home game] and to stay at home, it’s big time.” That is big time. While the Bucs are not a dominant home team, players would much rather have a playoff game than at a frozen NFC North city. The way the Bucs played in Los Angeles three weeks ago and stomped out the Chargers, Joe wouldn’t think going back to the City of Angels would be such a terrible task.|2025-01-02 00:00:00|233|14|8|Zyon McCollum|Bucs aim to clinch home game for fans.|6|Mixed sentiments with hope and doubts about playoffs.
