https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/trey-hendrickson-officially-in-play/|Trey Hendrickson Officially In Play|Joe is confident the reigning NFL sacks leader could help the Bucs’ edge rush. That man is Trey Hendrickson of the Bengals. And if you think he got lucky with 17 1/2 sacks in 2023, well, Hendrickson did it again last season. Today, per NFL.com and other outlets, the Bengals granted Hendrickson permission to seek a trade. Joe sure hopes the Bucs are on Hendrickson’s list, and that Buccaneers Ring of Honor general manager Jason Licht is eager to take a phone call. Would Hendrickson want to play for the Bucs? He’s from Orlando, grew up in Apopka and went to Florida Atlantic. Considering the Dolphins have a stable of edge rushers and the Jaguars have a young, double-digit edge rusher (back-to-back seasons), the Bucs sure seem like Hendrickson’s best Florida fit. And if he wants to play for a contender that has a beastly inside pass rush to complement him, the Bucs make a lot of sense. Hendrickson is set to earn $16 million this year, the final season of his contract. He turns 31 in December and is looking for a fatter deal. Hendrickson is a ferocious beast. There’s no spinning the film. He even threw in a whopping 36 quarterback hits and 6 passes defensed last season. How badly do the Bucs want a stud edge rusher that likely could be had for a first-round draft pick or less? It seems Joe and fellow fans are about to find out.|2025-03-06 18:29:00|243|79|7|Trey Hendrickson|Bengals edge rusher potentially traded to Buccaneers.|7|Mixed opinions on acquiring Hendrickson, with concerns about draft capital and salary cap implications.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""ATrain"", ""post"": ""Will The Bucs give up the top pick"", ""post_time"": [""March"", ""6th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""6:33"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Gbobucsfan"", ""post"": ""Just not JL\u2019s style\u2026\u2026hope it happens but don\u2019t see it"", ""post_time"": [""March"", ""6th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""6:33"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""Bucsfan951"", ""post"": ""Ok, this has my full attention and support.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/contract-year-focus/|Contract-Year Focus|Remember when Buccaneers Ring of Honor general manager Jason Licht talked about how some players “need a carrot” in front of them to achieve greatness? Joe is not saying beastly Bucs right tackle Luke Goedeke is that guy, but he is entering a contract year and Joe has been told Goedeke is laser-focused on having a monster season. Goedeke was fantastic last year when not sitting out five games with a concussion. A workaholic reputation follows Goedeke at One Buc Palace. Attend training camp and you’ll see Goedeke glued to real-time practice film. He’s not the guy who waits to watch it after practice. Building his body? Tristan Wirfs will tell you Goedeke is stronger than he is, and Joe may always remember Cody Mauch telling a story on the Buccaneers Radio Network last year about how Goedeke arrives at the weekly offensive line dinner with food — and eating it. Keep in mind the dinner is at a restaurant and linemen gorge intentionally with a teammate often picking up the tab. After hearing how hard Goedeke is preparing and plans to prepare for 2025, Joe wonders again if Graham Barton’s comments about a possibly imminent new Goedeke contract were born from knowledge versus speculation.|2025-03-06 13:02:00|205|21|8|Luke Goedeke|Contract-year focus on having a monster season|6|Mixed sentiment with concerns about concussions and contract extensions, but overall positive views.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Matt_PcAfee"", ""post"": ""Picturing Luke showing up at Ruth Chris and pulls a hoagie out of his pocket is hilarious"", ""post_time"": [""March"", ""6th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""1:08"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""View from 132"", ""post"": ""Hard to stomach guys making millions need an incentive of additional millions to bring their best to the field."", ""post_time"": [""March"", ""6th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""1:14"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""WiscoJoe"", ""post"": ""Him being a Wisco guy and reading this brings me joy\u2026 expect nothing less."", ""post_time"": [""March"", ""6th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""1:15"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter3"": {""username"": ""SlyPirate"", ""post"": ""Love Goe but that concussion was scary. +1 month in concussion protocol.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/light-on-chances-big-on-results/|Light On Chances, Big On Results|BY IRA KAUFMAN Driven, competitive, aggressive, tough, leader. Buc fans know all the adjectives used to describe Baker Mayfield. Let’s add one more — opportunistic. If the 2025 Bucs can address their defensive issues, the biggest beneficiary will be No. 6, who did more with less than any quarterback in the league last fall. That’s not a knock on the talent surrounding Mayfield. Instead, it’s a recognition that Tampa Bay’s offense needs more opportunities to shine. The Buc defense had difficulty getting off the field last season, a problem that peaked during the opening-round playoff loss to Washington. In that 23-20 setback, the Commanders reeled off 69 offensive snaps to only 44 for the home team. That’s a staggering discrepancy, but it’s hardly an outlier. For the season, the Buc offense was on the field for 181 drives. Only 10 teams had fewer possessions. Consider what Mayfield accomplished in those circumstances: Only three teams had a better scoring percentage per drive than Tampa Bay. Only two teams registered more yards per drive. Only the Chiefs spent more average time per drive. What helped the Bucs maximize their chances? Start on third down, where Tampa Bay ranked No. 1 among 32 teams. How about the red zone? Mayfield’s numbers grew when the field shrunk as he completed an NFL-best 73 percent of his throws, with 29 TD passes and one interception. “He’s one of those quarterbacks that has that mentality in his head that he’ll do whatever it takes to win,” says Todd Bowles. “He’s determined to win. A lot of guys have developed that mentality because of him and we really like that.” As good as Mayfield was last season — and he was very good — it’s not unreasonable to believe he can be even better this fall. He doesn’t turn 30 until April, so he should be approaching his prime. He’s healthy and he just proved he can keep the league’s No. 4 scoring offense humming, even with Chris Godwin sidelined. Before Godwin went down with a dislocated ankle in Week 7, he looked like the NFL’s best receiver as the Bucs averaged 30 points. In the final 10 games, Tampa averaged 29 points as Mayfield kept the chains moving with his arm and his legs. Mayfield’s consistency was remarkable in 2024. The Bucs led all teams by averaging 6.7 points in the opening quarter. In 2022, with Tom Brady under center for all 17 games, Tampa Bay averaged 2.8 points in the first 15 minutes. Only three teams were less prolific at the start. Turning to the fourth quarter last season, Mayfield led the league in passer rating, completing 72.5 percent of his throws, with 12 TDs and two picks. New offensive coordinator Josh Grizzard is operating under a stressful mandate … don’t screw up a good thing. We all know Mayfield had a heavy hand in deciding who would replace Liam Coen, who will soon realize Trevor Lawrence is no Baker Mayfield. “It means the world to me,” Grizzard says of Mayfield’s hearty endorsement. “He’s been fantastic.” Imagine what Mayfield can be if the Buc defense plays complementary football and gives this offense more chances to light up the scoreboard? The Bucs scored on four of their seven possessions against the Commanders, converting 56 percent on third down. It wasn’t good enough because rookie Jayden Daniels helped Washington go 8-for-15 on the money down. Tampa Bay’s embattled defense was on the field for more than 35 minutes. All eyes will be on Grizzard as he calls plays for a potent attack. Now it’s up to the other side of the ball to maximize Mayfield’s opportunities. He’ll take care of the rest.|2025-03-06 12:11:00|615|24|7|Baker Mayfield|Mayfield's potential shines with defensive improvement and offensive opportunities.|3|Mixed sentiment about defense upgrades and Mayfield's impact on the team's future success.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Joseph C Simmons"", ""post"": ""It must be so difficult to keep an NFL roster \u2018balanced\u2019 with adequate talent in every position group.

Joe brought word yesterday of how Bowles believes there are good inside linebackers in the draft, just not that many at the top. In short, Bowles said in the same media availability at the combine in Indianapolis, it all boils down to knowing what you are looking for and where to find it. So in the big picture, what experts say about a position in the draft doesn’t matter. Bowles used running back Bucky Irving as proof. “Oh yeah, [I’m] very happy,” Bowles said of Bucky’s rookie season. “This is a good running backs draft so it kind of goes to show you, last year we didn’t think it was as deep but we hit a home run. “It doesn’t matter in a draft if the experts or the pundits are saying it’s very strong or weak at a certain position. You can still find a great player.” The past two years, the Bucs have been uncanny at finding players on the third day of the draft. They’ve also been strong drafting on the first two days.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/truth-or-fiction-surrounding-chris-godwin/|Truth Or Fiction Surrounding Chris Godwin?|While this is classified as an NFL Scouting Combine rumor by the guy reporting it, Joe is sharing to offer perspective. NBC fantasy football guru/studio analyst Matthew Berry penned “the top-25 rumors I heard at the NFL Combine” for NBCSports.com. No. 11 was about pending Bucs free agent receiver Chris Godwin. There’s nothing really new here except for an interesting throwaway line from Berry that may not be accurate. 11. Tampa Bay desperately wants Chris Godwin back. After suffering a serious injury last year leaving his availability at the start of the season in question, I was expecting a one year “prove it” deal for Godwin. But I’m told there is a competitive market for his services and he’ll get a multi-year deal with some guaranteed money. And he’s likely to get it from Tampa, which really wants him back. They love Godwin and so does Baker. So Berry says Godwin’s availability for “the start of the season is in question?” That’s not what Joe heard, so Joe is skeptical. Perhaps Berry was referring to Godwin’s perceived status at the time of the gruesome injury? Regardless, the Bucs stressed greatly at the Combine, rightfully so, that Godwin’s dislocated ankle is a major injury. With any major injury there are question marks, and it’s not like fans can see Godwin workout videos online to assess his health. Has he run yet? Joe wouldn’t bet on it. So it’s a question mark how much Buccaneers Ring of Honor general manager Jason Licht and Team Glazer are willing to wager on Godwin being worth his market value, a number that’s also unclear. Before the Combine started, Joe was told Godwin will find a healthy free agent market but at nowhere near the salary some fans are speculating. Then Matt Lombardo reported that agents are rumbling about Godwin possibly getting a two-year deal for $26 million, aka DeAndre Hopkins money. Joe just hopes the Godwin mystery is solved before he’s free to sign with another team on Wednesday.|2025-03-06 08:52:00|334|37|3|Chris Godwin|Rumors on Godwin's future with Tampa Bay Buccaneers.|6|Mixed opinions on Godwin's health, contract value, team's cap space, and coaching decisions.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Allen Lofton"", ""post"": ""If Godwin is completely healthy why isn\u2019t he calling a conference to demonstrate it for the media and GM\u2019s.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/gerald-mccoy-urging-jason-licht-to-sign-freshly-unemployed-joey-bosa/|Gerald McCoy Urging Jason Licht To Sign Freshly Unemployed Joey Bosa|Joe is confident that when former Bucs six-time Pro Bowler Gerald McCoy takes to Twitter and uses Bucs AC/DC-loving general manager Jason Licht’s name, that post gets the attention of shot-callers at One Buc Palace. And as much as Joe agrees with GMC about not just a team need, but a massive hole at a make-or-break position, Joe can’t agree with GMC on this player. This offseason GMC has been very vocal on social media begging, pleading, egging on Licht to break down and go get a proven pass rusher. Joe is in lockstep with GMC. First, GMC begged Licht to trade for All-Pro defensive end Myles Garrett. GMC’s logic was sound: A first-round pick (which would likely be the starting ransom for Garrett) has a 50 percent chance of making it in the NFL. GMC wisely added that Garrett is “100 percent.” Can’t argue with that. But last night GMC wasted little time after news moved that Chargers defensive end Joey Bosa was released. Yes, Joe wants a proven quarterback assault artist. Just not that badly. Bosa, once upon a time, was a dangerous man. In four of his first six seasons in San Diego, Bosa was a double-digit sack guy. Then Bosa became brittle. Through the last three years, Bosa’s highest sack total for a season was 6.5 in 2023 and he’s averaged just nine games played. Jamel Dean laughs at that number. To make matters worse, Bosa will soon be a 30-year old brittle defensive end/outside linebacker. NFL teams aren’t exactly lining up for those guys, no matter the player’s last name. If the Bucs gamble on an injury-prone outside linebacker, Joe would rather see them pick up Giants free agent Azeez Ojulari, who is six years younger than Bosa and would likely be considerably cheaper. If Ojulari suddenly becomes dependable, hey, you may have the next Shaq Barrett. This isn’t the first time GMC has tried to link Joey Bosa to the Bucs. Joe loves how GMC is fed up with a lack of an edge rush and is trying to will Licht to pull a trigger. Joe’s not on board with the Joey Bosa Express.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/it-was-the-most-gut-wrenching-week-of-my-life/|“It Was The Most Gut-Wrenching Week Of My Life”|We finally get to hear Liam Coen’s side of the story. Bucs fans are still peeved at Coen, the former Bucs offensive coordinator, because of how he left town seemingly in the dark of the night to have a clandestine meeting with the Jags and the team’s bungling owner Shad Con Khan. Coen had a deal for a massive raise with the Bucs if he stayed. He verbally agreed to it. The contract was on his desk. But the morning he was supposed to sign, Coen was instead in Jacksonville, interviewing for the Jags job that Khan tried to keep a secret to dodge the Rooney Rule. Last week at the combine, Coen did a sitdown for Barstool Sports‘ “Pardon My Take” podcast co-hosted by Big Cat and PFT Commenter. (Yes, those are aliases). During the sitdown, Barstool Sports personality and Bucs superfan Steven Cheah grilled Coen about why he left and the circumstances surrounding the departure. You could tell Coen didn’t really want to talk about it and either seemed depressed or embarrassed, or both. He seemed to have had the vibe that he got ambushed about how he got the job. But the Barstool Gang gave Coen a forum to explain. “But ultimately, it came down to new information,” Coen said of what changed from his first Zoom meeting with Khan — to agreeing to a new Bus contract and having a clandestine in-person meeting with Khan. “New information became available. When you’re going to buy a house and you figure out, like, it’s either not as good or better than you thought. And some of the people that ultimately kind of helped me throughout this journey, like at the end of day [said], ‘You’re allowed to change your mind.’ “It’s kind of, life.” Coen added that the days leading up to his decision tore him up. “It was the most gut-wrenching week of my life,” Coen said. “It was.” Coen added he understood where Cheah and Bucs fans were coming from and understood how and why many Bucs fans consider him Public Enemy No. 1. Coen added he went from being a popular guy among young Bucs fans in his subdivision to being hated by the very same fans over his departure to Jacksonville. “You sound like a lot of the boys in my neighborhood,” Coen told Cheah. “They are die-hard [Bucs] fans. They are p!ssed at me. They were p!ssed. They are cool now. We’re good.” In the wake of taking the job at Jacksonville, Coen said he came to peace with his decision thanks to the Bucs. Coen said he FaceTimed weeks ago with Baker Mayfield and Bucs offensive linemen from their tropical vacation and they were genuinely happy for him. When Coen said he ran into Todd Bowles, it was all hugs.|2025-03-06 03:55:00|468|51|'7|Liam Coen|Coen discusses gut-wrenching decision to leave Bucs for Jags.'|4|Mixed reactions to Coen's departure, understanding but some criticism.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/chris-godwin-is-a-popular-man-on-social-media/|Chris Godwin Is A Popular Man On Social Media|So as Joe sometimes searches a Bucs player on social media to see if something out there on a guy somehow missed Joe’s radar. And the following sure got past Joe’s antennae. Bucs receiver Chris Godwin is a very, very popular guy on Twitter. So Joe searched his name and for a five-hour window that preceded Joe’s search, Joe swears fans of half the teams in the NFL made a case for their team to sign Godwin next week when the free agency dinner bell rings. That is, if Godwin even gets on the open market. The Bucs have until March 12 — Wednesday — to sign Godwin to avoid taking a large salary cap hit that was due to kick in last month. Joe is guessing these same NFL fans are not aware of the injury Godwin is trying to overcome. Or maybe they believe Godwin is already healed. Good teams, rotten teams, average teams, their fans want Godwin. For example, Joe saw two posts where Patriots fans are convinced Godwin is coming to New England. Why would Godwin go there? He’d be playing for a meathead defensive coach on a terrible team with an offensive coordinator that has proven twice to be a lousy coach unless he was calling plays for Tom Brady. Hell, even Brady made Byron Leftwich look good. Again, Joe was tipped off by an NFL suit last week in Indianapolis that Godwin isn’t going to get close to the $20+ million a year contract many outside the NFL world think he will receive. Why? It’s due to his age and injuries, Joe was told. Then, former Giants and Eagles beat guy Matt Lombardo had an agent tell him Godwin will likely be signing a $13 million a year contract. So if Godwin stays in Tampa, it appears the Bucs are getting a hometown discount thanks to Godwin’s injuries and a weak market for his services. Throw in the fact it appears a couple of strong receivers are now available (Seattle’s Tyler Lockett was cut yesterday and then his teammate DK Metcalf said he wanted out), that further flooded the receivers market.|2025-03-06 00:00:00|357|18|7|Chris Godwin|NFL teams interested in signing Godwin|4|Mixed sentiment with concerns about Godwin's future, value, and potential destinations among fans.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""BillyBucco"", ""post"": ""Don\u2019t get me wrong, I love Godwin and I do want him back, but I think it\u2019s time to truly address the position.
