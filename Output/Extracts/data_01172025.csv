NFL Network, of course, is covering the array of NFL head coaching openings as if it’s a presidential primary. Bucs fans are paying attention because Tampa Bay offensive coordinator Liam Coen interviewed for the Jacksonville head coaching job. He’s the young architect of the Bucs’ top-5 offense. Tonight, NFL Network insider Ian Rapoport shared a report on X updating the Cowboys and Jaguars head coaching searches. Per Rapoport, Jacksonville has now interviewed eight candidates and Lions defensive coordinator Aaron Glenn and Lions offensive coordinator Ben Johnson are “names to watch.” He said “both are considered to be very high up as to where the Jaguars go and what we like.” Hey, Coen wasn’t mentioned. Joe liked the sound of that. There have been no reports of Coen interviewing with other teams. Former Bucs offensive coordinator and current Ravens playcaller Todd Monken also is in the Jacksonville mix.|2025-01-17 19:32:00|159|52|3|Liam Coen|Liam Coen not top choice for Jaguars coaching position.|4|Mixed sentiment with some optimism and some criticism.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""ModHairKen"", ""post"": ""Stay brother.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/national-chatter-continues-regarding-todd-bowles-job-security/|National Chatter Continues Regarding Todd Bowles’ Job Security|This kind of stuff happens, especially when the highest tiers of Bucs management fail to clear the air.  Is Todd Bowles safe in his job for 2025? Joe has said emphatically that he is. Sage of Tampa Bay Sports Ira Kaufman has reported the same. Buccaneers Ring of Honor general manager Jason Licht praised the Bucs’ “great coaching” this season before kickoff Sunday against the Commanders. Oh yeah, and the Bucs won the NFC South for the third consecutive year under Bowles. Still, respected national analysts continue a drumbeat questioning whether Bowles has firm ground under him. Sports Illustrated NFL insider columnist Albert Breer, a guy Licht talks to every year, spoke out yesterday during a YouTube mailbag segment. Breer was asked if “there’s any chance Todd Bowles is fired?” and “will the Bucs really let Liam Coen leave the building? Breer’s opening response? “I think this is a fair question to ask.” Breer continued: “Todd Bowles is on a four-year deal. This is one of those critical junctures in his contract where it’s, ‘Ok, like now, do you extend him?'” You don’t want to send a head coach into a contract year, Breer added. “Being at this juncture in the contract can force some of these hard discussions, and I think that’s part of where they’re at right now,” Breer said. Joe will jump in and say it’s Joe’s understanding that Bowles has a fifth-year team option in his contract. What that actually means, Joe has no clue. Breer said he thinks Bowles will be the 2025 head coach and suggested the Bucs will “do some sort of Band-Aid extension with Todd.” Perhaps that means executing his fifth-year option now? Regardless, Joe wonders why — for this pre-planned, pre-recorded segment — didn’t Breer just text Licht and ask for an answer and then share it. Perhaps he did? Perhaps he got no response? Perhaps Breer was just lazy. Breer suggested the Bucs under Bowles have shown a ceiling as a top-8 team and the team has had discussions about what will change that. That brings Joe to Mike Florio, the NBC Sports insider who has spoken directly with Baker Mayfield multiple times this season. Florio was on The Rich Eisen Show yesterday saying he thinks Bowles deserves another year but it’s plausible that Team Glazer will pull the rug out from under Bowles because of ownership history and other factors. Maybe, just maybe, somebody at One Buc Palace will ask Adam Schefter or Ian Rapoport to post two sentences on social media saying Bowles is 100 percent the 2025 head coach.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/todd-bowles-deflects-antoine-winfield-health-question/|Todd Bowles Deflects Antoine Winfield Health Question|One sad note to the Bucs’ division-winning season was star safety Antoine Winfield, Jr. having an off year. It happens. But Joe’s real sadness is thinking about how Winfield injured his foot in Week 1 with the Bucs’ victory already locked up. He didn’t have to be on the field. Garbage time turned into crisis time. Winfield missed the next four games and never seemed to be the same player Bucs fans were used to seeing. Winfield also missed the final four regular season games after messing up his knee early in the Week 14 Raiders game. Joe asked Todd Bowles this week whether Winfield “was ever 100 percent after Week 1?” Bowles didn’t have a straight answer. “I couldn’t answer that personally, but I would venture to say I’m sure everybody played hurt a lot,” Bowles said. ‘But when he’s healthy, you can see it. I think once he got healthy he got injured again. So it kind of impacted a little bit.” Joe’s not sure why Bowles said he couldn’t answer the question. As the defensive playcaller, he needed to know Winfield’s health status each week because it’s tied to what Bowles might ask him to do on the field. Joe goes to bed at night assuming Winfield was hurt since Week 1 and will come back in April as the All-Pro he was last season. Joe can’t fathom what a faction of Bucs fans assert: that Winfield’s play fell off because he got a fat new contract.|2025-01-17 14:25:00|250|28|2|Todd Bowles|Winfield's injury struggles impact Bucs' season outlook.|3|Mixed sentiment with concerns about Winfield's performance post-contract and injuries, countered by support and optimism.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""BallHawk75"", ""post"": ""@Joe"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""17th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""2:40"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""TheBucsAnthem"", ""post"": ""Just like the Shaun Alexander contract\u2026\u2026dude gets paid big time,  but was never the same player again"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""17th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""2:44"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""OHBucFan"", ""post"": ""I\u2019d say Bowles is coming from the viewpoint of there\u2019s a difference between ready to play and being 100%.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/cody-mauch-improvement-lauded/|Cody Mauch Improvement Lauded|Forget Mike Evans, Buccaneers Ring of Honor general manager Jason Licht has his own streak. It’s finding quality offensive lineman at schools big and small. Fans from Palm Harbor to Polk County were looking for right guard Cody Mauch to improve in his sophomore season, and he got the job done. The 2023 second-round pick out of North Dakota State drew major love from his head coach this week as Todd Bowles evaluated him on the Buccaneers Radio Network. “He doesn’t get a lot of credit, either,” Bowles said of Mauch. “His first year to second year, he’s grown.” Bowles gushing about the huge improvement in right tackle Luke Goedeke, a 2022 second-round pick out of Central Michigan, and noted that when it came to development this season, Mauch was right there with him. “Luke is No. 1. Cody is 1A,” Bowles said. The PFF Tribe also is the Mauch train, labeling him the Bucs’ most improved player, per their flawed grading system. Cody Mauch struggled in his first season in the NFL, he was inserted into the Buccaneers’ lineup as their starting right guard from Day 1 and looked off the pace for large stretches of the season. He allowed 48 pressures and seven sacks, earning a 44.7 grade in 1,102 offensive snaps. Improvement was needed across the board, and Mauch delivered in 2024. The former No. 49 overall pick was excellent in his second season, allowing a 2.7% pressure rate, the sixth-lowest among all guards, and his total pressures allowed dropped to just 18, which was 30 fewer than just a year ago. Mauch’s overall grade improved to 75.4, the 15th-highest among guards in 2024. The improvement after just one year has been remarkable. Joe likes the eye test. Mauch added weight last offseason and he played stronger, Joe believes. The way the Bucs were running the ball, clearly there was no huge weak link on the line, and Mauch is athletic when he pulls. If left guard Ben Bredeson leaves in free agency, Joe has no doubt that Licht will fill the whole successfully, through the draft or with last year’s sixth-round pick Elijah Klein.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/todd-bowles-players-cannot-rest-on-the-past/|Todd Bowles: Players Cannot Rest On The Past|Joe reads this a fair amount from commenters on this here corner of the interwebs.  And Joe is in the very same boat. Joe looks at the Bucs young roster and thinks, if the powers that be can only fix the pass defense, this team could be very dangerous next season. So many current players should improve. On Monday, head Todd Bowles said there is a very large speed bump in that line of thinking. “It helps only if they help themselves get better,” Bowles said. “The concentration part – them working out in the offseason, coming back in shape and being prepared will help us a great deal next year.” Now that’s a great point. Players often make a jump — sometimes a big jump — from their rookie seasons to their second year. As Joe likes to say, a full offseason in an NFL weightroom can do wonders (right guard Cody Mauch is a really good example). So imagine Graham Barton getting better this offseason, Bucky Irving, Jalen McMillan, Tykee Smith, Devin Culp. Their progression could improve the team a lot. But, as Bowles noted, if they don’t work at it from now until July, it won’t happen.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/todd-bowles-addresses-vita-vea-route-running/|Todd Bowles Addresses Vita Vea Route Running|Not good enough. Yeah, Vita Vea went out for touchdown pass Sunday night and appeared to be the first option on the play based on watching Baker Mayfield’s head — and the words from Todd Bowles’ mouth. The head coach addressed the third-quarter red zone play on the Buccaneers Radio Network. “The route running leaves a little bit to be desired,” Bowles said of Vea. “He has outstanding hands. I think he’s going to have to get down to about 245 to be a very good route runner. … It was something we tried that we saw on film. It just didn’t work out for us.” Mayfield ate a sack on the first-down play, but thankfully the Bucs scored on a TD pass to Bucky Irving on the next snap, putting them up 17-13. Joe likes when Vea enters the game on offense, but Joe would rather see him blocking or taking a handoff. Regardless, it was a fun play. If Vea had caught a touchdown, The Licht House would have erupted and been buzzing at an incredible level.|2025-01-17 08:59:00|179|19|4|Vita Vea|Vea's route running criticized by Todd Bowles after failed play.|3|Mixed reactions, with some negativity towards the decisions made, but also some positive remarks.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""BuckyBuc"", ""post"": ""they shouldve ran it with vita"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""17th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""9:33"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""SB~LV"", ""post"": ""Insulting to the defense Stupid play Wasted play"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""17th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""9:59"", ""am""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""heyjude"", ""post"": ""Would have loved Vea making a TD.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/made-for-each-other/|Made For Each Other|If Bucs Super Bowl-winning coach Bucco Bruce Arians was the quarterback whisperer, then Bucs offensive coordinator Liam Coen is the Baker Mayfield whisperer. Late in the 2022 season, Mayfield’s career bottomed out in Carolina. The Browns had washed their hands of him and whored themselves out for a skunk like Deshaun Watson. #Fail Then Mayfield (and Sam Darnold) wound up on Matt Rhule’s roster in Carolina. That organization was a complete and total mess and the Stinking Panthers released Mayfield. Sitting on the NFL scrap heap, the Rams came calling in desperation. Mayfield had only hours to prepare for the Raiders on a Thursday night. Mayfield played pretty well. And linking up with then-Rams offensive coordinator Liam Coen seemed to turn around Mayfield, or at least get his head above water. He came to the Bucs and had a Pro Bowl solid season. Then this past year, Coen is reunited with Mayfield and Mayfield exploded with his best year in the NFL. Diante Lee of The Ringer was so impressed, he thinks Mayfield has grown into a top-10 quarterback. Not bad for a guy who was left along the NFL road like an abandoned kitten. Even if you had told me that offensive coordinator Liam Coen would keep [the Bucs’] offense steady in 2024, there’s no way I would have imagined his scheme would make quarterback Baker Mayfield look even better than he did last season. Coen gave Mayfield plenty of easy answers with screens and quick passes off play-action, but as injuries piled up at receiver and defenses tried to take those short passes away, we saw Mayfield aggressively attack downfield. He played like one of the 10 best quarterbacks in the league this season… Joe is firmly convinced Mayfield and Coen have only scratched the surface. Think about it: With the exception of Mayfield, this offense was fully new to the Bucs. For example, last year when Dave Canales came in, Mike Evans told Joe in mid-December, after the Bucs beat the Packers in Green Bay, that he and his teammates were still learning Canales’ offense. So Joe thinks it’s safe to say the Bucs probably haven’t digested Coen’s complete arsenal yet. Think about how much more efficient if not more dangerous this offense could be next season, especially if Chris Godwin returns. Bucky Irving will be better. Graham Barton will be better — provided Coen doesn’t flee for a head coaching gig.|2025-01-17 07:00:00|405|23|9|Baker Mayfield|Mayfield's resurgence under Coen impresses|6|Mixed sentiments with hope for improvement, concerns about defense, and varying opinions on key players.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Beeej"", ""post"": ""Todd Monken is ALSO interviewing with JAC, I\u2019d expect they\u2019d go with him over Liam"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""17th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""7:07"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""ModHairKen"", ""post"": ""Re-sign Godwin.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/todd-bowles-and-time-management/|Todd Bowles And Time Management|Is Bucs coach Todd Bowles the perfect coach? No. His lack of aggressiveness with his offense at certain points leaves Joe’s mouth agape. And his insistence on using pass rushers in pass coverage drives Joe mental — especially when his defense’s hallmark the past three years has been no edge rush in a passing league. And folks wonder why the pass defense is terrible. Over at BSPN, follicly-challenged Billy Barnwell of BSPN makes a case that Bowles is a “successful” coach. But Barnwell then jumps deep into the pool of what many Bucs fans scream about: clock management. Joe is getting worn out by this charge. With all the math geeks and stat nerds who prattle and type endlessly about football minutiae, can one of these MIT professor wannabes come up with a time management plan that is foolproof? If they have, Joe hasn’t seen it. Joe doesn’t believe there is one, and that’s why Joe doesn’t bark a whole lot about this with Bowles. Bill Belichick went on Pat McAfee’s show recently and gave his take on how and when to use timeouts. Seemed pretty insightful. Then a week or so later, Tom Brady gave his take on the subject during a FOX NFL broadcast and his philosophy was polar opposite of Belichick’s. The late George Allen often said his goal was to get to the two-minute warning with three timeouts. If he had to use a timeout before the two-minute warning, someone screwed up somewhere and the buck ultimately stopped on his desk. Barnwell cited only one example of bad clock management from Bowles. Baker Mayfield was already behind center when a timeout was used. Barnwell knocked Bowles for waiting 10 seconds Sunday to call timeout, having wasted the time. But did Bowles really waste the time? Barnwell provides no context. Did Bowles think the play was doomed for a pick the way Washington’s defense began to line up? Did the Bucs have the wrong personnel on the field to matchup? Did Mayfield have the wrong formation? Those would have been valid reasons for Bowles to call a timeout when he did, so Joe isn’t sure Barnwell was fair in this specific example. If you need to stop the clock, it’s smart to use a timeout right before the two-minute warning. Then you have two clock stoppages close together. And Joe also likes to have at least one timeout in the final 10 seconds in case you need to set up for a field goal or a desperation play. If an offense is sharp and schooled correctly, it can control the clock without timeouts using the sidelines effectively and spiking snaps on first downs, and using no-huddles and hurry-up offenses. Without a proven formula or a masterplan on the correct way to use timeouts, then all this constant barking about clock management (with just about every coach, not just Bowles) is starting to reach the level of hollering about an offensive line just to holler. Does this mean Bowles manages the clock precisely? No. Joe just thinks there are bigger fish to fry with this team.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/bucky-irving-no-10/|Bucky Irving No. 10|Joe doesn’t think it is crazy to suggest that if not for Bucky Irving, the Bucs wouldn’t have made the playoffs. Thanks to a couple of galling road losses, specifically the choke job in Atlanta where soon-to-be-benched Kirk Cousins charbroiled the rotten Bucs pass defense for an obscene 500 yards, the Bucs had painted themselves into a corner. The Bucs pretty much had to run the table after the bye to make the playoffs or get help. After falling to the modern-day Jim Kelly, Cooper Rush in Dallas, the Bucs needed help. And they got it from of all teams, the Commandos, who returned the favor last Sunday night in The Licht House. Along the way in the desperate stretch of Bucs wins, rookie running back Irving at times put the Bucs offense on his back. It was awesome to see. Very few times has Joe seen a Bucs running back weave his way through defenses the way Bucky had. Bucky was so good that former NFL running back and current NFL Network talking head Maurice Jones-Drew ranked Bucky as his No. 10 running back in the league. He gave Bucky credit for helping the Bucs get to the postseason. Irving has been an exceptional playmaker for Liam Coen’s offense, one who got better and better as the season progressed. In fact, Irving had the third-most scrimmage yards (834) in the league in Weeks 12-18, behind only Saquon Barkley and Jahmyr Gibbs. He’s a huge reason why the Bucs made a late-season push to earn their fifth straight playoff appearance. This rookie’s future is bright. If a running back is putting up Barkley numbers, that is incredible. Way to go Bucky! If the Bucs get Chris Godwin back in free agency — the free agency dinner bell rings in less than two months — what do the Bucs draft on offense? Anyone? If Godwin comes back, there are no holes on offense. If the Bucs draft nothing but defensive players, Joe won’t lose any sleep over it.|2025-01-17 00:00:00|337|29|8|Bucky Irving|Bucs playoff push led by exceptional rookie running back.|6|Mixed sentiment with some optimism around Bucky and team improvements, but also some concerns.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Oxycondomns"", ""post"": ""tyreke keeps posting about the bucs"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""17th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""12:16"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Pryda30"", ""post"": ""We absolutely need a pass rusher in FA!
