https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/buccaneers-have-night-issues/|Buccaneers Have Night Issues|Don’t tell anyone, but the Bucs have lost their last five night games in the regular season. That includes three this season and two last year. Sandwiched in between is last season’s playoff victory at night against the Eagles. There’s something about the Bucs with Todd Bowles and night games. There was no winning record in prime time with Tom Brady at quarterback in 2022, either. Joe brings this up because the Bucs play tomorrow — at night. The Sunday Night Football affair at Dallas is not a must-win game, but it certainly is critical. If the Bucs win out — at Dallas (6-8) and home for Carolina (3-11) and New Orleans (5-9) — then they’ll lock up the No. 3 seed in the NFC playoffs with a record of 11-6. A hiccup along the way and a lot could change. Joe hopes and expects that Bowles will try to tweak something tomorrow as it relates to game preparation. It’s hard to believe Tampa Bay’s woes at night are only tied to bad luck a higher-caliber of opponent. Coincidences are rare in the NFL. So Joe takes a little comfort in the Bucs being 5-2 on the road this season with both losses coming in overtime — each at night.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/energy-hustle-effort-unity/|“Energy. Hustle. Effort. Unity.”|Is it possible to identify the Bucs’ post-bye reason for a four-game winning streak, an 8-6 record and a hold on the No. 3 seed in the NFC postseason? Joe’s got a two-word wiseass answer: Anthony Nelson. That aside, Tampa Bay’s rise is a mixture of quarterback play, outcoaching Jim Harbaugh, a soft schedule, special offensive line play, spectacular individual efforts and healthy cornerbacks and a roster wired to stay focused and press through tough times. “Energy. Hustle. Effort. Unity. That’s what I’m sensing from [the Bucs],” Tony Dungy told Bucs head coach Todd Bowles in a pregame NBC feature for Sunday Night Football. Bowles was in lockstep with Dungy. “That’s all we talk about,” Bowles said. “We bring our own energy. We play for each other. We play with each other, and we let the chips fly. We’re never going to be perfect and football’s not meant to be played perfect. But they play hard, they play fast and they play smart. And that gives us a chance.” If the Bucs play like Bowles says they do, they should have no problem beating Dallas and their backup quarterback on Sunday night.|2024-12-21 12:27:00|192|13|7|Bucs|Buccaneers' positive outlook on recent performance and upcoming game.|5|Varied opinions on Bucs' performance, defense concerns, positive sentiments towards team efforts.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Crickett Baker"", ""post"": ""Yep, if they do.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/short-fields-coming-for-bucs-offense/|Short Fields Coming For Bucs Offense?|Tomorrow night might be a Todd Bowles kind of night. Bowles is a defensive guy. Defensive guys like takeaways. Some, like lousy Lovie Smith, thought takeaways were more important than points or getting your defense off the field. Bowles isn’t that far off the cliff when it comes to takeaways, but he’s big on them. Well, tomorrow night might be his kind of game. It seems if you just looked at the numbers, you’d think America’s Quarterback, Jameis Winston, was playing for the Cowboys. He doesn’t, but the turnovers are coming. Per Rich Hribar of Sharp Football Analysis no team coughs up the ball more frequently than the Cowboys. The Cowboys have turned the ball over on a league-high 20.5 percent of their possessions at home. So every fifth possession the Cowboys play Santa Claus. Cool. Maybe the Bucs can take advantage? And that’s the key. That’s why Joe is firmly convinced takeaways are terribly overblown, but many NFL folks claim the data is overwhelming takeaways lead to wins. It is hardly an absolute and there is way, way, way too much data to show that if you don’t score points off takeaways, they really don’t mean much. For example, Tampa Bay was tied for third with the most takeaways in 2013 under former Bucs commander Greg Schiano. The Bucs won four games. Tom Brady, on the road in the NFC championship game, threw three picks. The Bucs won. And more recently, in his last eight starts, Bears quarterback Caleb Williams hasn’t thrown a pick.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/ready-for-a-playoff-run/|Ready For A Playoff Run|“This is a team no one will want to play.” Joe has heard and read that phrase spoken and written so many times since Sunday that Joe wants to grab a bottle of Bulleit Bourbon frontier whiskey and do a shot every time it’s said. And then make sure to schedule an appointment with a coroner. It seems every NFL analyst breathing has uttered/typed this phase the past week. Prickly Pete Prisco of CBS Sports is no different. He typed a column in the wake of the Bucs’ blowout of the Chargers and explained why he thinks the Bucs have all the right pieces at the right time to make a deep playoff run. If they do [run the table], they’ll win the NFC South [and clinch the No. 3 seed]. Like I said, nobody will want to play this team in the postseason. They can score on anybody and when the defense is healthy, that unit can be really good — a great mix of young and old on that side of the ball. Tampa Bay showed last year it could win with Mayfield and gang in the playoffs. Now they are seasoned some, which should make them even more dangerous this time around. That’s why they have to be considered a team that can go on a run in the playoffs and seem to be getting hot at just the right time. Joe wouldn’t be shocked at all if the Bucs got to the NFC title game, as heard on the Ira Kaufman Podcast. Now Joe’s not saying they will. First, the Bucs have to get to the playoffs. On the flip side Joe also wouldn’t be completely shocked if the Bucs are watching the playoffs on the couch just like you and Joe. Remember: All it takes is for the Dixie Chicks, now just a game back of the Bucs, to be tied with the Bucs and Atlanta wins the division. The next three games will be fun — or one of the biggest nutkicks since the Bucs choked away a win at Atlanta this season.|2024-12-21 07:45:00|349|36|7|Bucs|Optimistic outlook on playoff potential for Tampa Bay Buccaneers.|5|Mixed sentiments with optimism and caution expressed by fans.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Drunk Bucs Fan"", ""post"": ""As much as it hurts, we are all Eagles fans this week.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/tony-dungy-mike-evans-says-he-can-finally-go-deep/|Tony Dungy: Mike Evans Says He Can Finally Go Deep|The NBC Sunday Night Football crew has been busy prepping for its next game, Bucs at Cowboys.  That includes Hall of Fame head coach turned NBC media analyst Tony Dungy. A Tampa local, he was at One Buc Palace this week and shared, via NBC, that Mike Evans told him that his injured hamstring has only just come back to life completely. The comment came during a sitdown with Todd Bowles, who agreed with him emphatically. “When I was out on the field today, he told me this is the part that’s back after the hamstring injury,” Dungy said. “There was a time for a couple of weeks where he couldn’t go deep. Defenders knew that and they were sitting down on him. Now he can go by them.” Bowles was in full agreement. “Now he’s back and he can go by them, and you can see the big plays starting to show and we’re going to need every one of them down the stretch,” Bowles said. Joe is glad to hear Evans thinks he’s now at full strength. In what was a fun display of coachspeak, Bowles said last month that Evans had a full “green light” after his hamstring injury while Buccaneers Ring of Honor general manager Jason Licht said at the same time that Evans was “100 percent.” He wasn’t. Now he is, and that’s sweet music for an already singing Bucs offense.|2024-12-21 01:45:00|236|17|8|Mike Evans|Evans back at full strength for Bucs offense.|7|Fans are excited and optimistic about Mike Evans and the Buccaneers.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""lambchop"", ""post"": ""Mike, in that pic, looks like he let one rip and is hoping no one figures it out.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/run-game-explosion-brewing/|Run Game Explosion Brewing|Notice in the headline, Joe did not type “implosion.” It’s “explosion.” There’s a difference. “Explosion” means blow up. The other word means collapse from within. Just going by the numbers, if anything is going to implode Sunday night when the Bucs play the Cowboys deep in the heart of Texas, it will be the sorry Cowboys’ run defense. The Cowboys are the fourth-worst rush defense in the NFL, allowing an average of 136 yards a game. The Bucs? They’re tied with Green Bay for the fourth-best running attack through 14 games. The Bucs average 144.4 yards a game on the ground. Back in the summer, Joe thought if somehow the Bucs (who had the worst rushing offense in 2022 and 2023) could somehow elevate the run game to middle of the pack in the NFL, that would be a helluva improvement. But top-five? That just blows Joe away. And some people wonder why hiring Bucs offensive coordinator Liam Coen as a head coach might seem attractive to NFL owners.|2024-12-21 01:30:00|169|23|9|Bucs|Bucs' run game likely to excel against Cowboys' weak defense.|6|Positive comments about running game success, coaching staff, and keeping key personnel.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Boge"", ""post"": ""I\u2019m not generally a fan of running the ball but this new Bucs run game is pretty entertaining.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/todd-bowles-offers-love-for-logan-hall/|Todd Bowles Offers “Love” For Logan Hall|Joe guesses many fans do not share Bucs coach Todd Bowles’ enthusiasm for third-year defensive lineman Logan Hall. A high-second-round pick, Hall is more a rumor than an impact player. At least statistically. But Bowles raved about the Houston product yesterday after practice. “Logan has been playing very well,” Bowles said. “[I] love where he’s at playing the run. “He’s incorporated a pass rush to his arsenal as well. He’s helped us out a great deal this year.” Well, to be fair to Hall and Bowles, Hall is showing up (sort of) in the pass rush. He has 4.5 sacks, fourth-best on the Bucs. That sack total is also Hall’s best of his career since being drafted in 2022. Not exactly Reggie White numbers but Hall does have more sacks than any Bucs edge rusher (!). So there’s that. Hall doesn’t have many tackles (21 combined), but Joe believes that’s not a fair measurement of an inside defensive lineman. Unless a team runs right at an interior lineman, it’s very unusual for one to rack up a bunch of tackles like, say, a linebacker or a safety who has room to run and can cover more real estate. Selected with the first pick of the second round, Hall is someone Bucs fans want to see produce more, but it’s not like Hall is an empty body.|2024-12-21 00:00:00|226|25|6|Logan Hall|Todd Bowles praises Logan Hall's progress and contributions.|5|Mixed opinions on Logan Hall's performance, leaning slightly positive overall.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""GoneGator"", ""post"": ""He\u2019s been solid and that forced fumble against the Panthers saved our season."", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""21st,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""12:24"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Saskbucs"", ""post"": ""None of us should be mad about a 2nd round pick that might be the new Gholston out there for another 6-7 years.
