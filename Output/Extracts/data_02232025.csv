https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/new-baker-or-fluke-baker/|New Baker Or Fluke Baker?|A lot of Bucs fans are wondering if 2024 rookies Jalen McMillan and Bucky Irving can improve on their stunning stats next season. Joe is just as focused on another guy and one aspect of his game. That’s Baker Mayfield. Mayfield ran for 378 yards last season, more than double his previous career high. His escape skills and quality scrambling were key pieces of the Bucs’ offense. Mayfield also rushed for 24 first downs, another career high big a big margin. And guess who led the NFL in fumbles last season? Mayfield tied for the league lead with 13, a career high by a mile. So Joe’s wondering if Mayfield’s scrambling can and will continue at this high-octane, high-performance pace. And do the Bucs want Mayfield on the move? Rookie offensive coordinator Josh Grizzard told Joe and other reporters in an off-podium chat at One Buc Palace that Mayfield can improve by cutting turnovers. (He tied for the 2024 league lead in interceptions.) Maybe that means taking fewer chances and throwing balls away more often. If Mayfield goes back to his more typical 160 or so rushing yards per season, Joe would be just fine with that, though the Bucs will have to find ways to recapture the lost production.|2025-02-23 22:02:00|210|28|5|Baker Mayfield|Speculation on Mayfield's scrambling ability and turnovers for upcoming season.|5|Mixed sentiments on turnovers, impact on games, and Baker's performance, with some optimism.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Rod Munch"", ""post"": ""If you\u2019re throwing the ball a ton and putting up points, I don\u2019t care about turnovers that much.

The Bucs second-year center seems to think he has a ways to go, and he’s grateful his quarterback didn’t scream at him for his failures last season. Baker Mayfield was emphatic and supportive, Barton told SiriusXM NFL Radio last week. “Baker’s big thing with me coming in was he knew how much my head was spinning trying to learn the entire offense and learn the position and learn all that stuff at once,” Barton began. “And so, Baker, I can’t say enough about how awesome Baker was to me this year. I’m sure there were many a times where I deserved to get an ass-chewing from Baker. But, you know, he chose to just put confidence in me and help me learn and make sure we’re on the same page together. “He never brought be down. It was always about just giving me confidence. So Baker was really patient with me, and he had a lot of belief in me.” Lots of unity and love within the Bucs roster. It’s helped pull the team out of tough times the past two seasons. Hopefully, this year it helps keep them out of falling in those midseason ditches.|2025-02-23 20:08:00|205|14|7.5|Graham Barton|Baker supportive|6|Mixed sentiment with optimism for team development but some concerns about specific players and situations.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Aqualung"", ""post"": ""A definite strength of this team is the family team love and togetherness thing and for that Coach deserves credit.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/the-case-for-jihaad-campbell/|The Case For Jihaad Campbell|Joe does not listen to draft podcasts until April. You have no idea how mocked out Joe gets by the draft industrial complex and their endless mock drafts when it gets to about 10 days before the draft. So as a form of keeping semi-sanity, Joe tries to avoid draft talk — outside of the combine and when the draft is within sight. However, Joe has heard of a year-round draft podcast host that is not a fan of Bucs AC/DC-loving general manager Jason Licht. This host, Joe was told, doesn’t hate Licht and doesn’t think he is bad but the guy is irked by Licht because, allegedly, Licht doesn’t take chances. (Sorry, Joe’s not going to bring up kickers and punters this morning.) It’s rich that a guy with zero skin in the game wants an NFL general manager to take chances. What if Licht gambles and they blow up in his face? He loses his dream job and maybe his career. Meanwhile, the podcaster goes on his merry little small-paying way. An NFL suit once told Joe when it comes to the draft, “Safe is good.” The goal is to get a productive player who might be developed into a stud. Joe brings this up because Frank Schwab of Yahoo! thinks the Bucs should draft Jihaad Campbell of Alabama. Yes, the Bucs need an inside linebacker and Campbell looks like a very good one. But Schwab made a more direct point: picking a Nick Saban linebacker like Campbell is almost always a can’t-miss selection. Jihaad Campbell, LB, Alabama Why him? It’s hard to go wrong drafting talented players from Alabama, and Campbell would be a good fit for the defense. That’s especially true if Lavonte David isn’t back. Cornerback is also a strong option here. Well, if Lavonte David retires, the Bucs would be in a world of hurt at linebacker. If so, they better damn well draft Campbell and sign a free agent veteran with the money that otherwise would have gone to David. A Nick Saban linebacker is as close to plug-and-play as they come. So yeah, Campbell would be a safe pick, even though that may anger a podcaster in the draft industrial complex.|2025-02-23 11:00:00|369|35|5|Jihaad Campbell|Pros and cons of drafting Jihaad Campbell from Alabama.|5|Mixed sentiments with some optimism, skepticism, and frustration expressed by various commenters.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""ModHairKen"", ""post"": ""Devin White was can\u2019t miss too, now wasn\u2019t he?"", ""post_time"": [""February"", ""23rd,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""11:14"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Capt Kidd"", ""post"": ""White was can\u2019t miss his first couple of years and we wouldn\u2019t have the SB without him.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/better-bucky-irving-in-2025/|Better Bucky Irving In 2025?|NFL folks like to say the biggest jump in play a player makes is from his rookie season to his second season. If that holds true for Bucky Irving, could the Bucs be looking at an all-time great? The Bucs’ budding star running back’s numbers as a rookie were really staggering. His production had him right up there with some of the game’s greatest, including current running back studs, as pointed out by Brianna Dix of Buccaneers.com. Irving’s franchise record 5.4 yards per rush attempt average is the third-highest mark in NFL history among rookies with 200-plus rush attempts in a season, trailing only Adrian Peterson (5.6 in 2007) and Clinton Portis (5.5 in 2002). His 1,514 yards from scrimmage is the second-most by a rookie in team history, trailing only Doug Martin (1,926 in 2012). Irving gained an additional 609 yards after forcing missed tackles in 2024, second-most in the league behind only Derrick Henry (753) per Next Gen Stats. He averaged 5.5 yards per carry on rushes outside the tackles (fifth-most among running backs, minimum of 50 such carries) and 5.3 yards per carry on rushes inside the tackles (second-most among running backs) this season. Irving, Saquon Barkley, and Jahmyr Gibbs were the only running backs in the NFL to average over 5.0 yards per carry on rushes to each direction in 2024 (minimum of 50 rushes each direction). OK, so Bucky is up there with Adrian Peterson and Clinton Portis in rookie production. Peterson, we should all know about. Portis for a while there was a damn good running back. His problem was he was a running back, and like so many, they burn out after four or five years. Joe hopes new Bucs offensive coordinator Josh Grizzard uses Bucky in the very same way his predecessor Liam Coen did. Coen, smartly, ran a lot of counter-gaps for Bucky in which offensive lineman pulled to bulldoze an easier path. That what Bucky was used to at Oregon. The strategy worked beautifully. How Grizzard builds his offense and uses Bucky is a blank canvas. Joe will remind fans that the last awesome Bucs rookie running back, Doug Martin, who ran for a stunning 1,454 yards as a rookie in 2012, wasn’t the same player in his second season. LeGarrette Blount, a 1,000-yard rookie in 2010, also saw his play dip the following year.|2025-02-23 08:00:00|395|27|9|Bucky Irving|Can Bucky Irving become an all-time great in NFL?|5|Mixed sentiments with some optimism about Bucky's potential and some concerns about his workload.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Lt.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/bspn-bucs-better-off-without-rachaad-white/|BSPN: Bucs Better Off Without Rachaad White|Joe tries to think objectively, when it’s reasonable to think objectively. For example, Joe’s mind shuts down if anyone tries to insist NFL teams can win it all without the need of a quarterback or strong production from an edge rusher. Good luck with that. Joe has a lot of respect for Aaron Schatz, the inventor of DVOA and creator of Football Outsiders (RIP). He now is a force behind FTN Data and still contributes to BSPN. In his latest offering for the four-letter, Schatz thinks that since Rachaad White is a No. 2 back, his salary (and cap hit) can be put to much better use if the Bucs are hoping to build their roster for a Super Bowl run. Cut Rachaad White The Buccaneers enter free agency with only $2.2 million in cap space. They need to make some room and one way to do it is to say goodbye to White. The running back is entering the final year of his rookie contract, so the Buccaneers can cut him for $3.3 million in cap savings with less than $250,000 in dead money. White is still a useful player, but he gradually lost the No. 1 spot to Bucky Irving in 2024. White had positive rushing yards over expected, according to NFL Next Gen Stats, but he was far behind Irving. (White had 0.34 RYOE per carry, while Irving was at 0.94.) White was an excellent receiving back, ranking fifth in total receiving value by my DYAR metric, but Irving was eighth. The Buccaneers need to save money somewhere, and this is where it wouldn’t hurt too much. The more Joe thinks of this the more Joe is open-minded. If the Bucs would use White’s salary to bring in a stud edge rusher, this move has to be seriously considered. Think about it: Who would have more of an impact, an edge rusher who can consistently put heat on and make a quarterback eat dirt regularly, or White being a part-time player? For Joe, the answer is obvious. But Schatz is also correct that White is a very dangerous pass catcher. And he can pass block, which many fans overlook. That is a critical trait NFL folks rarely dismiss. With a new offensive coordinator coming in, the more weapons Josh Grizzard can have to smooth the transition the better. And White, in the passing game, is a weapon. But yeah, a solid full-time edge rusher or a part-time back? Joe knows which holds more weight. Getting rid of White only makes sense if there is a major upgrade for an impact player at a defensive starting position. Maybe the easiest solution is to rework White’s contract, but that likely would require a contract extension the Bucs aren’t interested in handing out.|2025-02-23 00:00:00|463|70|7|Rachaad White|Bucs consider cutting White to free up cap for upgrades.|5|Mixed opinions on cutting or trading Rachaad White, balancing offensive depth and defensive needs.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Derek"", ""post"": ""White wants to leave to be RB1 playing with Jayden Daniels."", ""post_time"": [""February"", ""23rd,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""12:06"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""BucVoyager"", ""post"": ""Let me be the first to say this is dumb.
