It might only be about pregame preparation.For others, yeah, they might make business decisions when it comes to tackling and hustling.This subject arose recently when Bucs Super Bowl-winning head coach Bucco Bruce Arians visited the Barstool Gambling show.Co-host Will Compton, the retired linebacker, referenced how he had been a part of bad teams and saw players spending far too much time focused on postseason vacation plans instead of football. Arians eagerly jumped in and said, “They’re checking out at Thanksgiving.”Joe saw evidence of this during The Lost Decade of Buccaneers football (2009-2018). Also, a former Bucs assistant coach once told Joe over a cold beverage that many assistant coaches are glued to media late in a bad season because they’re concerned about their current jobs — in addition to exploring potential opportunities with new teams.Joe’s takeaway was that coaches also get distracted when a team is circling the drain.On Sunday, the Bucs face a tanking Giants club in New Jersey before heading to play the depleted Panthers at Carolina (a team that just traded quality players for draft picks via trade).After that, the Raiders (2-8) make a December trip to Tampa from Vegas for a 1 o’clock kickoff.The Bucs (4-6) simply cannot lose those games against those teams.Bring canned foods to help local food banks and/or a toy for a local child.Bill Currie Ford, a mile north of the stadium on Dale Mabry Highway, is the place to watch the Bucs on Sunday.  The watch party runs from noon through the end of the game.

Because Cruz caught passes from Bucs offensive coordinator Liam Coen in college, and he stays tight with the Giants, the Bucs opponent on Sunday.Cruz didn’t talk about his old college buddy, unfortunately, or his former Giants teammate and current Bucs receiver Sterling Shepard.However, Cruz did talk about how miserable the Giants offense has been this season and for several years.In fact, through the past nine seasons, the Giants have averaged more than 20 points per game only twice. This year, New York is at 15 points per game.It’s a big reason they benched starting QB Daniel Jones for Sunday’s game and will roll with No. 3 QB Tommy DeVito.Per Cruz on SiriusXM NFL Radio, the Giants offense has no consistency and lacks athleticism and playmaking ability. Yes, he’s high on stud rookie receiver Malik Nabers, but Cruz says Nabers can’t be moved around and defenses are able double him up with enough success.Nabers had a special start to this season but he hasn’t busted 70 yards receiving or scored a TD in each of the past four games.The cynical side of Joe will say that probably means he’ll go for 115 yards and a touchdown against the Bucs, but the Giants have little else.Cruz says DeVito brings a lot of energy and will play loose with a nothing-to-lose attitude, and Cruz suspects the Giants will approach the game that way. Joe believes that could make the Giants dangerous.But how miserable are the Giants?Cruz suggested — during an intelligent conversation without the hint of a hot take — that the Giants should approach the 2025 NFL Draft and with a tanking mentality so they can be in line to pick QB Arch Manning at the top of the draft in 2026.The Bucs simply cannot lose to the Giants on Sunday.", "post_time": "2024-11-19T21:33:20+00:00", "word_count": 316, "number_of_comments": 18, "article_sentiment_score": "5", "article_subject": "Victor Cruz", "article_summary": "Giants offense struggles", "responses": {"commenter0": {"username": "Mort", "post": "If the giants beat the bucs, the season is over and we need to just pull a Lovie and start young guys every game the rest of the way.

Now the offense is up drastically be it Coen or him releasing the reins on it. He still has a pathetic defense which should be and has been a whole lot better. Is this all Bowles fault? Maybe not. As a coach for 20+ years I see there is conditioning problems. They show up in the 2nd and 4th quarters. The team can’t play more than 1 quarter without being exhausted to the point of mental and physical mistakes happen. This is because practices aren’t being run right. As a soccer coach you run your practices like game situations. So you play 2 quarters rest 15 min. Then run 2 more quarters. Just as you would in a game. If you run 1 game. rest run another quarter your body isn’t prepared for a whole hame. Mental mistakes has been proven to be caused by physical exhaustion. This could also explain all the muscle strains and tears as the body isn’t conditioned properly. Either the body is over worked and not enough rest or under worked and not used to a full game. So this could be a product of the head coach not planning practices properly or conditioning staff not preparing workout properly or a combination of both. Tweaking practices will help. But doing that prepare for either more injuries to start if you go the wrong direction until it is fixed.

Four consecutive losses have triggered a “Fire Bowles” frenzy and Buc Nation appears eager for a change at the top.And while Bowles has surely made his share of mistakes during this extended tailspin, there’s one question begging for an answer:Why is Jason Licht getting a pass?You’re not going to read another article in this market regarding Licht’s role in this franchise crisis. Unlike Bowles, his job is secure, even if the Bucs stumble to a 7-10 finish.That’s understandable because Licht has made more than a few outstanding picks in recent drafts. He also built a championship roster in 2020 — and the Glazers are forever grateful.But Licht’s strengths on the personnel side tend to mask some flaws that have contributed to the current malaise.While Bowles is trying everything in his power to manufacture a consistent pass rush, he doesn’t have the horses to lead a stampede.Licht has tried to draft dynamic edge rushers. Lord knows, he has tried. Noah Spence, Joe Tryon-Shoyinka, Logan Hall, YaYa Diaby and Chris Braswell were drafted to collapse the pocket.So far, the pocket is winning.Let’s remember that Shaq Barrett was signed as a free agent and Jason Pierre-Paul was acquired through trade. This offseason, Licht took a flyer on free agent Randy Gregory, who is now out of the league.Without facing the challenge of an edge rush, even an immobile quarterback like Kirk Cousins has carved the Bucs up twice. The lack of an edge rush has forced Bowles to commit additional resources in an effort to place passers under duress.Licht also has been a little loose with Glazer money.The Tristan Wirfs contract made him the highest paid offensive lineman in league history. The Antoine Winfield Jr. contract made him the highest paid defensive back in NFL history — the first time a safety earned that designation.Bowles has plenty to answer for. His game management has been uneven and his defense simply doesn’t tackle well. Only two teams have given up more yards after the catch and only nine teams have missed more tackles.Buc fans don’t want to hear the word “miscommunication” ever again, especially with almost two-thirds of the regular season in the books.But let’s not skip over the general manager when looking for culprits.Before the trade deadline, Licht failed to make a move to help this reeling defense. He essentially told the rest of the league “we’re good,” even though the Bucs are far from a a complete team.Has this coaching staff brought out the absolute best from this roster? Absolutely not, but there are holes that haven’t been filled and the addition of Mike Edwards certainly doesn’t qualify as a game-changer.Jamel Dean will be an upgrade on Josh Hayes when he returns, but Mr. Dean has now gone 32 consecutive regular-season games without an interception.Bowles never claimed to be the second coming of Bill Walsh or Bill Belichick. His conservative nature gets the best of him at times, but he has held this team together through some difficult times. The 2023 Bucs could have folded at 4-7. Instead, they won six of their next seven games and played very competitively on the playoff road, despite a talent gap against the Lions.That talent gap has widened this season, even though Tampa Bay somehow won at Detroit in Week 2.There’s a growing call for the Bucs to do everything possible to keep Liam Coen, so impressive as an offensive coordinator. Rookies Bucky Irving and Graham Barton have played key roles for an attack that averages 28 points.“Let’s dump Bowles and bump Coen up to head coach” is a popular refrain.When the Glazers elevated Dirk Koetter from OC to head coach in 2016, fans rejoiced. Three years and 29 losses later, it was apparent the Koetter experiment had failed.One day, Licht will justifiably enter the Buc Ring of Honor. Licht talked Bruce Arians out of the broadcast booth in 2019 and a year later, Tom Brady liked the roster enough to sign with Tampa Bay.But make no mistake … Licht has misjudged the talent on the defensive side of the ball and Bowles is paying a harsh price. K.J. Britt can’t cover and Buc edge rushers can’t put quarterbacks on their ass.Bowles has had an off week to figure out how to help an embattled secondary. The cavalry isn’t coming, so this outside pass rush has to improve from within.Good luck with that.For a coach who likes challenges, this one’s a whopper.Great time ahead Sunday!Watch the Bucs game free on Sunday with a Bucs great at Bill Currie Ford.

They knew edge rush was an issue and nothing from the past  performance from the players appeared to show anything would be better this year.  The answer was Randy Gregory?  Once the season started and the offense playing well, why was there no attempt to trade or sign someboby? So if that was Bowles and Licht well, there you go.  My only other coment to add. I cant help but wonder why they did not keep Davis and trade Dean. I mean Davis played better overall. Dean at his best and fully healthy, which is  seldom, cant buy an interception and consistently plays to soft. All of these are head scratchers to me.

He hopes all his experience can somehow help the Bucs rattle off a string of victories.“Hopefully I can bring a spark or whatever [the defense] may need, bring any type of help that I can bring to this team,” Edwards said yesterday from One Buc Palace. “I mean, not just defense, but the whole team and yeah, they had struggles but they also had some great parts of the season.”Edwards made a good point. He’s also a strong special teams guy. Who can forget how Edwards raced downfield on the kickoff team for the Bucs in Indianapolis to make a touchdown-saving tackle in the final moments of a 38-31 Bucs win that, had Edwards not made the tackle, would have turned a Bucs win into a heartbreaking loss?Edwards believes one play in four of the Bucs’ six losses was the difference. Edwards hopes he can provide that one missing play.“I’ve been keeping up with them from afar, watching some games, stuff like that,” he said. “Still a good team. The record might not show, but still a good team.”Despite being a part-time starter with the Bucs, Edwards has always been a ballhawk.

He doesn’t look remotely the same as he did this summer, forget about last year when he was named All-Pro.Winfield was sick during training camp the way he raced all over the field in scrimmages. He was perhaps faster than Joe had ever seen him. And Winfield played lights-out ball against the Commandos to open the season.It was very late in that game, a decisive Bucs win, that Winfield hurt his foot. He missed the next four games.(Missing four games with an injured foot sounds to Joe like a fracture or a severe sprain.)Even inside linebackers coach/defensive run game coordinator Larry Foote all but said Winfield may be having his worst season as a pro.“Winfield – he hasn’t missed a lot of tackles, and it seems like he’s missed a majority of his tackles in one season than he did through all of his career,” Foote said. “It’s tough. We’ve got to concentrate. More hats to the ball – it’s tough to bring guys down in this league.”So how does Foote help Winfield prevent missing so many tackles? Foote said the first step is to get to the ball — it’s hard to make a tackle if a defender isn’t in position to make a tackle.So hustle and good things will happen.“We’ve got to harp on the fundamentals – wrapping guys up, keep your head up,” Foote said. “The main thing to focus on is getting off of blocks. We need more hats to the ball.”Foote also said in regards to the pass defense that the Bucs have decided to go back to square one and focus on fundamentals. For Joe, that seems smart.Joe was starting to believe what Todd Bowles might want to do could be too complicated and maybe he needed to dial back his defense.Joe’s first order of business would be to let defensive tackles be defensive tackles and turn them loose on a quarterback on every passing down.

One.As Bucs head coach, Bowles is 0-2 in the game following a bye. His only win came in 2015, his first season leading the Jets.

Tom Brady was in the midst of marching the Bucs for a late game-winning drive in regulation. But Bowles pulled the rug out from under Brady citing the possibility Brady could throw a pick.Tom. Freaking. Brady! The nerve!!!To that point in the season (Game 11) Brady had a grand total of two interceptions.And all that came after Bowles took the ball out of Brady’s hands at the Cleveland 37-yard line on 4th-and-2 on a drive that could have put the game away.", "post_time": "2024-11-19T07:00:37+00:00", "word_count": 243, "number_of_comments": 50, "article_sentiment_score": "2", "article_subject": "Todd Bowles", "article_summary": "Poor post-bye performance streak for Todd Bowles as head coach.", "responses": {"commenter0": {"username": "Dave Pear", "post": "But, his Great Defender will step in to correct everyone as to why results are wrong and deflection, slight of hand and a lot of words are correct.", "post_time": "November 19th, 2024 at 2:18 am"}, "commenter1": {"username": "Bucswin?", "post": "The start of the questionable/costly decisions.

Watch what these guys can do when they’re actually coached to focus on rushing the passer and stopping the run rather than dropping into coverage. Logan Hall and JTS with a real DC and a proper scheme will play much better.

There’s a lot more to it than JUST Hall. With that said, I was screaming for him to trade UP for Linderbaum (when I saw that he was starting to fall), but the friggin’ RAVENS beat him to it!!!! I wanted Linderbaum with Wirfs together again, after seeing that ESPN piece on their HS Wresting Careers, etc. Unbelievable story.
