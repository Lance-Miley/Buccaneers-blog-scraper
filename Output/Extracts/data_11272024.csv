https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/11/yall-got-to-keep-sheps-head-clear/|“Y’all Got To Keep Shep’s Head Clear”|So who is the Bucs’ leader in dumb penalties this season? It’s the same guy who insiders at One Buc Palace often say leads the team in energy and intensity.  Veteran receiver Sterling Shepard has been a wild card this season. He’s done a good job taking handoffs and making big catches in limited time — 28 touches in 9 games. Coaches and players have praised him for being a constant energizer, uplifting teammates with boundless spirit and passion. Shepard was like that during his eight years with Giants, but this year, his first in Tampa, has come with four penalties, a huge number for his position. “Shep” has one each for unnecessary roughness, pass interference, unsportsmanlike conduct and illegal motion. Buccaneers running back Rachaad White joined SiriusXM NFL Radio this week and noted that players have been told to keep Shep’s mind right. “He plays furious and he plays ferocious, man,” White said of Shepard. “And you love a guy like that, and it gets to the point where coaches when we get to gameday be like, ‘Y’all got to keep Shep’s head clear. You all got to keep him calm’ and things like that. But no. That’s not how you play football. It’s a violent game. “It’s a crazy game. You got to be crazy to play this game. That’s just the reality of it, or have some craziness in you. So, Shep got all of that and he bring that juice, that energy, man. He’s still a great route runner. He’ll still catch that ball.” Joe enjoyed White saying that he wants no part of calming Shepard down. However, Joe thinks somebody should. Joe thought the bad penalites were behind Shepard, but he had a senseless illegal motion penalty against the Giants on Sunday that wiped out a Bucs gain. Regardless, Shepard has been a huge plus for the Bucs. And if he can stay healthy, an issue in his career, he could represent a quality postseason target for Baker Mayfield.

No, he’s not, but he’s certainly among the most unique, and among the most productive on a per-game basis. After another preseason calf issue cost Kancey the entire preseason and five regular season games, the Bucs’ second-year beast now has five sacks in six games. Perhaps more important, he’s flashed rare skill and racked up a bunch of other numbers. Todd Bowles says Kancey is one-of-a-kind on his defensive line. “He’s the only one up front that can get off a block and then explode from A to B right now,” Bowles told the Buccaneers Radio Network. “I mean, his closing speed on the quarterback is faster than what the quarterback thinks it is. And he can get there right now and it kind of surprises quarterbacks because he’s so quick getting back there. “He’s still tapping his potential. And he can see what he can do right now, and it’s a scary thought.” The sadsack Panthers, Sunday’s opponent, have played a few centers this season and made changes along their offensive line. The Carolina O-line may be the team’s strength, but that doesn’t raise it to the level of “good.” Joe sees the Bucs’ remaining schedule and thinks Kancey can challenge for double-digit sacks this season.|2024-11-27 15:45:00|220|28|8|Calijah Kancey|Unique and productive defensive tackle with high potential.|9|Optimistic outlook on players and team performance with some playful banter and sarcasm present.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Larrd"", ""post"": ""Kancey is definitely a 10 sack DT if he can ever play all the games.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/11/mike-evans-impact-on-offense-huge/|Mike Evans’ Impact On Offense “Huge”|If you thought the Bucs offense looked different Sunday against the Giants than in recent games, you are not alone. Joe thought the same. A big reason was future Hall of Fame receiver Mike Evans returned to the field, despite being/not being 100 percent, depending on who is talking. The offense just looked sharper, at least in the passing game. You could tell the Giants very much were paying attention to Evans. And that seemed to open up things for everyone. So today, Joe asked Bucs offensive Liam Coen what sort of impact Evans’ return brought after missing three games with a bum hamstring, suffered in the loss to Baltimore. “Huge, huge!” Coen said. “Just his presence alone, what it does, what you can at times dictate in terms of what kind of defensive structure you’re going to get.” It wasn’t just the X’s and O’s element where Evans made an impact, Coen said. Evans’ confidence, he said, is contagious. “The players draw confidence” [from Evans], Coen added. An area of the field Coen had planned to attack against the Giants just so happens to be an area where Evans shines. “His ability to go win one-on-one routes and give us some plays down the field — more so in that intermediate range where we were trying to get into this past week,” Coen said. Evans is “such a good dude. It’s always good to have him back.” The way the offense was so sharp with Evans back gave Joe hope that running the table in the final six weeks isn’t as crazy as Joe previously believed. Evans is good enough to carry an offense — so long as he has a healthy hamstring.|2024-11-27 13:42:00|284|16|9|Mike Evans|Mike Evans' return greatly impacts Bucs' offense for the better.|3|Mixed sentiments with some optimism but doubts about players carrying the team.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""DavidBigBucsFan99"", ""post"": ""Yet we had him and Godwin and did nada against the Broncos.

Opinions vary across Bucs fandom. Iconic Bucs linebacker Lavonte David is confident the Bucs will make a run. Yesterday, Kay Adams of Up & Adams asked David why he’s so sure. “We’re a resilient team,” David said. “You know, we know how to handle the ups and the downs. We got a different attitude. Play very hard. Effort is incredible for everybody, and everybody just loves to play football. That’s what I really like. Everbody’s searching for the same goal. Everybody wants to do the same thing. Everybody wants to win.” David went on to praise the coaches and player-driven leadership, which he said will get the team past tough times. In his own leadership move, David said he invited the entire team to join him for a showing Gladiator II very recently. Attendance was good. Fun was had, and he said that included some coaches. David picked up the bill, including snacks, and said that kind of team bonding can make a difference.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/11/liam-coen-says-he-is-not-coaching-baker-mayfield-to-block-40-yards-downfield/|Liam Coen Says He Is Not Coaching Baker Mayfield  To Block 40 Yards Downfield|Joe doesn’t think there is a football fan alive who didn’t think it was cool to see Baker Mayfield being the lead blocker for Bucky Irving Sunday at midfield. But just like watching a running back or receiver try to hurdle a defender, it may look cool, but it also may not be smart. And that is the fine line Bucs offensive coordinator Liam Coen walks. He loves Mayfield’s heart and hustle. He loves how Mayfield is trying to be a team guy. But Coen also confessed he and the Bucs need Mayfield for the playoff push and not to get lit up by a linebacker. This morning at One Buc Palace, Coen was asked if he coaches Mayfield to race downfield to block. Coen smiled broadly as he enjoyed the play too. You can tell by the way he answered that he’s not overly fond of Mayfield trying to be a lead blocker. But, Coen said, Mayfield’s downfield blocking is a form of what Coen preaches to his players: Be a team guy and give full effort. “No, no practice,” Coen said denying the Bucs actually work on Mayfield’s downfield blocking. “Our thought process as a unit is to play for each other. “That’s all we talk about. What you put on tape, your teammates are going to see. Everybody is going to see. “So if you put kind of crummy effort on tape and you get an oppotunity to get a block on somebody for your buddy and you don’t do it, well, they might look at you a little funky.” Coen said Mayfield racing downfield to be a lead blocker is just in Mayfield’s DNA. “I do think it is a product of him and how he is wired and the person he is,” Coen said. “But [Mayfield] is to exemplify how we want to play the game on offense.” Again, it looks cool. And Joe is fully convinced effort like that from a quarterback stokes teammates, not just on offense but the defense, too. Last year in the season-opening win at Minnesota, Mayfield ran for a key first down where he bullied his way through a tackle to get it. You could see the defense in the background erupt in delight that their quarterback was selling out to help them secure a win. That type of play is contagious, but also dangerous. The Bucs don’t need to try to make the playoffs with a quarterback who has thrown but 10 passes in his three-year career.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/11/no-tendencies-good-red-zone-offense/|No “Tendencies” = Good Red Zone Offense|Guess who has the best red zone offense in the NFC when it comes to scoring touchdowns? That’s right, it’s the Falcons the Buccaneers.  Tampa Bay converts red zone visits into touchdowns at a 69.77 percent rate, a notch better than Detroit. In a fun moment today at One Buc Palace, Tampa Bay offensive coordinator Liam Coen said he has no idea what the Bucs’ stats are in the red zone. But Coen did say it’s crucial for a red zone offense to keep defenses guessing. “Stay out of the predictiblity of the game,” he lectured. Coen noted that means personnel, plays, formations — everything. Before Sunday’s blowout win against the Giants, the Bucs ranked third in the NFL in points per red zone visit. Joe doesn’t have the new data, but the Bucs certainly remain in that elite range. Hopefully, Coen can stay creative in the money zone but not get too cute, like calling on Sean Tucker when better options are available.

So we just got to be smart with him, though.” Interesting take from Coen considering Licht said before Sunday’s game that Evans is “100 percent.” Yesterday on the Buccaneers Radio Network, Bowles was asked if Evans was on any kind of pitch count or restrictions. “No. We let him go. It was a green light,” Bowles said. “And he felt good afterwards.” Bowles added that Evans looked good, handled double teams and helped open up the offense. So which is it? Does Evans have a “green light” or are the Bucs following a “yellow light,” as Coen implied when he talked about avoiding putting Evans in “danger” and being smart with him. Yeah, Joe’s obsessed. That Evans hamstring is the key to the Bucs accomplishing anything meaningful in the postseason, and possibly essential to them reaching the postseason.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/11/mike-evans-catches-footballs-and-draws-flags/|Mike Evans Draws Flags At Historic Rate|Throw the ball to Mike Evans and the future Hall of Fame receiver can move the ball, not just in the conventional way. You know how the Sage of Tampa Bay sports, Ira Kaufman, often says on his podcast that referees are so flag-happy with defensive pass interference calls that just throwing the ball in the vicinity of Evans means there’s a good chance he will pick up a first down even if he doesn’t catch the ball. That’s because Evans, Ira says, has a knack for luring defensive backs into interference penalties. Boy, Ira wasn’t joking. Over at FTN Data, a stats site that focuses on fantasy sports (and is the internet home to the Father of FVOA, Aaron Schatz), they revealed a stat that surprised Joe. When Giants corner Adoree’ Jackson got flagged for interfering with Evans late in the third quarter on Sunday, giving the Bucs a 22-yard gain and a first down, that play put Evans over the top as being the NFL career leader in drawing DPI yards. (DPI stats have only been charted since 1979) Evans has totaled 834 career yards in DPI flags. He was tied with Randy Moss at 812. It’s awesome that a lot of defensive backs figure the only way they can slow Evans down is to get handsy with him. In a weird if not twisted way, that’s respect.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/11/conor-orr-doubts-todd-bowles-is-on-solid-ground/|Conor Orr Doubts Todd Bowles Is On Solid Ground|This is interesting to Joe, and Joe will explain. First, the core of the story. SI NFL columnist Conor Orr was a guest along with James Palmer on the “Heed the Call” podcast hosted by NFL.com expatriates Dan Hanzus and Marc Sessler. Palmer, too, is an NFL Media refugee. There, the quartet decided to take a look at the job security of all 32 NFL coaches. Each had different takes and views on coaches thought to be safe or on a roasting hot seat. When it came to the perceived status of Bucs coach Todd Bowles, it grew very interesting for Joe. Bowles’ name was included in the category of “Likely Bullet Proof.” Hanzus rattled off the names in this group only stopping when someone wanted to interject a comment. When Hanzus read off “Bowles,” Orr raised his hand to offer pushback. “I think I’d kick him down one [level],” Orr said. “I think we have to have a good back-end to the season here.” Palmer asked Orr, “Can you see a good back-end to the season? Because I can.” Orr agreed. “I can,” Orr said. “That’s the thing. The schedule is excellent. Everything is breaking. I do think they will win that division. “But, I think it is unignorable that this idea of, maybe over the last two seasons, you keep hearing this chatter, ‘OK, maybe they may want to go in a different direction.’ But they keep winning and hanging on.” Hanzus also sided with Orr. “I’m with you,” Hanzus said. So Bowles was bumped to a lower group “We Need To Show Progress.” Why does this interest Joe? Let’s connect a few dots, shall we? Joe attends NFL media events like the combine and Super Bowl Opening Night/media week. Orr also is there talking to NFL shot-callers, coaches, general managers, agents and, yes, sometimes owners over drinks in bars or burgers at places like Steak n’ Shake in downtown Indianapolis. Jerry Jones, for example, is more than happy to have a bourbon and talk turkey with reporters. Off the record, of course. Joe once saw Packers president Mark Murphy at Steak n’ Shake taking care of his late-night munchies grabbing grub near midnight, just like any other schlub. Very approachable. So, this is to say Joe knows Orr talks to a lot of NFL people. So the reference to “chatter” perked up Joe’s ears. Now, just this past weekend, Diana Russini, who Joe knows is very well-plugged in with NFL heavy hitters, posted a story for The Athletic claiming her intel from NFL coaches and suits says Bill Belichick’s name comes up “frequently” linking him to the Bucs. And yes, Joe fully understands Bowles is still employed. But with this “chatter,” now from two sources in recent days who know their way around the NFL media playground, if Bowles can’t lead the Bucs to the playoffs with what so many perceive as a cotton-candy-soft schedule over the next six weeks, Bowles could be coaching for his gig.|2024-11-27 07:00:00|500|63|5|Todd Bowles|Doubts raised about job security due to upcoming schedule challenges.|4|Mixed sentiments regarding Coach Bowles, some positive, some critical, uncertainty about his future.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Lt.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/11/creative-offense-from-liam-coen/|Creative Offense From Liam Coen|Byron Leftwich could never! Really creative, fun stuff here from Bucs offensive coordinator Liam Coen. So let’s think about it: If it is smart to get the ball into the hands of your best players (it is), who are they on the Bucs offense? Well, Mike Evans obviously. Bucky Irving, sure. Cade Otton? Don’t forget about him. And yeah, Rachaad White is a serious weapon in the passing game. So why not get all four of them on the field at once? That’s what Coen is trying to do. Evan Closky of WTSP-TV Channel 10 broke down tape of the Bucs’ win Sunday in the New Jersey Swamplands. He shows ways Coen uses those four weapons at the same time. Coen likes to call Irving and White in the backfield at the same time “Pony.” Often, Coen had Irving line up at receiver, which should really throw off a defense. Will Irving run a jet sweep? Will Irving go out on pass routes? Would the Bucs fake a run up the middle with White and pitch to Irving coming off the edge? Lots of fun possibilities from these formations. And this is just one of a few reasons why “this Joe” is pretty confident Coen will be a head coach somewhere in the lower-48 next season.  |2024-11-27 03:45:00|216|13|7.5|Liam Coen|Creative offensive strategies showcased with Bucs' key players.|5|Varied sentiments, leaning towards optimism but with concerns and uncertainties about the future.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Joe in Michigan"", ""post"": ""Hopefully Coen will be ready to be the Head Coach of the Bucs next year."", ""post_time"": [""November"", ""27th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""5:47"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Buccaneric"", ""post"": ""I don\u2019t want this offense somewhere else next year\u2026."", ""post_time"": [""November"", ""27th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""6:22"", ""am""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""Hodad"", ""post"": ""Coen isn\u2019t going anywhere."", ""post_time"": [""November"", ""27th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""6:32"", ""am""]}, ""commenter3"": {""username"": ""PSL Bob"", ""post"": ""Very cool breakdown.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/11/chucky-says-baker-mayfield-is-a-gruden-grinder/|Chucky Says Baker Mayfield Is A “Gruden Grinder”|Chucky is back to being a media machine like his old days working for the four-letter. Although now, Chucky is working for Barstool Sports. Dave Portnoy, El Presidente of Barstool Sports, hired Chucky recently and claims advertisers are beating down his door to work with Chucky. So much for the NFL’s rationale for blackballing Chucky. (Allegedly.) Among the projects Portnoy has Chucky working on is a weekly “Gruden’s Grinders” that has Chucky highlighting the strong play from guys who like to do the grimy, sweating, tough work in the NFL. Chucky gave Baker Mayfield a shoutout this week for his play against the Giants. Chucky loves how Mayfield hurt a defense in so many ways: legs, arm, or blocking 40-50 yards downfield. “We have the heart and soul of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Baker Mayfield,” Chucky began. “He jumps over bodies for a touchdown, then he’s downfield as a lead blocker. “Eleven different receivers. And I love this thing he does.” Chucky then began imitating Mayfield imitating Tommy Cutlets. “I’m working on it,” Chucky smiled of his imitation. “Way to go Mayfield.” The way Mayfield played Sunday, he was like a 12th man. What defense expects a quarterback to block downfield like 40 yards? Defenses have to worry about Mayfield’s arm, his legs and now his blocking. That’s a guy willing to put the offense on his back and carry his team to the playoffs if he has to.  |2024-11-27 00:00:00|239|14|10|Baker Mayfield|Chucky praises Mayfield's versatile and gritty play.|3|Mixed sentiments, with some praise and support for Baker Mayfield and some sarcastic comments.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""ModHairKen"", ""post"": ""The NFL and Goodell bullied that bowl cut simpleton in Vegas.
