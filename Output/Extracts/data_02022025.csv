https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/liam-coen-cites-bucs-brutal-losses-and-coaching-shift/|Liam Coen Cites Bucs’ “Brutal” Losses And Coaching Shift|Yeah, Bucs fans are sick of hearing from Liam “El Serpiente” Coen, the 2024 Tampa Bay offensive coordinator who slithered into the Jacksonville head coaching job and left Bucs officials outraged. However, Coen has a ton of unshared Bucs insight, so Joe will continue monitoring all things Coen. Joe even just caught up on an intriguing Dave Canales interview about clock management. Jaguars reporter John Shipley of SI.com penned an interesting piece today on Coen talking about coaching emphasis in Tampa and how playing in a lot of tight games tests a team and its players. Coen talked about how winning close games can be luck, skills, coaching, playmaking or just a team that collectively knows how to rise up. It seems the Bucs’ painful two games against the Falcons left scars and prompted change. “Like we had some really brutal losses in in Tampa this past year. We lose on Thursday night to Atlanta in a four-minute drill where our rookie running back, who was a stud for us this year, fumbles the ball,” Coen said, referring to Bucky Irving at running back. “In a moment that, man, like that’s such a learning moment. And then we kept — we had a couple more hard ones that we we didn’t get right.   As Coen would note, that is when things began to shift for Tampa Bay — and it took a concentrated effort to understand how and why the close losses were happening for the Buccaneers to flip the narrative.   “But then we go on the bye. We make like a real effort to truly practice and teach so much situational football throughout the week that, hey, at least we know we could win, we could lose, but our preparation was right, and the teaching of to Bucky in that moment,” Coen said. The emphasis there from Coen about how Todd Bowles and his staff used the bye to go over-the-top on situational football is interesting. Did the Bucs think they were deficient prior to that? Hopefully, Bowles and the remaining 2024 Bucs staff learned a few lessons this season that can help in the fall of 2025.|2025-02-02 11:11:00|359|61|7|Liam Coen|Coen reflects on Bucs' losses|5|Mixed sentiments towards Coen and Bowles, varying from criticism to support and indifference.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Jmarkbuc"", ""post"": ""Really should be teaching situational football from camp on.."", ""post_time"": [""February"", ""2nd,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""11:16"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""dbbuc711"", ""post"": ""Thinking Coen and Shad may have a short honeymoon of they start with losses and Bucs start with wins.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/creed-humphrey-calls-tristan-wirfs-freak-of-all-freaks/|Creed Humphrey Calls Tristan Wirfs “Freak Of All Freaks”|So Chiefs All-Pro center and three-time Pro Bowler Creed Humphrey was asked to name his four best offensive linemen in the NFL. There was no call to choose tackles or guard or centers; Creed simply picked his four best linemen at any position. At No. 4 on his chart, after Eagles right tackle Lane Johnson, Chiefs guard Joe Thuney (who’s been playing some tackle this season) and Lions right tackle Penei Sewell, Humphrey turned his attention to the Bucs’ left tackle, Tristan Wirfs. After being named an All-Pro last month, Wirfs is now the first player in NFL history to be a first-team All-Pro at right tackle and at left tackle. “A freak athlete, freak of all freaks, man,” Humphrey said of Wirfs on CBS Sports HQ. “You know, switching from right side to left side — not missing a beat doing that, playing at an All-Pro level, he’s just a stud in the pass game and run game, as well.” Joe loves to hear the Wirfs accolades from players with no known bias. He is a freak. Also, Joe is always intrigued by Humphries. He was selected one pick before Kyle Trask in Round 2 of the 2021 NFL Draft. Bucs history may have drastically changed if it were Tampa Bay that found Humphrey in their lap.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/i-cant-be-mad-at-that/|“I Can’t Be Mad At That”|Bucs fans are still furious. And Joe doesn’t blame them one bit. Having typed that, Joe doesn’t know what former Bucs offensive coordinator and new Jags head coach Liam Coen was supposed to do. Shad Con Khan allegedly waved $60 million (and some power to pick his general manager) in his face to keep his yap shut for 24 hours. Despite the ethical minefield that order from Con Khan put Coen in, $60 million is $60 million. That can buy a lot of Plant City strawberries. That’s generations-changing money. If Coen can cobble together a couple of winning seasons in Jacksonville, he may double that $60 million contract in the next decade with Con Khan. The guy who very easily could be damaged most by Coen leaving, Baker Mayfield, seems to see it the same way. Mayfield really wanted Coen back with the Bucs. But he told Joe’s good friend and local sports media icon Rock Riley yesterday at Pro Bowl practices that can’t blame Coen for taking the money and running to northeast Floria. “I know people are going to be upset by it,” Mayfield admitted in Orlando. “For him, Ashley and their kids, you can’t argue with that decision. “I can’t be mad at that. As much as I would want to have him still here … life goes on and I’m happy for him.” Mayfield might be the guy with the most to lose without Coen around. It was Coen who helped save Mayfield in Los Angeles from the NFL scrap heap when the rest of the league gave up on him. Coen helped rescue Mayfield’s career. Then Mayfield came to the Bucs on a prove-it deal and 2023 Bucs offensive coordinator Dave Canales helped guide him to a career year — before Coen turned the Oklahoma product into one of the top quarterbacks in the league this season. If recent history holds, Joe wonders where new Bucs offensive coordinator Josh Grizzard will be head coach this time next year.  |2025-02-02 08:30:00|333|40|7|Baker Mayfield|Mayfield is understanding and supportive despite coaching changes.|4|Mixed reactions to Coen's departure, with focus on the handling rather than the decision.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Scotty in Fat Antonio"", ""post"": ""Correct me if I am wrong.

One event at the watered down and nearly worthless Pro Bowl celebration in Orlando was dodgeball, where Bucs Pro Bowl QB Baker Mayfield worked as an ESPN announcer. Among the nuggets Mayfield dropped was noting how hard it has been for him to do anything too athletic the past few days because he’s in the middle of his postseason rest time. Apparently, Mayfield will ramp back up his training soon. He’s already been spotted in Tampa at bars and been on a tropical vacation. Hey, earned it. Joe also was intrigued to hear Mayfield talk about his high school baseball career. Mayfield said he played nearly every position but pitcher because he was too wild. He could throw hard, Mayfield said, but “I couldn’t throw a strike.” That same guy who couldn’t get a ball over the plate just had a 71.4 percent completion rate this season in the National Football League.|2025-02-02 08:14:00|174|21|5|Baker Mayfield|Mayfield's athletic history revealed; mixed sentiment.|7|Positive sentiment overall with strong support for Baker as Bucs QB and potential MVP.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Marky mark"", ""post"": ""Footballs don\u2019t go 100"", ""post_time"": [""February"", ""2nd,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""9:04"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Bucs Guy"", ""post"": ""Enjoy your downtime Baker.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/jamel-dean/|Jamel Dean And His Big Salary|When a guy is entering his seventh season in the league and has yet to play a full season, that’s a red flag for Joe. And that is why Joe has run out of rope with Jamel Dean. Look, the guy isn’t a bad corner, and Dean is a stand-up guy. Never ducks when things are bad and Joe has seen Dean on his off days at One Buc Palace working out more than Joe’s seen any other player. So that right there shows Dean has his heart and mind in the right place. But dang it, he cannot stay healthy. Some guys are just injury-prone. Dean is that guy. Joe has only seen one NFL player who wanted to get hurt and that was Myron Lewis. He wanted a check more than he wanted to play (or practice). Dean ain’t no Myron Lewis. Over at BSPN, follicly-challenged Billy Barnwell thinks Dean better be watching his back this spring and, of all the Bucs with bloated contracts, he’s the most vulnerable to getting released. Potential candidates for release: CB Jamel Dean. The Bucs have six players with cap holds over $5 million on their 2025 roster. The only one in danger of being released is Dean, though that’s more a product of injuries than subpar play. He has yet to play a full season as a pro, and he has missed nine full games and significant portions of five more over the past two years because of injuries. He is a solid corner in a defense with a blitz rate that puts its corners in difficult situations on a regular basis, which will play in his favor, but the 28-year-old’s $13 million compensation is unguaranteed. The Bucs might try to play hardball and ask him to take a pay cut to return. That’s what Joe believes will happen. Joe has heard Dean has at least one supporter with influence at One Buc Palace. Per Spotrac.com, the Bucs’ would take a cap hit of less than $7 million if Dean is released this offseason. As often as Dean is hurt, guys pushing or past the age of 30 don’t bounce back from injuries as quickly as they did when they were just past legal drinking age. Dean turns 29 in October. He missed five games last year, the most of his career. In three of the Bucs’ last four playoff games, only once (last year against Philadelphia) was Dean able to finish a playoff game. In the playoff loss to Dallas after the 2022 season, Dean hurt but active and benched for Sean Murphy-Bunting. If a guy can’t stay on the field for a team’s most important games, then what’s the point? If the Bucs keep Dean, they better get a capable, reliable corner to play for him when he’s hurt. But why spend the money on two corners when you can spend less Team Glazer loot on one who has a better chance of snapping on a chin strap in January games?|2025-02-02 08:00:00|502|47|2|Jamel Dean|Concerns about injuries and potential release due to performance.|3|Comments overall express frustration with Dean's injuries and performance, advocating for his release or replacement.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Truth be Told"", ""post"": ""Buh bye.

Devin White was one of those guys. You never knew what he meant from any of his social media posts. Well, Mike Evans ain’t that kind of guy. Evans, the future Hall of Fame receiver, said over a week ago he posted a Bible verse on Instagram. Evans said many of his followers thought Evans was trying a sly way to tell people then-Bucs offensive coordinator Liam Coen was gone, or that Evans would find divine guidance to help him survive unscathed through another offensive coordinator change. “I don’t do that,” Evans told Joe’s good friend, local sports media icon Rock Riley from the Pro Bowl practices in Orlando yesterday. However, Evans did say someone left a comment on his Instagram post saying Coen in fact left the Bucs. So it was a fan that tipped off Evans that Coen was gone. No one from the Bucs. Not Coen, either.
