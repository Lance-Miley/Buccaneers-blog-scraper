Fitzpatrick spent the 2019 and 2020 seasons with the Dolphins under during their Brian Flores. Grizzard was on the Miami staff as an assistant, dating back to his sentence there during the Adam Gase regime. Fitzpatrick liked what he saw from the young coach, who led Dolphins receivers in 2020. A Harvard man, Fitzpatrick forgave Grizzard for attending Yale, the Alma mater of Dolphins head coach Mike McDaniel, who kept Grizzard on staff after Flores was fired. “I was with Grizz in Miami for two years and knew he would get this chance at some point in the near future, ” Fitzpatrick shared on X today. “… Despite his questionable decision making when selecting a college, I am really happy and excited for him and the Bucs.” The Fitzpatrick endorsement doesn’t mean much, but it does mean he might have unique insight when the Bucs play games broadcast on Amazon, where Fitz is a Thursday Night Football analyst.|2025-01-31 18:12:00|174|19|7|Josh Grizzard|Fitzpatrick approves of new Bucs coordinator.|3|Mixed sentiment with some positive and negative comments about various topics.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""DungyDance"", ""post"": ""Joe, you should always use Fitz\u2019s picture from when he wore DeSean Jackson\u2019s outfit during that post game presser.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/todd-bowles-nobody-beats-the-grizz-buccaneers-josh-grizzard/|Todd Bowles: Nobody Beats The “Grizz”|Nobody beat the Grizz! That was the word today from head coach Todd Bowles after Tampa Bay hired Josh Grizzard to be its new offensive cooridinator — their fourth in four seasons. The Bucs emailed a quote from the head coach about his 34-year-old playcaller who has never called plays at a high level. Josh Grizzard commanded his head coach’s respect. “Josh is bright and innovative and was instrumental in our game planning and play design over the last year,” Bowles said.“After interviewing several outstanding candidates throughout this process, it ultimately became clear that our best option was here in our building. We had a lot of success offensively last season and during our conversations, Grizz provided some great ideas on how we can build on that. His familiarity with our offense, our players and the staff will ensure the continuity that is crucial for sustained success.” Not mentioned is that franchise quarterback Baker Mayfield likes the guy and blessed the hire. Bowles did well firing Bucco Bruce Arians’ offensive coordinator Byron Leftwich after the 2022 season and then hiring Dave Canales (now the Panthers head coach) to replace him. Last year’s replacement was Liam Coen, the new Jaguars head coach who had the Bucs averaging 29.5 points per game. The bar is ridiculously high for Grizzard. If he can’t meet it, then Bowles’ defense will need to improve significantly for the Bucs to have a shot at playoff run.|2025-01-31 17:41:00|240|28|5|Todd Bowles|Tampa Bay hires new offensive coordinator.|6|Mixed sentiment with optimism about the new OC but concerns about the defense and run game.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""ModHairKen"", ""post"": ""He will be better than DUUUUUVVVVAALLLLL"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""31st,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""5:45"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Pewter Power"", ""post"": ""he\u2019s a heady guy"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""31st,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""5:57"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""David"", ""post"": ""The offense can be better than last year with health and another receiver.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/did-the-bucs-protect-themselves-in-the-josh-grizzard-contract/|Did The Bucs Protect Themselves In The Josh Grizzard Contract?|Tampa Bay lost its 2023 and 2024 offensive coordinators to head coaching gigs: Dave Canales and Liam “El Serpiente” Coen. Today, the Bucs hired another new offensive coordinator. Did they approach his contract with a status-quo mindset? It’s easy to point fingers of blame for Coen leaving the building last week. They can go in many directions, but Joe is certain that everyone at One Buc Palace in mid-December wanted Coen back on the team next season. For unknown reasons, Bucs managment didn’t pounce on Coen like a rabid dog before Christmas with a giant check to cash, one tied to Coen not interviewing for a 2025 head coaching gig. “Honey, they’re offering us $5.1 million to not do a Zoom call that I haven’t been offered yet.” The Bucs attacked re-signing Coen, it appears, like the Bucs played defense against the Falcons this season. They tried but, you know. It’s a water snake under the bridge now, and perhaps it will turn out to be a fantastic end result for the franchise. Joe doesn’t rule Coen’s departure having a happy ending. However, Joe sure hopes the Bucs got creative structuring the contract of new playcaller Josh Grizzard, today’s 34-year-old, in-house hire. Joe would give a series of “for examples,” but Joe knows Team Glazer and their subordinates are far smarter than Joe in this realm.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/baker-mayfield-got-his-man/|Baker Mayfield Got His Man|Joe assumes/hopes/prays that the Bucs put their new offensive coordinator hire largely in the hands of their 29-year-old franchise quarterback. As Joe wrote weeks ago, it’s the only thing that makes sense. Not only has Baker Mayfield played for a tremendous number of coordinators and assistant coaches in his seven seasons spanning four teams, the Bucs are a win-now kind of team and Mayfield needs to have massive confidence in the guy he’ll go to football war with daily. Joe suspects Mayfield and his offensive mates were yearning for continuity, as well, without tossing their playbook in the Hillsborough River for the third consecutive season. Presumably, new coordinator Josh Grizzard, 34, the in-house hire, will work with Mayfield to craft a relatively seamless transition. Todd Bowles has a good track record of hiring playcallers and spent the past year around Grizzard. That gives Joe a load of confidence on this sunny Friday.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/bucs-have-a-new-offensive-coordinator/|Bucs Have A New Offensive Coordinator|It appears the Bucs have found their man. How long he sticks around is another question. Josh Grizzard, the 2024 Bucs passing game coordinator, was promoted today to offensive coordinator, per Tom Pelissero of NFL Network. Yes, Grizzard is an in-house hire. The good: Grizzard knows Liam Coen’s offense and worked with Baker Mayfield. Allegedly, per Coen, he was key in crafting third downs plays, whatever that means. Grizzard, 34, also worked with Mike McDaniel in Miami, who comes from the Kyle Shanahan tree. The bad: Grizzard has never called plays in the NFL or college. Grizzard was an offensive assistant for offensive Dolphins head coaches Adam Gase and Brian Flores. Joe is hoping for the best.|2025-01-31 15:28:00|117|74|4|Josh Grizzard|Bucs promote in-house hire to offensive coordinator.|3|Mixed response with concerns about lack of experience but optimism for continuity and potential success.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""darengibo"", ""post"": ""Love it!

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/liam-coen-baker-mayfield-and-nick-caley/|Liam Coen, Baker Mayfield And Nick Caley|Quite an education was delivered this morning from a QB who has played in various systems and has studied departed Bucs offensive coordinator Liam Coen. Brian Hoyer played for 9 teams in 15 NFL seasons, his last stop being in Las Vegas and his first stop backing up Tom Brady as a rookie in 2009. Nowadays, Hoyer is a co-host on SiriusXM NFL Radio and quickly has gotten a reputation as a guy very comfortable talking Xs and Os and offensive schemes and evolution. Joe loves it, but Joe suspects many fans aren’t interested. Regardless, Hoyer talked today about the Bucs’ search for a new offensive coordinator. That led to Hoyer sharing that he watched Coen at a coaching clinic and was surprised that the construction of his call sheet — and his explanation of how he builds it — was identical to the Patriots’ system. Hoyer explained the Patriots call sheet is very different from the Sean McVay-style sheet, but that insight told Hoyer that Coen was more of a hybrid coordinator and not a McVay clone. The Bucs interviewed Marcus Brady (Chargers) and Nick Caley (Rams) to replace Coen, and Hoyer noted he worked with both of them and they could be more in the Coen mold than others. Interesting to Joe was Hoyer talking about how Baker Mayfield will/should drive the playbook construction with the new coordinator, and Hoyer sort of said what Sage Ira Kaufman has been saying on his podcast: that the Bucs almost have too much talent on the offense to screw it up.|2025-01-31 14:43:00|260|17|5|Liam Coen|QB education and coordinator search insights.|6|Mixed sentiments on offense and coaching changes, with both optimism and pessimism expressed.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Tye"", ""post"": ""\u201cthe Bucs almost have too much talent on the offense to screw it up.\u201d"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""31st,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""2:49"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""HC Grover"", ""post"": ""If we have too much talent to screw it up the I wonder\u2026how did we screw it up?"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""31st,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""2:54"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""Pewter Pirate"", ""post"": ""Nick Caley just turned down the Jets."", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""31st,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""2:54"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter3"": {""username"": ""GoneGator"", ""post"": ""@Tye Please explain how our head coach is notorious for screwing up our offense."", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""31st,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""2:55"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter4"": {""username"": ""Oxycondomns"", ""post"": ""bowles will claim hes 3 for 3 on offensive coordinators"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""31st,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""2:56"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter5"": {""username"": ""Trey Alderson-Cloutier"", ""post"": ""Joe do you have the link to the Hoyer podcast?

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/bucs-block-another-coach-from-interviewing-with-liam-coen-jags/|Bucs Block Another Coach From Interviewing With Liam Coen, Jags|Someone at One Buc Palace is still sore. Earlier this week it was reported that former Bucs offensive coordinator and current coach of the Jags, Liam Coen, made an attempt to lift Bucs offensive line coach Kevin Carberry. Since Carberry is under contract with the Bucs, Jacksonville first had to get permission from Tampa Bay to interview him. The Bucs put a Tristan Wirfs-like block on Coen. Since, per Adam Schefter of BSPN, Coen once again tried to hit on the Bucs. The Jags asked for permission to interview assistant offensive line coach Brian Picucci, who served as a quality control coach with Coen at Kentucky. The Bucs once again stiff-armed Coen. For background, teams cannot block assistants from interviewing for coordinator jobs. And if Coen tried to create a shell position or a phony job title like “assistant head coach” to lure Carberry, then the NFL could block the move. For lateral moves, the NFL allows teams to block assistants under contract. Joe isn’t worried about Picucci. In Joe’s mind, Coen can have him. It’s Carberry that Joe is worried about. He did a wonderful job with the Bucs offensive line. Since Coen’s proposed raise is a thing of the past, Joe thinks Team Glazer should reward Carberry with a chunk of the Team Glazer loot they had initially set aside for Coen.|2025-01-31 10:51:00|224|64|2|Liam Coen|Bucs block Jags from interviewing coaches|4|Mixed sentiments with some negativity towards Coen and disagreement on coaching staff movements.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Dave B"", ""post"": ""That snake needs to be kept in a cage"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""31st,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""10:58"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Bob R"", ""post"": ""The balls on that guy."", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""31st,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""10:58"", ""am""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""FlBoy84"", ""post"": ""Agree that Carberry deserves a raise, the trick for the FO is trying to determine if his loyalty lies with the Bucs or with Coen.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/did-baker-mayfield-benefit-from-a-perfect-storm/|Did Baker Mayfield Benefit From A “Perfect Storm?”|As you no doubt heard in the latest “Ira Kaufman Podcast” where Ira welcomed JoeBucsFan.com draft guru Sean Sullivan, the age-old “Baker Mayfield doesn’t get any respect” narrative cropped up. Mayfield had an incredible season this season and in Joe’s mind was a top-three quarterback in the NFC. Maybe top-two. Yet he was only an alternate in that bastardized Pro Bowl. Insert your Rodney Dangerfield one-liner. (“Why, my wife is such a bad cook, the flies pitch in to fix the hole in the screen door.”) Now the Mayfield story Joe links to below is tied to fantasy football, Joe gets it. (As always, Joe’s idea of fantasy has absolutely nothing to do with football.) But the gist of the excerpt Joe has is more of the same: Mayfield had a nice year and he’s a nice quarterback but he’s no Lamar Jackson. Daniel Kelley of FTN says Mayfield benefitted so much from what the Bucs did right, and even from what the Bucs did wrong in 2024. It was a perfect storm for Mayfield in 2024 — a diminished Tampa defense that led to high-offense game scripts, an offensive system that worked in his favor, and more rushing success than Mayfield has ever had before. Before 2024, he hadn’t ever run for more than 165 yards in a season and hadn’t had more than 1 rushing score since 2019, but he set a career-high with 378 yards last year and scored three times on the ground. That’s a bad thing? So Mayfield played better because the offense fit him and a strong running game made defenses play more honestly? The nerve of Mayfield! What does Kelley think Mayfield is supposed to do, lay down and tank because his offense is better? Did Kelly apply the same standards to Jackson in Baltimore because he finally has good receivers and just this year had a Hall of Fame running back? You and Joe know the answer to that. Besides, Mayfield posted solid numbers and played well when both of his stud receivers, Mike Evans and Chris Godwin, were each out with injuries. If anything, Mayfield should be applauded. Folks shouldn’t look under rocks for reasons to knock him. Sullivan railed on Ira’s pod about the lack of respect Mayfield gets. Joe said what Joe has claimed for well over a year: way too many folks think of Mayfield as the struggling Browns quarterback or the Stinking Panthers quarterback that hit rock bottom. And because of that, it would take Mayfield at least three consecutive strong seasons to bury his past image and reputation. |2025-01-31 10:30:00|432|37|6|Baker Mayfield|Mayfield's success questioned due to favorable circumstances|7|Mixed sentiment with praise for Baker's abilities but also frustration with media narratives and lack of respect.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Tbbucs3"", ""post"": ""NFL teams cant seem to process that Baker Mayfield is a great quarterback\u2026.so instead they hire all his OCs cause they think his they\u2019re are the reason for his success.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/todd-bowles-and-the-pass-defense/|Todd Bowles And The Pass Defense|Joe is beginning to wonder if injuries to Antoine Winfield really started a domino effect that screwed up the Bucs’ pass defense for much of this season. When Todd Bowles last spoke to the local pen and mic club the day after the wild card round loss to the Commandos, the head coach was asked how much he was able to deploy the defense that he wanted because of all the injuries on defense. Bowles sort of danced around the question. In a roundabout way, he admitted his defense(s) were crafted to the available players. Winfield missed eight games and in all but the season opener, Winfield was hobbled to a degree. “It’s not so much about deploying a defense as it is about executing what we call,” Bowles said. “I thought those guys, for the most part, did a good job of coming in and executing what we called, with what they can do well. That was the defense we were going to play. “We had a chance to be successful if they executed the defense and they did a good job after the Bye Week of coming in and doing that, so I was proud of them for that.” In the same presser, Joe asked Bowles if Winfield’s foot, injured late in Week 1 against Washington, messed up his entire season. Bowles wouldn’t answer whether Winfield was ever 100 percent after that injury. When he did play, he was banged up. It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to figure out Winfield, an All-Pro in 2023, was and is a critical cog to the Bucs defense. Did Winfield’s early injury indirectly Pearl Harbor the Bucs defense, and was that why the pass defense played like @ss? (It sure didn’t help when Jordan Whitehead and Jamel Dean and others got hurt as well.) Ira Talks OC Candidate Nate Scheelhaase, Mike Evans Extension, Fresh Take On Bucs’ 4th-And-3 Decision Vs.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/nfl-suits-believe-bucs-will-try-to-keep-chris-godwin/|NFL Suits Believe Bucs Will Try To Keep Chris Godwin|This week the PFF tribe tried to push the notion that receiver is a draft priority for the Bucs this year. Joe nearly spilled his beer. With a heinously thin insider linebacker roster (even worse if Lavonte David retires) and a rotten pass defense, Joe cannot believe someone who allegedly makes their living in football would have the stones to suggest on a public forum that receiver would be a priority for the Bucs over inside linebacker, corner or edge rusher. Good grief! Now Joe understands that veteran receiver and fan favorite Chris Goddwin (a Joe favorite, too) could become a free agent in less than six weeks. Joe expects the Bucs would try to keep one of the better receivers in the game. And it seems those who are paid seven figures to run NFL teams agree with Joe. Jeremy Fowler of BSPN has been working his contacts in NFL offices and shared consistent feedback he is receiving about Godwin. Fowler’s latest: Multiple execs expect the Bucs to try to re-sign Godwin, who has that Buc-for-life feel similar to Mike Evans. Joe knows the Bucs love Godwin a lot. And why wouldn’t they? It was a damn shame he got hurt this year because Godwin appeared to be having one of his best seasons. Since Godwin will be deemed damaged goods by some teams because of his ankle injury, those teams will be scared off, which could drive the price down on Godwin if he gets to the open market. So perhaps the Bucs may get a good deal. Of course, all it takes is for one team to drop a chunk of cash in Godwin’s lap to mess things up. Yeah, Joe is looking right at you, Liam Coen in Jacksonville. Ira Talks OC Candidate Nate Scheelhaase, Mike Evans Extension, Fresh Take On Bucs’ 4th-And-3 Decision Vs.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/creeping-ben-bredeson-hatred/|Creeping Ben Bredeson Hatred|Joe has noticed over the past week or so that some Bucs fans are anxious to dump left guard Ben Bredeson. Joe doesn’t see why. When it comes to offensive line play, Joe’s standards and many fans’ standards are like the difference between awful comedian Kathy Griffin and famed ring card girl Sydney Thomas. But it isn’t just some Bucs fans who want to run off Bredeson. Jordan Dajani of CBS thinks the Bucs should let Bredeson walk, too. And replace him with — wait for it — a Bears guard! Bears left guard Teven Jenkins could be a replacement for Ben Bredeson when it comes to improving Tampa Bay’s rushing attack. Someone needs to tip off this Dajani. We aren’t talking the 2022 Bucs or the 2023 Bucs, which had the absolute worst rushing game in the NFL. This past season’s Bucs had the No. 4 rushing attack in the league. Hello? There is a reason rookie QB Caleb Williams was running for his life. The Bears have an atrocious offensive line. The Bucs had one of the best. So this guy Dajani is of the mind the Bucs need to run off one of their starters to replace him with a dude from one of the league’s worst offensive lines. Brilliant! The fact this Dajani thinks the Bucs’ rushing attack needs to improve (when the pass defense is just horrible), well, that premise tells Joe that Dajani either didn’t watch the Bucs this past year or is simply out to lunch. C’mon, CBS, you can do better! As for Bredeson? He’s solid. He’s likely inexpensive. And he started on one of the better lines in the game on one of the best offenses in the game. Joe doesn’t understand the problem here. (Believe it or not, the free agency dinner bell rings for Bredeson and he rest of the NFL in less than six weeks.)
