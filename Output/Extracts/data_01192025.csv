https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/vita-vea-no-83/|Vita Vea No. 83|Todd Bowles was right. Last spring and summer, it seemed from the urging of Bowles, Bucs monster defensive tackle Vita Vea dropped weight. Vea, always a quiet guy, wasn’t seen around these parts in the offseason and rarely was a photo of him found on social media. That changed when Vita showed up for the University of Washington’s spring game. He looked like he lost a grade school softball player. The weight loss didn’t prevent Vea from playing really good ball this past season. So much so that Seth Walder of BSPN, a man who never met a number he didn’t like, selected Vea as his No. 83 most valuable player in the NFL. Was Vea’s weight loss a key to his success? Well, one could argue Vea gained the weight back as the season progressed. However, for the first time since 2021, Vea played in 16 games. And he logged the most snaps in his career (705) since 2019. The Bucs finished the regular season fourth in rushing yards allowed, once again a stingy defense to run against. A big reason for that is Vea, who also had a career-high seven sacks.|2025-01-19 15:00:00|193|45|7|Vita Vea|Vea’s weight loss contributes to successful NFL season.|4|Comments range from critical to supportive of players, coaches, and teams.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""JimBobBuc"", ""post"": ""I think VV gained weight as the season went on.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/a-tale-of-two-bucs-reactions-buccaneers/|A Tale Of Two Bucs’ Reactions|In life and in sports, sometimes how a person reacts instantly to a situation says a lot about who they are — and sometimes it’s completely unfair to judge that instant reaction. So the Bucs’ gut-wrenching lost fumble at their own 12 yard line last Sunday was a massive turning point in Tampa Bay’s 23-20 loss to Washington. The fourth-quarter playcall was a jet sweep and Baker Mayfield and receiver Jalen McMillan botched the handoff exchange. Each immediately knew the play went wrong and the ball was in jeopardy. Mayfield’s reaction was to whip his body around and dive head first into the area of the ball. McMillan? He played spectator and drifted away from the play. Joe saw the very different responses from Mayfield and McMillan on replay, but it really stood out again for Joe on an official Commanders mic’d up video segment that featured a different angle on the play. (The screenshot above is from that video). McMillan is No. 15; Mayfield is the guy who dove head first at Bobby Wagner and has his buttocks in the air. Is it fair to judge McMillan on his split-second decision? Sure, but Joe’s not sure it’s worth making much of it. Regardless, every team could use a few more guys wired like Mayfield. CHAOS!

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/advance-scout-calijah-kancey/|Advance Scout Calijah Kancey|At 23 years old this season, defensive tackle Calijah Kancey had a lot on his plate. Buccaneers defensive line coach/stop-the-run coordinator Kacy Rodgers noted that Kancey is tasked with more than just practicing and listening to coaches during game weeks. The second-year man served as a chief advance scout. And per Rodgers, Kancey was all-in for that role. “When we start our individual prep for a team, you know, each one of them is assigned an assignment, a personnel group, in the run game,” Rodgers told the Buccaneers Radio Network. “Calijah’s assignment is the O-line. So he tells us, ‘This is their O-line. This guy struggles with this move. This guy, (etc.) …’ And he is so passionate about it. He put the time in and it just kind of works for that group.” The Bucs’ run defense had another strong season, ranking 10th in yards per carry, and they allowed the fourth-fewest rushing yards. The numbers were similar to last season. Joe thinks it’s very cool that Rodgers has Kancey present a full scouting report on opposing offensive lines. Joe hopes that video finds its way to the Buccaneers’ website one day. Man, if the Bucs could only pull their pass defense out of the sewer, they could be special.|2025-01-19 11:59:00|211|26|8|Calijah Kancey|Young player excels as chief advance scout for Buccaneers' defense.|2|Mixed sentiments with negativity outweighing positivity.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""BallHawk75"", ""post"": ""If if was a skiff we\u2019d all go sailing."", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""19th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""12:05"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Aqualung"", ""post"": ""To pull the pass defense out of the sewer,  Jason and the Glazers need to help Bowles understand that for that purpose, and the good of the team, the Bucs must hire a full time defensive coordinator, so Coach can finally stop trying to do two jobs and be able to focus on the myriad details of being a head coach that he currently doesn\u2019t have time for."", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""19th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""12:17"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""ModHairKen"", ""post"": ""Future Head Coach.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/jalen-mcmillan-was-under-the-radar/|Jalen McMillan Was Under The Radar|Those who follow Shaun King on Twitter — you know, one of only four Bucs quarterbacks to lead the franchise to the NFC title game — know that he pounded the drum in the weeks leading up to the 2024 draft that Brian Thomas was the best receiver to be had on draft weekend. Of course, Thomas played for LSU, one of the two receiver factories in college ball. People knew who he was. Marvin Harrison, a product of the other receiver factory in college ball, the Ohio State, everyone knew about him, too. Not only was he an otherworldly talent, it also helped to have a Hall of Fame receiver dad with the same name. Like a B-2 bomber flying tree level under radar at a pregame flyover, here comes Jalen McMillan in the third round, scooped up by Bucs AC/DC-loving general manager Jason Licht. Joe is not saying McMillan is a better receiver than Thomas, who the Jags got with the 23rd overall pick. But so far, McMillan put up numbers equal to Harrison, who Arizona was grabbed fourth overall. This season, McMillan and Harrison each had eight touchdowns. Harrison did have 885 yards receiving; McMillan had 461. Scoring, specifically touchdowns, is the name of the game. And down the stretch when the Bucs needed touchdowns, McMillan delivered. So while McMillan is not be as good as Thomas (10 touchdowns, 1,282 yards), Joe believes the Bucs got far more value this season in McMillan than the Cardinals got with Harrison.|2025-01-19 10:00:00|252|25|6|Jalen McMillan|McMillan emerges as promising wide receiver prospect under the radar.|4|Mixed sentiments on McMillan's potential and performance, varying from optimism to criticism.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""RustyRhinos"", ""post"": ""McMillion was a great draft choice."", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""19th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""10:07"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Jeff"", ""post"": ""His build is too slight for the NFL.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/at-least-you-know-youre-picking-the-right-guy/|“At Least You Know You’re Picking The Right Guy”|On Monday, when Bucs coach Todd Bowles had his last news conference for the 2024 season to wrap up the year that was, he seemed like he was bracing for offensive coordinator Liam Coen to leave the team. And based on what Bowles told Joe back at the combine two years ago, Bowles did not relish yet another round of interviewing prospective offensive coordinators. The first offensive coordinator Bowles selected for the Bucs, Dave Canales, left a year ago to take the head coach gig with the Stinking Panthers. In 2024, Bowles hit a home run with Coen. The only known interview Coen has had this month has been with the Jags. Bowles was trying to look at the bright side of teams considering Coen for a head coach opening. “Me and Liam are very close – we have these types of conversations, what to expect from an interview and everything else,” Bowles said. “At least you know you’re picking the right guy. We’ll see what happens going forward from there.” Bowles noted that if your assistants are not interviewing for jobs, then maybe something is wrong. “If they’re not talking about your guys for interviews, then you’re probably not doing it right,” Bowles added. Joe is not aware of any Bucs defensive assistants who have interviewed for the various head coaching openings in the NFL. That’s not to say none have. But if a Bucs defensive assistant has interviewed for a job, the team or teams are doing a good job keeping that under wraps.|2025-01-19 08:00:00|256|48|7|Todd Bowles|Optimistic outlook on offensive coordinator potential departure.|4|Mixed sentiments ranging from optimism about potential staff moves to frustration and disappointment with coaching decisions.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Drunk Bucs Fan"", ""post"": ""If we are fortunate enough to get the news Coen is staying, the staff moves the following two weeks will be very interesting.
