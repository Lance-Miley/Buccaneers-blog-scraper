So Joe was surprised when Canales punted on a Bucs question this week as his team prepares to play Tampa Bay on Sunday. Canales told local media in Charlotte that Todd Bowles has a sophisticated Bucs defense with a unique gameplan for each opponent, so the Panthers won’t focus their preparation on Canales’ inside knowledge of Bowles’ schemes. Then Canales offered an unsolicited take on the Bucs offense. “Liam Coen’s doing a great job with Baker and the whole group, and just mixing up the different things that they do — under center, in the gun, a lot of variety,” Canales said. “A really cool offense to watch, you know, as we watch a lot of crossover tape. So there’s a bunch of good stuff coming out of Tampa.” Nice share by Canales, but then he was asked the obvious question of the Bucs offense, “What are they doing differently than what you did?” Canales didn’t bite. He passed on comparing the Bucs offenses of the past two seasons. “I don’t really want to get into specifics of the scheme,” he said. This season, the Bucs average a touchdown more per game than Canales’ unit did in 2023.|2024-11-29 21:13:00|229|14|7|Dave Canales|Canales praises Liam Coen but avoids comparing offenses.|3|Mixed sentiments range from dismissive and critical to appreciative and optimistic.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""August 1976 Buc"", ""post"": ""Dave\u2019s response\u2026\u2026Like a cow looking at a new gate \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02"", ""post_time"": [""November"", ""29th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""10:03"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Mac"", ""post"": ""Motion is a big part of it for sure.

Fingers officially are crossed for All-World left tackle Tristan Wirfs to return from his sprained knee on Sunday. Wirfs missed last Sunday’s game and backup Justin Skule played darn well in his absence. Bucs head coach Todd Bowles said there’s a lot of confidence in Skule at One Buc. Rookie nickel cornerback Tykee Smith has been ruled out, per Bowles, who said Smith’s deep bruise has yet to heal. Also on the sidelines injured will be safety Jordan Whitehead (pec) and milk carton candidate/outside linebacker Markees Watts (knee). What exactly about Tristan Wirfs? We’ll find out 90 minutes before kickoff Sunday, Bowles cautioned. “He’s in question,” Bowles said today. “Another game-time [decision].” It seems Bowles isn’t sweating Wirfs. Skule fared well against Burns on Sunday (Baker Mayfield wasn’t sacked and was only hit twice), “We’re not trying to rush [Wirfs] back anyway, but Skule did a decent job last week,” Bowles said. If Skule can hold his own against Burns — which he did — Skule shouldn’t be abused by the lousy Stinking Panthers defense.|2024-11-29 13:51:00|181|12|7|Tristan Wirfs|Wirfs injured|4|Mixed sentiments on players' injuries, concerns about defense, praise for Skules, and criticism of decisions.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""GoneGator"", ""post"": ""More concerned about Tykee than Wirfs.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/11/rich-eisen-bucs-will-be-a-10-7-wild-card-team/|Rich Eisen: Bucs Will Be A 10-7 Wild Card Team|So the signature voice of NFL Network is surely one that grabs attention in the expensive offices at One Buc Palace. That’s Rich Eisen. And in a deep dive on game schedules and what NFC teams could make the playoffs, the host of The Rich Eisen Show said the Bucs will be the final Wild Card team (No. 7 seed) with a 10-7 record. Eisen says Atlanta (6-5) will win the NFC South with the same record while the Bucs (5-6) pull out the tiebreaker card with Washington “out of their back pocket and throw it on the table.” Obviously, Eisen sees the other two Wild Card teams coming out of the NFC North. So expectations are high for Tampa Bay around the country, and that will rise significantly if the Bucs beat the Panthers on Sunday and more pundits familiarize themselves with the Bucs pumpking-pie-soft schedule. Joe wonders how much these realities have raised expectations for Team Glazer when it comes to their head coach.|2024-11-29 13:30:00|166|26|8|Rich Eisen|Bucs predicted as 10-7 Wild Card team by Eisen.|3|Mixed feelings towards Todd Bowles, uncertain future, varying opinions on his coaching abilities.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Bucs And Them"", ""post"": ""If the Bucs don\u2019t get in the playoffs or, are one & done, Bowles is good as gone.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/11/we-work-to-fkn-hard-and-were-too-fkn-good/|“We Work Too F**k’n Hard And We’re Too F**k’n Good”|So Joe’s pal and multimedia icon Rock Riley often patrols One Buc Palace for the Tampa Free Press and in a recent report, Joe heard Riley reference how defensive players have been telling him they are tired of being blasted and doubted. Joe stood up and applauded. Good. Get angry. Let the oustide noise motivate you, even though Todd Bowles says to disregard it. Joe thought some of that anger Riley heard came through in Antoine Winfield Jr.’s pregame speech captured by the Buccaneers’ official YouTube channel. It was a mic’d up segment from Sunday’s Giants-Bucs game. “Let’s send a message all motherfu**’n week. Let’s go out here and dominate,” Winfield barked. Winfield later ramped up the volume. “… …We work too fu**’n hard and we’re too fu**’n good,” he screamed full throttle. “Let’s go out here and fu**’n dominate.” Yeah, it’s just pregame woofing. That doesn’t win games. But Winfield’s overall message and tone felt pleading and spot on. Everything is on the line and the Bucs are a devoted and talented group. There is no more tomorrow, and the Bucs must go hammer the five remaining poor teams on their schedule. Nothing less is acceptable.|2024-11-29 08:39:00|197|33|8|Antoine Winfield Jr.|Buccaneers driven to dominate amidst doubt and pressure.|3|Mixed sentiments with pessimism and optimism, highlighting defensive concerns and hopes for improvement.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""PSL Bob"", ""post"": ""Why concede to the Chargers?

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/11/bryce-young-no-longer-a-stiff/|Bryce Young No Longer A Stiff|Joe understands Stinking Panthers quarterback Bryce Young is not yet a legit NFL quarterback. As a rookie he stunk and he was so bad this year he was benched. Maybe that was a good thing? In his last four starts, Young has thrown more touchdowns than picks and in those same four games, he’s thrown for over a 60 percent completion percentage. Not great numbers, but certainly progress. Against the Chiefs (and a very solid defense) Young didn’t look lost at all. Former Bucs offensive coordinator Dave Canales was hired by David Tepper to turn around Young, a former No. 1 overall pick. That seems to be happening. At least, Todd Bowles thinks so. “He’s been playing good football of late that we’ve seen,” Bowles said. “He’s been playing very good football. Dave’s positivity and his coaching, period, is a good influence on him. “It takes a while to learn offenses, no matter who you are. He’s got a good handle on it right now. I think they’ve figured each other out – they’re getting along, you can see it on the field.” The last thing the Bucs need is for Young to get off to a good start on Sunday. A young quarterback just starting to feel comfortable, the Bucs can’t let him start the game with some completions or God forbid a touchdown, and start gaining confidence. That is the key to Sunday’s game. If they can get after Young and force him into bad throws, the rest will take care of itself. If Young starts lighting up the Bucs’ woeful pass defense and gets on a roll, Joe has a hunch the Bucs will have their hands full finding a road win.|2024-11-29 08:25:00|285|33|5|Bryce Young|Young's progress in the NFL.|4|Comments show uncertainty and concern over Bucs defense's ability, but also some optimism.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Jack Sparrow"", ""post"": ""Bucs D will make him look like a Hall of Famer\u2026.."", ""post_time"": [""November"", ""29th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""8:39"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""PSL Bob"", ""post"": ""I think he\u2019s going to be pressured unlike his last few games.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/11/teeing-up-a-blowout-bucs-win/|Teeing Up A Blowout Bucs Win|Joe is fired up for another beatdown Bucs victory on Sunday. The Panthers defense is one of the worst in the NFL (30.2 points per game), and Joe saw a whole lot of loaf and quit from it Sunday in the Chiefs’ game-winning drive. The Chiefs just dropped 30 on the Panthers, which was the most points in regulation Kansas City has scored all year. And that was with the Panthers at home coming off their bye week. Before the bye? The Giants ran all over Carolina for 167 yards, a game the bumbling Giants could have won if not for their overtime fumble. Imagine that. The Giants taking a team to overtime. Consider that when asked on the Buccaneers Radio Network this week about what he sees in the Panthers’ offense, Todd Bowles paused and first mentioned Deven Thompkins (yes, that Deven Thompkins) as a dangerous player on Carolina. Thompkins has 3 catches this season for 13 yards. Sunday against the Chiefs, another ex-Buccaneer on the Carolina roster, receiver David Moore, had his best regular season game in 4 years to help keep Carolina close. Some truly special catches were had by Moore, and Joe was happy for the guy, but the Panthers can’t count on a No. 4-caliber receiver playing like that consistently. The Panthers were not good in the red zone Sunday but rallied for a late touchdown and a 2-point conversion. Is Panthers QB Bryce Young playing better? Yes, but that doesn’t say much, and Joe sees a guy that throws a lot of ugly incompletions — and a guy that will help the Bucs’ defense get off the field. If the Bucs play like they did against the Giants on Sunday, then “this Joe” sees a similar commanding result. The Bucs offense just has too much firepower and no NFL team allows more first downs than the Panthers. Joe also could see a Panthers letdown after an emotional loss to the Chiefs, which felt like Carolina’s Super Bowl coming off their bye.|2024-11-29 08:22:00|337|19|5|Joe|Predicting a confident Buccaneers win against the struggling Panthers.|5|Mixed sentiments about the game, varying expectations from blowout win to potential shock defeat.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""A Bucs Fan"", ""post"": ""It really should be 30-0 by the third quarter."", ""post_time"": [""November"", ""29th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""8:26"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Buc4evr"", ""post"": ""Ha, it\u2019s the Bucs defense \u2026.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/11/todd-bowles-discusses-jordan-whiteheads-injury/|Todd Bowles Discusses Jordan Whitehead Injury|So Bucs safety Jordan Whitehead had a pec injury of some sort against the Giants. Was it torn? That was the initial diagnosis. However. after Whitehead had his MRI tests returned, the Bucs learned Whitehead wouldn’t need surgery. At least not yet. So Whitehead hopes to be able to play through his injury after an undetermined amount of weeks off. On Wednesday, Joe asked Todd Bowles if he had a guesstimate how long Whitehead would need to get back on the field and if he can play effectively with one wing. “I don’t know [what] my estimate is because some people come back quicker, and some people stay out longer,” Bowles replied. “I just try to hear what the trainers tell me and listen to how he progresses. “When he’s out there, I’ll be happy. That’s the best I can tell you.” A torn (?) pec is damn painful. If people remember the play Whitehead immediately ran off the field and almost right away the Bucs announced he would not return. When a negative injury report is issued that quickly, you know it is a bad injury. So Whitehead is going to try to gut it out, whenever that is. That, friends, is a warrior. And Bowles acknowledged Whitehead is a tough hombre. “Some people can play through injuries but it’s a significant injury for him, unfortunately,” Bowles said. “Jordan is tough – he’s one of the toughest guys we’ve got. If he can get back, he’s going to get back.” Joe has wondered if the Bucs have buyer’s remorse with Whitehead returning in free agency. He isn’t the same player who helped the Bucs win the Super Bowl four years ago. There were a couple of plays where Joe wondered about Whitehead’s effort. But if Whitehead plays with a messed up pec, that’s real-man, warrior stuff. Any doubt of effort in Joe’s mind is out the window if Whitehead plays through that.|2024-11-29 07:00:00|323|5|6|Jordan Whitehead|Whitehead hopes to play through significant pec injury|4|Mixed opinions on Whitehead's return, with concerns over performance and healing time variability.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""A Bucs Fan"", ""post"": ""Didn\u2019t TJ Watt come back in six weeks from a pec tear a couple of seasons ago?

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/11/red-zone-is-the-green-zone-for-bucs/|Red Zone Is The Green Zone For Bucs|If Joe asked a random Bucs fan if Todd Monken is a good offensive coordinator, Joe is pretty confident the answer would be damn near unanimous. The answer would be “yes.” So if Monken gets so much love — and he should — then how about Bucs offensive coordinator Liam Coen? Joe thought it was interesting that in the money plays for NFL offenses, only Monken is getting more production from his offense than Coen and the Bucs. Per Rich Hribar of Sharp Football Analysis, only one team scores more touchdowns from the red zone than Tampa Bay. That would be Monken’s Crows. The Buccaneers have converted 69.8% (30-of-43) of their red zone possessions for touchdowns, 2nd in the NFL behind the Ravens (77.8%). This is a good thing for a variety of reasons. The biggest for Joe deals with the Bucs defense. Yeah, Joe knows the defense beat the snot out of Tommy Cutlets and the Giants last week. Still, the Bucs defense, unless it really turns things around in the next six games, is not good. So to compensate, the Bucs have to score touchdowns, not field goals. The Bucs having the second-highest percentage of touchdowns per visits to the red zone is what Joe calls getting the job done.|2024-11-29 03:45:00|212|3|7.5|Bucs|High praise for Bucs' offensive coordinators in red zone efficiency.|7|Mixed sentiment with gratitude and optimism expressed, but also some doubt and questioning.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Dave Pear"", ""post"": ""Thanks to Todd.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/11/envisioning-bucs-taking-advantage-of-dixie-chicks-choking/|Envisioning Bucs Taking Advantage Of Dixie Chicks’ Choking|The Dixie Chicks are playing badly and they’re playing a tough second half of the season. The Bucs have a pumpkin-pie-soft schedule and looked like a winning team by clobbering the Giants in the first half on Sunday. As a result, Dan Graziano of BSPN doesn’t believe it is fake news to believe the Bucs can turn things around and play meaningful football in January. Why is Graziano slightly confident? Well, Atlanta is choking like dogs and the Bucs are playoff-run battle-tested. I can absolutely see the Falcons falling apart and the Bucs sneaking in for a fourth straight division title. But it’s important to remember that the Falcons have a one-game lead and have already won both head-to-head matchups. If the Buccaneers are going to win this division, they will have to outright pass the Falcons. Meaning, if Atlanta goes 3-3 the rest of the way, Tampa Bay likely must go 5-1 to come out ahead. That’s a lot to ask. “This Joe” has been all being uncomfortable expecting a bad team, now 5-6, will win six out of seven games to close a season.  The Bucs already chalked up a win last week in New Jersey. But yeah, the Bucs are battle-tested in making playoff runs. The Bucs won the division the past two seasons by the skin of their teeth, specifically last year when needing one last win to secure the title, the Bucs damn near lost to the Stinking Panthers. Still, winning six of seven games is a tall order, even for a good team.|2024-11-29 00:00:00|259|14|7|Bucs|Bucs may have a chance at playoff run.|3|Mixed sentiment with concerns about defense and coaching, but some optimism about upcoming games.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""BucsBeast"", ""post"": ""The offense can score points.
