The only way Joe’s weekend would have been better (Joe even went 5-0 in college basketball wagering!) was if Joe awakened from a nap/dream to learn Bucs AC/DC-loving general manager Jason Licht broke down and signed a proven edge rusher. Now, last year there were times when it appeared David may have lost a step, that Father Time might have been nudging him. David was still a strong linebacker but he didn’t appear to be his usual Hall-of-Fame-level player. Just a hair below. Well, not only does NextGen Stats suggest that analysis is nonsense, but NextGen Stats believes David was as quick as any off-the-ball linebacker in the game. Last season, David played a team-high 96.6 percent of defensive snaps in the blitz-heavy scheme and recorded 23 quick pressures to lead all off-ball linebackers. So what are “quick pressures,” you ask? A quick pressure is when a guy rushes the quarterback and is able to put pressure on him in less than 2.5 seconds. Per NextGen Stats’ GPS readings of chips in players’ equipment, no off-the-ball linebacker was quicker getting after the quarterback. Oh, and he’s now 35. Father Time has a battle on his hands with ol’ No. 54.|2025-03-09 23:33:00|223|12|5|Lavonte David|David defying age and still excelling as linebacker.|4|Mixed sentiments towards Lavonte David's performance and future in the team.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Aqualung"", ""post"": ""Thank you Joe.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/report-chris-godwins-plan-is-to-test-open-market/|Report: Chris Godwin’s Plan Is To Test Open Market|The Bucs have until Wednesday afternoon to re-up franchise favorite Chris Godwin before he fully hits the free market. Roughly two weeks ago, the Bucs and Godwin’s camp worked out a two-week extension to get him re-signed and avoid Tampa Bay a nasty salary cap hit. That just happens to coincide with the free agency dinner bell ringing on Wednesday. To be clear: noon today starts legal tampering, where free agents verbally can agree to contracts. However, nothing is set in stone until Wednesday when the dinner bell rings. Illegal tampering began at the combine. So will the Bucs get a deal done with Godwin? It seems Godwin’s agent planted a nugget into the lap of a friendly NFL reporter to suggest the Bucs better up the ante. Dianna Russini of The Athletic twittered last night that Godwin’s goal (read: his agent’s goal) has always been to see what other teams may offer.  Joe understands why Godwin wants to see what is out there because this very likely could be his final big bite at the NFL salary apple. Godwin just turned 29. There aren’t a lot of 30+ year old receivers balling out in the NFL.|2025-03-09 23:30:00|197|41|7|Chris Godwin|Godwin to test market|4|Mixed feelings on Godwin's future with focus on injuries, contract, and potential impact on team.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Simeon4HOF"", ""post"": ""Chris Godwin doesn\u2019t feel valued by Bucs at this point, and the Bucs haven\u2019t helped matters in recent weeks.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/bucs-to-have-new-name-for-stadium-in/|Bucs To Have New Name For Stadium|The Bucs may or may not have a new stadium at the end of this decade. But the current Bucs’ crib will be glossed with a new official name in a couple of years. (No, Joe never types the official name of The Licht House because Joe reasons if the financial outfit based in St. Petersburg can easily cough up millions annually to have its name plastered on the Bucs’ crib, then they can surely afford to cut Joe a modest check each year rather than Joe handing out multiple pieces of free daily advertising 24/7/365. The least this outfit could do would be to give Joe a break on wealth management services. You know, something for the effort? So Joe only finds it fair to not give them free daily advertising. Fair is fair. Of course, Joe is easy to reach and open-minded if someone from said financial outfit wants to discuss this matter.) This information comes by way of Bret McCormick and Ben Fischer of the Sports Business Journal. The piece really doesn’t answer a lot of questions on the future of the Bucs’ current stadium or a potential new home in the otherwise mostly dry article. McCormick and Fischer did suggest the reason there are zero plans or efforts to build the Rays a stadium in Tampa is that officials in Tampa are loading their coffers preparing for what’s likely around the corner in a few years with the Bucs: either a major stadium renovation or a brand new crib. Also, the article notes, don’t forget about the almost 30-year old Ice Palace and the Lightning. One item in the SBJ article noted that the NFL informed Tampa authorities that because the last Super Bowl the city hosted happened during the throes of The Sickness in February 2021, Tampa likely would be pushed to the front of the line to host another if the city bids. However, there is one major caveat to that wink-and-nod: The NFL will not consider the bid seriously unless The Licht House is renovated. A second item caught Joe’s attention: Apparently, the current stadium does not generate rivers of cash like many other modern stadiums (or for the English teachers out there, “stadia”). But it’s also a big story for the rest of the NFL, where the bar keeps getting higher for revenue and venue expectations. The Bucs are somewhere between the 16th- and 20th-most valuable franchise in the NFL, according to recent public estimates, despite playing in the 11th-largest media market — an incongruity that likely reflects Raymond James’ outdated revenue-generation potential and the Bucs’ hands-off approach to the stadium’s overall business. The key element of this SBJ story for Joe is that The Licht House will have a new official name no later than 2028 season. The Raymond James naming-rights deal expires in 2027, too; the financial institution has already informed the team it’s not renewing … So maybe, just maybe, whomever purchases naming rights in a couple of years will play ball with Joe? The financial outfit in St. Petersburg never has. And Joe’s rates are far more reasonable.|2025-03-09 23:00:00|520|37|7|Bucs stadium renaming|Potential new stadium or renovation|4|Mixed feelings about stadium naming, ranging from optimism to skepticism and frustration.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""HC Grover"", ""post"": ""Maybe 50 bucks for a beer and 25 for a bag of popcorn?"", ""post_time"": [""March"", ""10th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""12:07"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Tony"", ""post"": ""Maybe worry more about signing some FAs to help the D instead of worrying about the name of the stadium."", ""post_time"": [""March"", ""10th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""12:10"", ""am""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""Simeon4HOF"", ""post"": ""Surely we will have an Edge Rusher that can Sack the QB and a full WR core by then.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/harold-landry-will-join-the-patriots/|Harold Landry Will Join The Patriots|Joe’s edge rusher fantasies will be less intense tonight. They’ll still be there but with Myles Garrett holding a new deal and stud free agent edge rusher Harold Landry freshly inking a new contracts with New England, Joe will have less sack artists from which to choose. Per NFL Network. Landry, with 30-plus sacks over the past three seasons, got $43.5 million on a three-year deal with New England with about 60 percent of that cash guaranteed.  Man, Joe really would have loved to see him in a Bucs uniform. It’s ok. Breathe easy. There are still other avenues for the Bucs to fortify their edge rush, and Joe isn’t referring to re-signing overtime hero Anthony Nelson. The free agency siren officially blows at noon tomorrow. Landry, a seven-year veteran, was cut last week by the Titans and free to negotiate.|2025-03-09 18:34:00|141|69|7|Harold Landry|Landry joins Patriots|3|Mixed sentiments with concerns about free agency moves and trust in the organization.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Kgh4life"", ""post"": ""If the Bucs don\u2019t get any edge rushers in free agency, I don\u2019t wanna hear them b*tch and moan about lack of a pass rush."", ""post_time"": [""March"", ""9th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""7:38"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Allbuccedup"", ""post"": ""Figure\u2019s"", ""post_time"": [""March"", ""9th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""7:41"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""First Last"", ""post"": ""I would rather be relevant and smart than make a bang move thinking it\u2019ll take us to the Superbowl.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/myles-garrett-will-stay-in-cleveland/|Myles Garrett Will Stay In Cleveland|Monster edge rusher Myles Garrett will not be a Buccaneer in 2025. Garrett, per ESPN, just signed a monster contract extension that will put $40 million per year in his pocket with $123.5 million in guaranteed money. And he doesn’t even play quarterback. Wow. Garrett had been asking for a trade and, well, money seemed to soothe him. Screw playing for contender. The bag is super fat and Garrett flushed his desire to play for a winner the way Joe would jump head first on a tray of Hooters boneless wings. Garrett’s new contract, on the heels of edge beast Maxx Crosby restructuring for record money with the Las Vegas Bradys last week, surely means Trey Hendrickson will want at least $30 million plus this season. The NFL sacks leader was given permission by the Bengals to seek a trade. Hendrickson, with 17 1/2 sacks in each of the past two seasons, is due around $16 million in 2025. On this peaceful Sunday, Joe will just add that there’s a reason teams are willing to pay so much for edge rushers, though one could counter by saying there’s a reason Cleveland and Vegas have been perennial losers.|2025-03-09 11:16:00|197|72|3|Myles Garrett|Contract extension with Cleveland Browns|2|Mixed sentiments on player contracts and team management.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Allbuccedup"", ""post"": ""Between Garretts and Watsons contract I don\u2019t how they pay the rest of the team."", ""post_time"": [""March"", ""9th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""12:22"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""FilthyAnimal"", ""post"": ""He wasn\u2019t coming to Tampa anyway."", ""post_time"": [""March"", ""9th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""12:23"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""Steve"", ""post"": ""So much for only playing for the Super Bowl and not money"", ""post_time"": [""March"", ""9th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""12:24"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter3"": {""username"": ""Allen Lofton"", ""post"": ""They pay because finding the.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/high-seas-unease-for-jamel-dean/|High Seas Unease For Jamel Dean?|Man overboard? Joe is confident there is consensus among Bucs fans that starting cornerback Jamel Dean isn’t worth the $12.5 million he’s slated to earn for the 2025 season. Not enough picks, not enough health and not enough dawg in his game; but maybe Dean is worth $6 or $8 million? If the Bucs cut Dean, they’ll save roughly $8.5 million in 2025 salary cap room. They’d also be a lot thinner at corner. Dean can play when he’s healthy, but he’s hurt too often for Joe’s taste. Might the Bucs be negotiating with Dean on a pay cut before Wednesday’s start of the new league year? “This Joe” would feel good about Dean coming back at less money and the Bucs also adding quality outside cornerback help. Per Joe’s research, the Bucs have time. Dean’s 2025 contract is not guaranteed, so he might only score his current full salary by making the opening day roster. (See Michael Clayton’s September 2010 release.) What intrigues Joe is that Dean is now on a Buccaneers-sponsored cruise in the Caribbean. The team put its name on a fan-focused frolic on the high seas that ends tomorrow. Fans were promised a long list of player attendees in exchange for their cash. Dean was on the list. Might Dean get thrown overboard the moment he steps off the boat? That sure would feel a little slimy. Or are the Bucs waiting for Dean to be immersed in Bucs love and then hit him with a salary slash offer Monday evening? Joe is very intrigued to see how the Bucs approach Dean’s status. And remember, the answer might not come until late August.|2025-03-09 10:04:00|277|58|2|Jamel Dean|Buccaneers evaluate cornerback's salary worth|2|Mixed sentiment towards Jamel Dean, leaning towards pessimistic views on his performance and reliability.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Gipper"", ""post"": ""Almost any young CB from the combine would be an improvement over Mr. Dean.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/adam-schefter-chargers-will-work-to-try-to-keep-khalil-mack/|Adam Schefter: Chargers Will Work To Keep Khalil Mack|Joe understands a lot of Bucs fans are hoping Chargers superbeast edge rusher Khalil Mack somehow escapes Los Angeles and a miracle happens and he lands in Tampa. Adam Schefter wouldn’t bank on that because he doesn’t think Mack hitting the open market this week is likely. Schefter sat down with Big Cat and PFT Commenter on the Barstool Sports podcast “Pardon My Take.” There, Schefter explained why he wouldn’t gamble on Mack leaving. “Khalil Mack, the Chargers are definitely trying to get back,” Schefter said. “The Chargers are going to work to get back Khalil Mack.” Schefter believed the handwriting was on the wall for a Mack return to Los Angeles when the Chargers released Joey Bosa as a cap casualty. “I can’t imagine [the Chargers lose] both guys, let’s see how that works out for them,” Schefter said. Schefter also guessed there is renewed interest and value in pass rushers league-wide as a result of the Eagles copying the Bucs method to beat the Chiefs in the Super Bowl:  a fierce, ferocious and an unyielding pass rush. That, Schefter said, will drive the price up on the already premium position. “I think these guys are gonna get more money than people are expecting,” Schefter said. “And I think the Eagles helped make the pass rushers more money in this range market.” That isn’t a good sign. The Bucs are already highly skittish of buying a legitimate edge rusher. If it now costs more money, that probably lessens the chance the Bucs address the biggest hole on their roster in free agency.|2025-03-09 08:33:00|263|18|5|Khalil Mack|Chargers working to keep Mack in Los Angeles.|4|Mixed sentiments on team strategy and acquisitions, with some hope for improvement.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""SteveK"", ""post"": ""Trade one, sign one and draft one.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/jason-licht-talks-edge-rushers-huge-money-and-shock/|Jason Licht Talks Edge Rushers: “Huge Money” And “Shock”|Buccaneers Ring of Honor general manager Jason Licht answered the edge rush question on New Port Richey’s most popular podcast. That would be the Ira Kaufman Podcast, named for The Sage of Tampa Bay Sports and the king of New Port Richey. Yes, Licht is seeking edge rush help now. Yes, he values an edge rush. But he’s not playing daily fantasy football or buying Powerball tickets. And he feels great about two young guns on his roster. “For every one that makes it, there’s three that don’t, and you want to make sure you’re getting the right one,” Licht said of edge rushers. “And throwing money, huge money, isn’t always the answer. That can hurt you in other ways. People talk about wanting a certain player that we should trade the farm for and is going to be the answer, but why wasn’t he the answer for the team that he was on? You know, and I’m not talking about one particular player. But we’re always looking for [a top edge rusher]. “I will say that I am excited about YaYa [Diaby]. I think YaYa quietly was one of the better edge players in terms of his pressures and hurries. And I know that you don’t like to hear that; you want to hear sack production. But I think he was just almost there and he’s going to get there next year. I’m really excited about [Chris] Braswell for his second year. I think he’s going to shock a lot of people, just knowing the kind of person he is and the talent that he has. We’ll look at all avenues for edge rush. We do need some depth there. We do need some help.” So there you go. Don’t wake up tomorrow (NFL free agency starts at noon) and expect the Bucs to swing for the fences to score an edge rusher. They might, but it’s far more likely that Licht is looking to hit a clean double into left-center field. Man, Joe sure hopes Licht is right when it comes to Braswell. Joe might be in the “shock” club Licht referenced if Braswell breaks out in a great way.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/nextgen-stats-agrees-bucs-pass-defense-was-a-fail/|NextGen Stats Agree: Bucs Pass Defense Was A #Fail|What is the opposite of success? Failure. And, per NextGen Stats, the Bucs were one big #Fail defending the pass in 2024. For the second straight season, the Bucs finished fourth-worst in the NFL in passing yards allowed per game. (Interesting aside: in 2023, the only three teams that allowed more passing yards per game than the Bucs either had a new defensive coordinator or a new head coach in 2024. Those same teams all made the playoffs last year.) NextGen Stats reinforces the “baseball card stats” showing how bad the Bucs pass defense was last season. Per NextGen, the Bucs allowed the sixth-highest passing success rate. Passing success rate is when an opponent allows at least 40 percent of yards needed to convert on first downs, 60 percent on second downs and 100 percent on third or fourth downs. So it didn’t matter what down teams threw on the Bucs, they had success. As Joe has pointed out many times, the Bucs need help on all three levels of the defense and Joe believes the NextGen Stats’ data backs that up. So yeah, the Bucs need an edge rusher. And they need help at linebacker, even with Lavonte David coming back. One could argue the Bucs need help at both safety and corner. Could a healthy, rejuvenated Antoine Winfield be the answer? Yes, Joe knows Winfield was hurt all year last year.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/paying-the-price-for-myles-garrett/|Paying The Price For Myles Garrett|UPDATED: Well, someone who has a work office at One Buc Palace would bite the bullet to get a premier edge rusher. UPDATE: Myles Garrett has a giant new Browns contract. Over at Buccaneers.com, senior writer/editor Scott Smith was posed with a question from a fan. If he had the power, would he make a trade for help in the secondary, an “elite” edge rusher or beef for the defensive line? Smith answered he’d go get an edge rusher. Now Smith was quick to point out he is not speaking on behalf of the Bucs, AC/DC-loving general manager Jason Licht or Todd Bowles. And Smith does not claim he has any inside knowledge of how the Bucs’ braintrust will work on adding to the roster. Besides, Smith pointed out, there is this little thing called “tampering” he doesn’t want to be involved with. Still, Smith typed, he would pay a large ransom if the Bucs could grab edge rusher Myles Garrett. In fact, Smith said he’d cough up two first-round picks for Garrett because he believes Garrett has at least five more seasons of gas in the tank. But Smith also made a very interesting observation about edge rushers and defensive backs. Even if we’re not talking about any specific players here, I would still pick “elite pass rusher” as my first choice from the options that presented. Next would be cornerback, because I’ve long held that’s a position at which a team could reasonably add depth to in any given season, no matter who is on your depth chart. As we saw last season, cornerback depth is critical and hard to cultivate and maintain. This sounds like the Father Dungy method. And it’s a smart method. Father Dungy used to preach to his parish that a team must draft a defensive back every year because a team cannot have too many. And that’s just what the Bucs did. Each year Father Dungy was with the Bucs, Richie McKay drafted a defensive back, usually a cornerback. Smith is right about depth is in the secondary, even more so when one of your starting corners has a torrid affair with the hot tub. Still, Joe found it intriguing that even a guy working at One Buc Palace (not in football operations) can see the Bucs need a quality edge rusher.|2025-03-09 00:00:00|389|27|7|Myles Garrett|Bucs consider trading for elite edge rusher.|3|Mixed opinions on potential edge rusher acquisitions, concern about cost and team strategy.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""FilthyAnimal"", ""post"": ""They know what they need.
