https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/espn-bucs-have-no-concern-over-chris-godwins-injured-ankle/|ESPN: Bucs Have “No Concern” Over Chris Godwin’s Injured Ankle|It seems the Bucs are very confident that free agent wide receiver Chris Godwin’s surgically repaired ankle will be 100 percent. That’s the word from Jenna Laine of ESPN. In a notebook column of top free agents, Laine reports the Bucs will do their best to bring Godwin back and that his ankle is not an issue. Will the Bucs re-sign WR Chris Godwin? Let’s just get this out of the way now. Sources told ESPN the Bucs absolutely want Godwin back and will do everything in their power to make that happen, with no concern about his recovery from a dislocated left ankle in Week 7. Of course, there is precedent for them with this, having rewarded him with a three-year deal worth $60 million after he tore the ACL and MCL in his right knee in 2021. Still, conversations must be had and pen still has to hit paper. But it’s clear how the Bucs feel about him. Of course, saying they will do everything in their power to bring Godwin back and actually re-signing him are two different things. It’s common for wide receivers to begin tailing off in production once they turn 30. Godwin turns 29 in two weeks. So Godwin is likely looking at one last chance for a big bite at the NFL apple. It’s awfully tough to find work at $20 million a year outside the NFL and that’s very likely to dry up on Godwin in a few years. So the Bucs are going to have to show him the money to be able to keep him. Especially when Washington, less than two hours from Godwin’s hometown (and also his wife’s hometown), may throw a bank at Godwin to pair up with Terry McLaurin. This is why Joe is fascinated to see what Josh Grizzard has in store. If the new Bucs offensive coordinator is going to have a run-first offense, it might be difficult to convince Team Glazer that the Bucs need two $20+ million receivers.|2025-02-13 15:43:00|335|49|8|Chris Godwin|Bucs confident in re-signing Godwin despite ankle concerns.|6|Mixed sentiments on Chris Godwin's future with the team, uncertainty surrounding cap space and defense.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""BuckyBuc"", ""post"": ""Godwin is our best blocking WR on the team, not to mention the 2nd best receiver ever drafted behind Mike Evans for tampa.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/yaya-diaby-vows-to-improve/|YaYa Diaby Vows To Improve|YaYa Diaby went missing for too long last year. But the Bucs’ outside linebacker finished strong with 2.5 sacks in his last four games. Also in those four games, YaYa had seven quarterback hits. Still, for the season, YaYa was little factor with just 4.5 sacks, down from 7.5 his rookie year. That’s not the direction you want to see from a second-year player. But YaYa knows this. In fact, he took to Twitter this week and vowed that sacks will be a much bigger element of his game. “I can’t wait to prove all the doubters wrong!!” YaYa said. “Trust and believe I am an elite pass rusher (FYI watch film).” Joe has nothing against film but Joe also believes in results. Good quarterbacks are not fazed by pressure. They are very much phased when lying on the ground. If the Bucs actually break down and get an established pass rusher, Joe believes that will only benefit YaYa. A quality guy coming off the edge getting after quarterbacks certainly means fewer blockers to tangle with Vita Vea, Calijah Kancey, and yes, even YaYa. And imagine on one side of the field you have a guy that consistently gets to a quarterback and YaYa having a breakout season from the other side. The Bucs defense would be ferocious. To accomplish this, the Bucs cannot (again) bank on hope. When it comes to an edge rush, hope seems to be a favorite tactic. Hope is not nor should ever be a plan. Josh Sweat?

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/linebackers-pool-sort-of-chilly/|Linebackers Pool Sort Of Chilly|Joe doesn’t even want to think about Bucs life without Lavonte David. Sooner or later, the end will arrive. It could be in 2026. Joe doesn’t think it would come after the 2027 season. Or, sadly, it could come within the next few weeks. Joe hopes David gives the Bucs a heads-up before the free agency dinner bell rings in less than a month. Regardless, the Bucs do need an upgrade at inside linebacker next to David. It’s too bad the Bucs cannot put K.J. Britt’s heart into a body of a quicker guy. Joe has eyes on three guys and figures one of the three will be available. First, Joe has a hard time seeing the Chiefs let go of their tackling machine Nick Bolton. He could walk as a free agent. Joe liked the guy since he came out of Missouri. Man, to have him next to David, the Bucs would instantly have one of the best linebacker duos in the game. In San Francisco, the 49ers have two starting linebackers who are pending free agents. That would be De’Vondre Campbell and Dre Greenlaw. Each could come relatively cheap — if they hit the market. There’s a reason for that. Campbell, who had 79 tackles in 12 starts, will be 32 before training camp starts. Greenlaw will be 28 but he’s coming off an Achilles injury. He tried to come back from that injury last year but couldn’t make a go of it. In Campbell’s case, would you want to pair up a couple of linebackers who are on the wrong side of 32? With Greenlaw, do you bank on damaged goods? Having one linebacker at 35 (David) and the other trying to return from an Achilles, that may not be so smart. Another guy who may be a trade target is Germaine Pratt of Cincinnati. Pratt turns 29 this summer and enters the final year of his contract. He’s making noise he wants out of Cincinnati. Pratt has missed just four games the last four years, none the past two seasons. In each of the last four seaons, Pratt has increased his tackles totals. In 2024, he had 143 tackles. Since Pratt is in the final year of his contract, he could be had for less than face value. That is, of course, if stubborn Bengals strongman Mike Brown wants to play ball. He often prefers to play chicken with his disgruntled players. Joe would absolutely jump at the chance to have Bolton, would waste no time if there was a chance for Pratt, would be cautious with Campbell and would have to think long and hard about Greenlaw. No, Joe has not forgotten about SirVocea Dennis. However, Dennis — who Joe likes and thinks he can be a good player — first must prove he can stay on the field and out of the tub. Only then can Joe consider him for a starting linebacker gig.|2025-02-13 07:00:00|490|29|4|Linebackers|Evaluating potential linebackers for the Bucs roster.|4|Mixed sentiments on ILB needs, drafts, and free agency|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""MadMax"", ""post"": ""Draft Schwesinger in the 2nd"", ""post_time"": [""February"", ""13th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""7:22"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""geno711"", ""post"": ""I like Zack Baun the most then Bolton, but if going older and cheaper I would then go Bobby Wagner."", ""post_time"": [""February"", ""13th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""7:27"", ""am""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""Bucsfan81"", ""post"": ""No one with any injury history we have enough time trying to keep players on the field."", ""post_time"": [""February"", ""13th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""7:37"", ""am""]}, ""commenter3"": {""username"": ""LVMYBUCS"", ""post"": ""Off topic: Love my Bucs I just have no confidence in Todd Bowles he plays to scared for me."", ""post_time"": [""February"", ""13th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""8:34"", ""am""]}, ""commenter4"": {""username"": ""Redzone"", ""post"": ""Campbell pulled an Antonio Brown minus the striptease and calisthenics.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/until-further-notice/|Until Further Notice|Some NFL observers and maybe a few Bucs fans would take the following comment as an insult if not a swipe. It’s not meant to be and is actually better than the alternative (yeah, Joe is looking right at the slimy Saints, the Dixie Chicks and the Stinking Panthers). What is this observation? “The Tampa Bay Buccaneers have proven to be the class of the NFC South.” That’s what Frank Schwab of Yahoo! Sports typed about the Bucs in his offseason analysis. And that’s not a bad thing, but who the hell has a goal of being the pit bull of the worst litter in the league when you step out of that division and turn into a cuddly lab? Joe guesses the folks at One Buc Palace want to be that angry Doberman of the NFL like the Eagles just became. The Bucs have some elements that mirror the Eagles but not enough. Schwab notes the Bucs have a strong core. So, how do the Bucs grow from a pit bull of a bad litter (NFC South) to the big dawg of the NFL? The Bucs need an edge rusher worse than Joe needs a cold beer on a July Florida afternoon. This is just absolutely glaring. And depending on Lavonte David’s decision to continue or end his career, the Bucs may have two starting holes at inside linebacker. Unless the Bucs think Jamel Dean can stay on the field in December, January and February and Jordan Whitehead just had a fluke bad season, then you’re looking at two starting positions in the secondary in need of an upgrade. Yes, the Bucs have a core of a good team. But that defense, especially at its most important position (edge rush), boy oh boy do the Bucs need upgrades if they want to dethrone the Eagles. It’s not an impossible task. In 2023, the Bucs mopped the floor with the Eagles in the playoffs. The Bucs aren’t that far away, so long as they are aggressive next month. They cannot be satisfied with just winning the NFC South.|2025-02-13 03:45:00|348|41|5|Tampa Bay Buccaneers|Bucs striving to improve and compete at a higher level.|4|Mixed opinions on defense holes, pass rush need, player regression, coaching, and draft strategy.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""kaimaru"", ""post"": ""@Joe"", ""post_time"": [""February"", ""13th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""4:36"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Defense Rules"", ""post"": ""Joe \u2026 \u2018So, how do the Bucs grow from a pit bull of a bad litter (NFC South) to the big dawg of the NFL?

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/nextgen-stats-calijah-kancey-pulls-off-the-unthinkable/|NextGen Stats: Calijah Kancey Pulled Off The Unthinkable|OK, so when Joe first began reading the following excerpt from NextGen Stats by way of NFL.com, it didn’t appear all that great for the Bucs. The more Joe read, the better Joe felt. The Bucs were just an OK tackling team last regular season, per NextGen Stats. The NFL’s official stats outfit uses GPS modules or computer chips in football and players’ equipment to come up with their data. It’s a much, much more accurate way of data collection than dudes in Irish dorm rooms guessing by watching broadcast tape to hatch some sort of ill-suited “grade.” So recently, NextGen Stats teamed up with Amazon to concoct an AI device to study tackling. It looks at if a player is in position to make a tackle and if a defender is able to follow through with a tackle. (Clearly, this method does not determine wrapping up, which for Joe is a critical fundamental.) Overall, the Bucs were just meh in tackling last season, finishing 17th. However, after the Bucs’ bye week, the tackling significantly improved. In the weeks after the bye, the Bucs were No. 3 in tackling. It’s not a difficult puzzle to figure out who was the Bucs’ best tackler. That would be Lavonte David. However, another player really overshadowed David. Bucs defensive tackle Calijah Kancey did not miss one tackle last year, per NextGen Stats. Sure, Kancey only played in a dozen games as he hurt his calf in training camp. Again. But when Kancey was on the field he got the job done. Per NextGen Stats, Kancey was the only player in the NFL last year who did not have a missed tackle. Joe’s a big Kancey guy. Joe thinks he’s one of the best pass rushing defensive tackles. And now we have evidence Kancey is also a superior defender against the run. What a steal this guy was for a 19th overall pick by Bucs AC/DC-loving general manager Jason Licht. Gee, 19th overall? Sounds familiar. Isn’t that where the Bucs pick this year? Why yes, yes they do.|2025-02-13 00:00:00|344|25|8|Calijah Kancey|Bucs player excels in tackling|5|Mixed sentiment towards player Kancey, with concerns about missed tackles and injuries.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""ReeeBarrr"", ""post"": ""That\u2019s pretty wild.
