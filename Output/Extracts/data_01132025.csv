https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/todd-bowles-injuries-doomed-antoine-winfield/|Todd Bowles: Injuries Doomed Antoine Winfield|Last year Bucs safety Antoine Winfield was like the Tasmanian Devil in the Bucs’ secondary. He was everywhere. It’s why he was an All-Pro. Picking balls off, sacking quarterbacks, racing across the field to punch balls out at the goal line. Dude was a force. Since the first game when he stepped onto the field for the Bucs as a rookie, Winfield has had an impact on just about every game he has played. Except this year. Aside from a couple of plays early this season, Winfield was a shadow of his former self. Did you know he played last night? It’s true, he was on the field. Winfield played all 73 defensive snaps and had eight tackles. But Winfield really didn’t have a big-time play last like fans have grown accustomed to in his previous four seasons. Joe knows Winfield’s been dealing with foot and knee issues since Week 1. So Joe asked Bowles today, aside from the injuries, why he thought Winfield rarely made an impact this year. Bowles said, well, injuries. “Injuries [were] his issue,” Bowles said. “He missed four weeks to start out, when he came back, he wasn’t completely healthy, and then he got hurt again. A healthy Winfield leads to healthy plays.” So if Winfield was healthy would he have played at his All-Pro level? And if so, how many more games would the Bucs have won? Would the Bucs still be alive if Winfield was physically fresh last night? These are all unknowns. But Winfield not playing like Winfield is one reason the Bucs’ pass defense stunk.|2025-01-13 16:01:00|264|42|6|Antoine Winfield|Winfield's impact reduced due to injuries in disappointing season.|3|Mixed attitudes with criticism towards coaching and defensive performance.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""LVMYBUCS"", ""post"": ""Sure\u2026\u2026\u2026.the Chiefs and Detroit and ect ect have injuries come on dude a real head coach adjust and wins Todd u don\u2019t know how to do ether please get injured and leave the building."", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""13th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""4:08"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Pmike"", ""post"": ""Wow real classy\u2026 A+ fan base here in tampa"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""13th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""4:31"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""stpetebucsfan"", ""post"": ""Classy Comment LV your parents must be proud!"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""13th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""4:37"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter3"": {""username"": ""stpetebucsfan"", ""post"": ""PMike"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""13th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""4:38"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter4"": {""username"": ""Anthony"", ""post"": ""Offense stunk too"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""13th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""4:42"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter5"": {""username"": ""dbbuc711"", ""post"": ""Yeah, it had nothing to do with signing that big contract.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/tristan-wirfs-self-inflicted-mistakes-doomed-the-bucs/|Tristan Wirfs: Self-Inflicted Mistakes Doomed The Bucs|Today at One Buc Palace, Joe saw dudes carry out their belongings in trash bags. Rachaad White, for example had so much stuff he needed a wagon-like cart to haul his stuff. Some Bucs walked out of that locker room for the last time. Some like K.J. Britt, a free agent, have an uncertain future. He really has no idea what uniform he will wear when OTAs begin across the NFL in April. The Bucs are in that situation — and booking trips to the DR to escape the unusually gloomy, chilly Tampa Bay weather — because they puked on themselves last night. That’s the way Tristan Wirfs saw it after the game. He came right out and said the Bucs lassoed themselves with dumb mistakes. “We had some penalties, put us behind the sticks a couple times,” Wirfs said. “That’s hard to overcome in a tight ballgame like that. We knew it was going to be close. … We just have to be cleaner. “That’s what stings – we know we can be better, and that’s the hard part about it. We have a long time to think about this one and that’s going to suck, but the work continues.” Wirfs vowed the team will be better next year. But will it? Since the NFL created the NFC South in 2002, only one coach has ever won four division titles in a row. That was Sean Payton. Bucs coach Todd Bowles has three consecutive NFC titles. So just based on history, the odds of Bowles having a fourth-straight division title aren’t in his favor. And as many players have told Joe in the past 24 hours, this Bucs team will be different. By natural attrition — retirement, the draft and free agency — they could have a dozen or more different players on the 53-man roster come September. Will that team be able to all row as one? It’s anyone’s guess.|2025-01-13 15:37:00|322|33|3|Tristan Wirfs|Bucs face uncertain future after self-inflicted mistakes.|4|Mixed sentiments with some optimism about potential improvements alongside frustration and disappointment.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Keith"", ""post"": ""Keep us up to date Joe.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/what-a-waste/|What A Waste!|This makes Joe want to pound his head on the keyboard. It seems Baker Mayfield may have turned one of his best statistical games of his Bucs career last night. Or at least one of his best if you believe NextGen Stats. And for nothing! Here are the details by way of Grant Gordon of NFL.com, Mayfield was, well, quite successful throwing the ball. (Joe won’t mention the handoff issue between Jalen McMillan and Mayfield.) Baker Mayfield completed 15 of 18 passes for 185 yards and two touchdowns, recording his highest success rate in a game since joining the Buccaneers (65.2%). And it all got flushed down the toilet largely because of a fumble and largely because one of the league’s worst pass defenses was absolutely getting sliced and diced by a rookie quarterback who broke a 12-year drought for winless rookie quarterbacks on the road in the postseason. Oh, and Jayden Daniels became the first Washington rookie quarterback to win a playoff game since the great Sammy Baugh. (There is no truth to the rumor that back in the day, Ira and Baugh got into a fistfight over Muriel Berkowitz.)

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/lavonte-david-tells-todd-bowles-skeptics-they-shouldnt-complain/|Lavonte David Tells Todd Bowles Skeptics They Shouldn’t “Complain”|A hearty faction of Bucs fans doesn’t think Todd Bowles is a head coach that can lead the Bucs to the Super Bowl. They’re frustrated or angry, or just plain on the war path. Some have been that way for many weeks. Whatever. Bowles is coming back. Deal with it. Regardless, Joe mentioned the fan grumbling to Lavonte David today and asked him to address fans on the issue. He was happy to. “Outside looking in, [fans] see something different,” David began. “But inside, being in the building and seeing him every day the way he works, the way he tries to do the best for the players and stuff like that, we know what type of guy we got. We know what type of leader and a man he is. And if you don’t hear none of us complaining about him, I don’t think you should complain about him. So just know that he got our best interest and he’s a guy who wants to win, as well. And he’s just trying to put us in the best position to win football games. You know, sometimes this it didn’t do that, but you can tell that we we love him by the way we play for him.” So there you go. David says you should stop complaining, if you’re in that camp. Joe doesn’t tell fans how to be fans and, frankly, Joe can’t say with certaintly that Bowles is a guy that can lead a team to a Super Bowl. It’s an unknown, much like it is for 75 percent of NFL head coaches. Joe doesn’t consider uncertainty, however, to be a reason to fire a head coach. The Bucs had a winning season and major strides were made — and setbacks were realized. The overall culture is good. If Bowles can’t improve next season, then Joe will have a very different perspective.  |2025-01-13 14:22:00|315|62|6|Lavonte David|Lavonte David defends Todd Bowles against fan criticism.|2|Mixed feelings about Todd Bowles' coaching with criticisms and some support.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""FlBoy84"", ""post"": ""Rarely do we ever hear players complain about a HC, most toe the company line and give generic sound bites simply for business reasons."", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""13th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""2:28"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Couch Fan"", ""post"": ""Well there you have it.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/todd-bowles-wants-a-shaq-barrett-return/|Todd Bowles Wants A Shaq Barrett Return|With only five snaps for Bucs sacks king Shaq Barrett in the groin-stomp loss last night, it was clear that head coach/defensive coordinator Todd Bowles didn’t consider Shaq to be a savior of his defense.  Today, Joe asked Bowles if Shaq didn’t prove to be ready for his two-week return from retirement. “Well, he missed a whole season. You come back, two weeks aren’t going to get you ready,” Bowles said. “The scheme has changed some since he’s played and trying to put him in and do the things he could do in a very agressive call of the defense, so we’re bringing him along slowly and making sure he’s in shape. We didn’t want him to go out there and get hurt. But hopefully, he has a future for us next year.” Joe would welcome a Shaq return on a very inexpensive contract ($2 million plus incentives?). Shaq turns 33 in November. Joe has no expectation of Shaq recapturing his full glory, but he certainly could be an effective situational pass rusher. And Joe surely suspects Shaq is a better player than Markees Watts, José Ramirez and Joe Tryon-Shoyinka.|2025-01-13 13:58:00|190|32|3|Todd Bowles|Bowles cautious about Shaq Barrett return after retirement.|2|Overall negative sentiment towards coaching staff and several players, highlighting defensive shortcomings.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""K"", ""post"": ""No one cares what Bowles thinks, fire the moron."", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""13th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""2:03"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""firethecannons"", ""post"": ""JTS needs to be gone  he was awful"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""13th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""2:08"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""Gofortheface30"", ""post"": ""Situationally sure.

He was hopping off the field.  It didn’t look good. Today at One Buc Palace, Joe asked Todd Bowles for an update and the head coach offered nothing other than David was walking pretty well. David, however, had more specifics for Joe. The iconic Bucs linebacker said it was a knee and an ankle injury. “I’ll be fine. I just got rolled up on. Something, you know, usual football contact thing. Knowing my myself, I’m tough. I’ll tough it out,” David said. Joe sure hopes it’s a big nothing that will feel 100 percent after a couple weeks of rest and rehab. The Bucs need David to return and a lingering injury won’t help that cause. David said today he’s uncertain about his future and will take time with family and make a decision.|2025-01-13 13:32:00|159|19|5|Lavonte David|Knee and ankle injury uncertainty for iconic Bucs linebacker.|6|Mixed sentiments about Lavonte David's retirement and impact on the team's defense.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""NJbucs23"", ""post"": ""Thanks for everything #54.

Considering the Bucs will have flexibility in free agency this year, and could create more, the Bucs’ direction in late April is certainly unknown. The needs are clear, but prioritizing them now is difficult. But hey, that’s the fun of the offseason. Of course, so much of the Bucs’ course will be determined by Lavonte David’s decision on continuing his career. Left guard Ben Bredeson is sure to be a priority in free agency, but Joe is sure Buccaneers Ring of Honor general manager Jason Licht will have a cash line in the sand. And then there’s stud receiver Chris Godwin. He may not be able to work out full throttle for another two months at least. The Bucs certainly have a significant decision there.|2025-01-13 12:01:00|139|79|5|The Bucs|Uncertainty surrounding Bucs' draft pick and offseason decisions.|2|Many comments express pessimism and frustration with defensive needs and coaching.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""MelvinJunior"", ""post"": ""Trade-up for Jalon Walker, UGA."", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""13th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""12:03"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Mike Johnson"", ""post"": ""Give Cleveland our 1st pick.

And stop throwing social media feces at Joe. Todd Bowles will be the Bucs’ head coach next season. Joe said it and wrote it last week and nothing has changed. If you don’t like it, call Bucs headquarters or change your buying habits. Why has Joe been saying this? Because that’s what Joe’s been told, Ira Kaufman, too. Speaking on the team’s radio network last night, Buccaneers Ring of Honor general manager lauded the Bucs’ culture and operation. “It’s a good time to be a Buc,” Licht said. “We’re doing a lot of great things, the entire organization. A lot of stability has helped. Obviously, great players, great coaching. So it’s an exciting time.” Losing is painful. Watching a once proud and stingy defense get toyed with is painful. Joe’s in pain, too. But that agony isn’t tied to processing another Todd Bowles season. He’s back, and the Bucs are in position to improve significantly.|2025-01-13 08:34:00|173|188|9|Jason Licht|Jason Licht endorses stability and coaching at Bucs organization.|2|Mixed outlook with some hope for improvement but overall pessimism and disappointment.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Lt.

He is a HC 6 years now, 3 with us. He continues to make the same mistakes and he never learns. Calling timeouts when you must let the clock run and allowing opponents to have time in the last 2 minutes. Not calling timeouts and let the clock run when you need time. Not calling timeouts on defense and let the clock run to save time for the offense. We have seen it so many times. We saw it yesterday too. Yes we scored the TD in the end of the 1st half but the 13 seconds that we waste was a mistake nevertheless. You cant be a HC 6 years and so many years in the NFL and dont know how to use the clock and the timeouts. Its ririculous.

The baker fumble was the worst play of the game by far and the most harmful because it essentially gave them a td. The inability of the defense to stop a vanilla offense (college style run option) is completely comical and the fact they went for it on every 4th down showed they wanted it more. Now the refs did us no favor..I saw more holding then life insurance call center be the commanders. They held back on using the flags on them but sure found their use of throwing them on us.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/five-things-86/|Five Things|Ugly way to start the week. Well, let’s close the books on the 2024 season. Get your coffee and make it strong. Here we go. Fumble Turned The Game It seemed like the Bucs were in the driver’s seat leading 17-13 early in the fourth quarter. The Bucs had just forced Washington off the field on a failed fourth down at the Bucs-3. If the Bucs could somehow use their firepower to score a touchdown on this drive, that may just do it. Bucky Irving was warmed up. Marshon Lattimore was struggling with Mike Evans. Jalen McMillan started to punish the Commandos. Then disaster struck! Baker Mayfield had a botched handoff with McMillan on a jet sweep. Just looking at the NBC broadcast feed, it sure seemed there were no white jerseys on the left side where McMillan intended to run (Joe will have to watch all-22 to know). Of course, Washington recovered. Bobby Wagner pounced on the loose ball. Four plays later, Washington took a 20-17 lead on a Jayden Daniels touchdown pass to Terry McLaurin. The Bucs never saw the lead again. That fumble turned the game around. McMillan said in the locker room he and Mayfield just weren’t on the same page. Mayfield took the bullet and accepted all blame. It just goes to show how mistakes are magnified in the playoffs. The Bucs made plenty of mistakes that led to the loss. None bigger than that fumble. Fix The Defense, Please. It’s clear that either this defense needs a makeover, or Bucs coach Todd Bowles needs to bring in a defensive coordinator. A defensive-minded head coach can not be leading a team that has a flag football defense. Joe gets that there have been injuries. Antoine Winfield, who has been a shell of his former self, has been battling injuries since Week 1. Jordan Whitehead is in the same boat. Jamel Dean has become an injury waiting to happen. Aside from Lavonte David, the inside linebackers are not good, maybe they’re ok as spot starters for injuries. And the edge rush — don’t get Joe started (what edge rush?). First thing Bowles needs to do is find out what’s going on with Winfield. Getting him back on track should be a major priority. A new cornerback to add quality stability for when Dean gets injured — and he will get injured — would go a long way. If it takes a new defensive coordinator to do this (notice Joe didn’t type “a new head coach?”), then so be it. But a defense with a head coach who is a defensive guy should not be getting lit up in the passing game week after week by quarterbacks good and bad, young and old. The Bucs the past two seasons had the No. 28 passing defense allowing 248 and 243 passing yards a game, respectively. That’s two years now. Enough! That should be Bowles’ No. 1 order of business beginning, hell, beginning today: fix his defense. If that means new starters, new assistants, a new coordinator, get it done. It’s hit the point of irresponsibility that one side of the ball does quite well (offense) and the other side drags the team down weekly (defense). Todd Bowles Ain’t Going Anywhere Joe knows there were actually some Bucs fans who wanted the Commandos to pound the Bucs. Why would a Bucs fan want that? To see Bowles embarrassed enough that Team Glazer would fire him. It’s not happening, guys. Unless somehow Team Glazer finds something ugly in Bowles’ closet or Bowles is blatantly insubordinate to Team Glazer, he’s safe. Does Joe get frustrated with Bowles’ defenses at times? Yes. Does Joe get frustrated by Bowles’ usually conservative ways? Absolutely. But for a coach to win three straight division titles in his first three years, that’s rare. Just winning three straight divisions is not easy to pull off. And each season the Bucs’ record has improved. No, Joe doesn’t like quick exits in the playoffs. However, Team Glazer likes division titles (to a point) because that’s a significant chunk of revenue. Football is a business, after all. Did Team Glazer get tired of Father Dungy after many quick bounces from the playoffs? Sure, but not following direct (ahem) suggestions was also a factor. Same with Chucky. To the best of Joe’s knowledge, Bowles has not yet rebuffed a suggestion from Team Glazer. Bowles isn’t going anywhere unless he retires or has a sudden itch to watch his son’s games at Michigan. About a month ago, Bowles told Joe on the record the rumors of him retiring are a bag of fertilizer. Bowles will be your Bucs coach in 2025. Mike Evans Won The Battle But Lost The War So a lot of folks in the national media were salivating for the latest round of Mike Evans-Marshon Lattimore bouts. This time Evans won. But he lost. Meaning, the Bucs lost. The Bucs targeted Evans early on and he was guarded by Lattimore. Evans schooled him, including on a one-yard touchdown pass late in the first half to tie the game at 10. At times, Lattimore looked frustrated, maybe even taking some cheap shots at Evans. The future Pro Football Hall of Famer kept his cool and punched back with catches, not fists. Evans caught all seven of his targets for 92 yards, typical of the greatest offensive player in Bucs history. Solemn Bucs Locker Room The Bucs’ locker room is always sad after the final game (unless the Bucs win the Super Bowl). Guys will be saying goodbye to teammates, in some cases, for the final time. Joe will always remember last year at the locker room cleanout day (which always follows the final game), there was Pat O’Connor’s signed jersey with a thoughtful note hanging over the chair at Lavonte David’s locker. The two come from and live in two different worlds. One Chicago, the other Miami. Aside from a Bucs’ Super Bowl reunion, O’Connor and David might never meet again. That’s how the end is like in a locker room. Guys may never see their Bucs’ brothers in arms again. Joe saw four guys getting a lot of bro hugs from teammates last night: Lavonte David, J.J. Russell, Kyle Trask and Anthony Nelson. All are free agents in eight weeks. Grab the cash while you can. David may retire. Russell just wants a job. Trask probably wants a chance to play. Nelson is likely looking for a payday. Since he’s 27, his next contract might be his last. After the loss to the Crows in October, the Bucs’ locker room was far more dark. Last night, the locker room seemed to have more of a feeling of, “Well guys, this is it.” Depressing? That may be too strong. Sad? That’s a more apt description. Lastly (Bonus Item) With the end of the Bucs season, so too comes the end of another season of “Five Things” the morning after a game. These are often typed up in the wee hours of the morning. (Joe’s still banging on the keyboard and it’s close to 5 a.m.) Joe appreciates that this column often gets a fair amount of comments and sometimes a bunch of readers. The “Five Things” column will resume, as usual, with the next Bucs (regular season) game in roughly eight months. But man, it’s soon to get busy. The free agency dinner bell is less than two months from now. The combine is in six weeks. And there is always news here daily. So pleas check back early and often. Just because the season is over doesn’t mean Joe’s work is over. Hardly! The NFL never sleeps. And thank you for reading this column. Joe truly appreciates it.|2025-01-13 07:00:00|1289|109|3|Five Things|Bucs suffer playoff loss|1|Mixed sentiments towards the team's future and coaching staff.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Trask To The Future"", ""post"": ""Trask isn\u2019t going anywhere.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/todd-bowles-jamel-dean-injury-hurt-bucs-defense/|Todd Bowles: Jamel Dean Injury Hurt Bucs Defense|In a close game, losing a starter is bad. When that starter is a corner and the quarterback the Bucs are facing is red hot, losing that corner could be lethal. Now Joe is not saying the Bucs lost to the Commandos last night because Jamel Dean got hurt. But Todd Bowles said after the playoff game that Dean’s injury surely didn’t help. “It was huge from some of the things we try to do and wanted to do,” Bowles said. “Kind of did a good job getting the fourth down stop in the red zone. Then it came back on fourth down and they got the touchdown there. “[Josh] Hayes fought hard and he played and we been doing it all year, so there is no excuse there.” Joe thinks Dean is an OK corner, maybe a good corner. If you don’t like that he plays a soft zone, well, that’s on the coaches. Joe is very confident if Dean was blowing off Bowles and just being plain insubordinate and freelancing by playing a soft zone against Bowles’ wishes, then Bowles would have benched him by now. Joe’s issue with Dean is he can’t stay on the field. As Bill Parcells famously said, “Your best ability is your availability.” Dean, 28, missed five games this year. That’s nearly a third of the season. He played in the fewest number of regular season games of his career. Even as a rookie he played in 13 games. Last year Dean played in only 13 games, missing four and getting hurt against Detroit in the divisional round. Last night he got hurt in his second straight playoff game. Joe will get into Dean’s contract intel at a later date. There are two months (March 12) until the free agency dinner bell rings. But with Dean’s inability to stay on the field, the Bucs are going to have to look at adding a legit corner. Dean is brittle as it is. As Phil Simms once said, NFL players don’t get healthier as they get older. Joe’s not trying to kill Dean. He’s a good dude and no player this side of Myron Lewis wants to be hurt. However, the last two campaigns of injury-plagued seasons suggest the Bucs need a better backup plan or an upgrade.|2025-01-13 04:04:00|383|74|5|Todd Bowles|Dean injury affects Bucs defense|2|Strong sentiment against coaching staff, defense struggling, calls for change and criticism.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""MadMax"", ""post"": ""Emmanwori"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""13th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""4:17"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""ATrain"", ""post"": ""What hurt the Defense is Bowles"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""13th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""4:50"", ""am""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""MadMax"", ""post"": ""Had nothing to do with the overall bad calling of defensive plays the whole dm time todd. i dont want to dislike you, but you keep forcing me\u2026come on man"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""13th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""4:58"", ""am""]}, ""commenter3"": {""username"": ""HC Grover"", ""post"": ""Blah Blah Blah Fire Bowles hire a new HC and DC.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/ira-kaufmans-10-takeaways-from-bucs-commanders-2/|Ira Kaufman’s 10 Takeaways From Bucs-Commanders|BY IRA KAUFMAN Sometimes, you have to give the other guy some credit. The 2024 Buc season ended with a thud Sunday, a game-winning FG that clanked off the right upright as time expired. Tampa Bay fans will undoubtedly dwell on what the home team didn’t do, but the reality is the Commanders played a confident, poised game in prevailing 23-20. The Buc defense had its moments with a pair of goal-line stands in the second half, but there were no takeaways and Jayden Daniels kept converting third downs so often that Liam Coen’s group was limited to only 44 snaps. Heading into the Monday night matchup between the Vikings and Rams, Tampa Bay is the only home team that didn’t advance in the wild-card round. Rookie quarterbacks have traditionally wilted in the postseason, but Daniels stood tall, whether he was in the pocket or racing around end. “You can’t rattle this kid,” Washington executive Doug Williams told me as he walked to the team bus after the game. “He’s just different.” Daniels completed 24 passes, including seven to favorite target Terry McLaurin. Although Washington’s ground game went nowhere, the Commanders dominated time of possession. “How many times did we punt today?” bellowed Commanders offensive coordinator Kliff Kingsbury as he exchanged high-fives on the way to the locker room. The answer: a big fat ZERO. Despite solid games from Mike Evans and Bucky Irving, the Bucs were held below 24 points for only the fourth time this season. Baker Mayfield completed 15-of-18 passes and threw two short TD passes, but he also played a central role in the game’s only turnover — a muffed exchange with rookie wide receiver Jalen McMillen on a designed jet sweep. The Commanders move on to the Motor City while the Bucs have an offseason to think about what could have been. A young, talented roster and a 10-8 record suggests good times are ahead for Tampa Bay football fans. The heartbreak cut deep in the Buc locker room as Cade Otton lamented that the 2025 Bucs will look different. Yes they will. Improving this defense will be the obvious offseason priority and we shall soon find out whether Liam Coen will return to orchestrate a potent attack. The Todd Bowles skeptics, and there are more than a handful, will use this setback as another example of poor clock management and spotty defense. The bitter truth is the Bucs were outplayed. The margin of victory was small, but it was evident nevertheless. Give the visitors their due. The Commanders opened the season with a loss in Tampa as Mayfield threw four TD passes. Four months later, Washington’s success on third down (8-of-15) kept Mayfield and company on ice. The Bucs were a good team for most of the season, but they weren’t a complete team. They finished with only seven interceptions in 18 games. That’s not nearly good enough — and Bowles knows it. Here’s how the Commanders stayed alive, improving to 13-5 behind Daniels, soon to be the runaway Offensive Rookie of the Year: * If this was Lavonte David’s final NFL game, he went out balling. David posted eight tackles and Tampa Bay’s only sack. He will take some time to decide whether to make the commitment toward a 14th season. One thing’s for sure — if he plays, it will be in a Buc uniform. * Missed tackles were a problem once again as Washington receivers consistently spun away for added yardage. It’s been an issue most of the season and it contributed to an untimely exit. * We tend to take Chase McLaughlin for granted, and that’s an oversight. He converted from 50 yards out on Sunday evening and on those rare occasions when McLaughlin misses a kick, Buc Nation is shocked. * Evans shook off his past struggles against Marshon Lattimore and had a heck of a game. * Mayfield helped Evans set the tone on the very first snap, rolling right and hitting No. 13 for 11 yards with Lattimore in coverage. With the Bucs nursing a 17-13 lead, Evans made a terrific play early in the fourth quarter, stretching his arm out for an 8-yard gain on third-and-7. That momentum disappeared on the very next snap as Mayfield fumbled at his own 13-yard line. * Tampa Bay’s rush defense, outstanding all season, was particularly stellar against the Commanders, who averaged 2.5 yards on their 33 carries. For the most part, Daniels was contained on the ground, with a long gain of only eight yards on his 13 runs. * The Bucs limited McLaurin to two catches for 17 yards in the season opener, but he hurt Tampa Bay repeatedly in the rematch. Besides a 35-yard reception, it was McLaurin who got open deep in the end zone on fourth-and-2 from the 5-yard line to put Washington ahead 20-17. * McLaughlin’s 32-yard FG tied the score with 4:41 remaining, but the Bucs had every opportunity to do more on a drive that featured a 26-yard strike to McMillan and Otton’s 20-yard catch-and-run. Tampa Bay had a second-and-1 from the 12-yard line before Mayfield was stuffed for no gain and Irving was dropped for a 2-yard loss. That proved to be a killer sequence. * The Bucs talked all week about containing Daniels. Then he flashed the skills that portend lots of good times are ahead for long-suffering Washington fans. “Incredible football player, man,” David said. “They have a great football player over there.” * Mayfield registered a 146.5 passer rating in the season finale. He would undoubtedly trade that in for an opportunity to extend Tampa Bay’s season. He finished with 43 TD passes in 18 games, rewarding management’s investment with the best season of his career. Imagine what he would have done if Chris Godwin hadn’t dislocated his ankle in Week 7? * Otton is on point about this roster churning over. No team stays the same, but most of the core pieces will be back and the Bucs should be favored to win the NFC South for the fifth consecutive season. Jason Licht may be one more stellar draft class away from making this a very dangerous team in the fall. |2025-01-13 01:21:00|1034|49|4|Bucs-Commanders|Bucs playoff loss analyzed with some optimism for future.|2|Mixed sentiments ranging from disappointment, criticism of Bowles, calls for changes in defense, and praise for Licht.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Joseph C Simmons"", ""post"": ""Jason will probably have another excellent draft, but we\u2019re in our championship window now, so it\u2019s time to sign a few free agents that can contribute effectively and immediately: "", ""post_time"": [""Joseph"", ""C"", ""Simmons""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""firethecannons"", ""post"": ""Jason Licht needs to buy us an edge rush x 2 and draft secondary and linebacker.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/stock-dropping-on-liam-coen/|Stock Dropping On Liam Coen?|Joe hopes and prays and hopes some more that offensive coordinator Liam Coen returns next season. However, Coen wants to be a head coach one day and the Jaguars plan to interview him for the head coaching gig week. Maybe Coen will pass on the interview. Maybe he won’t. But perhaps the only shred of good news that came out of the Bucs’ miserable loss to the Commanders last night is that Coen might have cost himself more interviews. Coen doesn’t block or fumble, but the bottom line is his offense didn’t meet its usual high standard on a national stage. And Joe thinks it’s fair to say no NFL owner watched last night’s game and said, “Dammit, I gotta have Coen.” Last night on Football Night in America, NBC insider Mike Florio talked about how Baker Mayfield told him how hungry he is to have Coen return. And Florio speculated that Coen could get more than just a Jacksonville interview with a strong showing against the Commanders. That didn’t happen. The Bucs were driving for the winning score and were stymied on 2nd-and-1 in the red zone, and then 3rd-and-1 turned into 4th-and-3. Todd Bowles kicked a field goal and Coen and the offense didn’t get the ball back. That was the final taste Coen left in mouths of NFL owners looking for a head coach. Joe’s not rooting against Coen personally, but Joe’s allegiance is to the Bucs. They need Coen back, and last night might have helped make that happen.|2025-01-13 01:10:00|253|44|4|Liam Coen|Uncertain future as potential head coach after recent disappointments.|2|Mixed sentiments on Coen's performance with frustrations over game decisions and lack of support.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""BucsBeast"", ""post"": ""Coen is gone if he gets the opportunity.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/365586/|Baker Mayfield Takes Full Blame For Botched Handoff|It looked like the game had turned. The Bucs led 17-13 early in the fourth quarter. Washington was driving but the Bucs defense stiffened (no, really!). Washington should have attempted a field goal but backward-cap-wearing fraternity pledge Dan Quinn decided he wanted to be one of the cool kids who host podcasts and believe that when ESPN analytics say to go for it, it becomes easier to pick up chicks than getting them drunk doing keg stands. The Bucs forced the Commandos off the field, denying them a first down on the Bucs-3. If the Bucs found a way to kill some clock and maybe march down the field and score a touchdown, that could be the game. Bucs offensive coordinator Liam Coen decided to call a jet sweep. From the NBC replays, there was hardly a white jersey on the left side of the field where Jalen McMillan was supposed to run the ball. He didn’t get a chance. The handoff was botched and the Commandos recovered. Four plays later, Jayden Daniels hit Terry McLaurin over the middle for a touchdown and a 20-17 lead. Washington never trailed after that. McMillan said in the Bucs’ locker room that he and Mayfield weren’t on the same page. Mayfield took full blame. “It comes back to me, just timing it up correctly,” Mayfield said. “First one of the year that happened so obviously the timing of it, not great.” It was awful timing. The way the Bucs defense couldn’t get off the field, the Commandos just drained the clock most of the rest of the game. Mistakes are bad. Mistakes in playoff games are worse. Mistakes inside your own 15 in the fourth quarter of a playoff game are often lethal. And that’s what happened tonight.|2025-01-13 01:09:00|295|41|3|Baker Mayfield|Mayfield takes full blame for botched handoff in playoff game.|5|Mixed opinions on Baker's performance and leadership.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/ferocious-finish-by-mike-evans/|Ferocious Finish By Mike Evans|The Buccaneers’ gameplan in last night’s crushing playoff loss was not to pump the football into Mike Evans early and often. Perhaps it should have been.  Joe’s a big fan of using a healthy Hall of Famer in his prime. Evans had seven targets and caught all of them — 7 catches for 92 yards and a touchdown, and he drew a flag. That’s just not enough targets for a receiver who overmatched cornerback Marshon Lattimore all game. Everything was on the line, and Joe would have liked to see more Evans. The Bucs didn’t throw Evans the ball on their final drive, which ended in a short field goal to tie the game at 20. Regardless, Joe is so encouraged to see Evans finish this season strong. What a final stretch he had for a 31-year-old with 11 years of NFL mileage on his legs. Evans doesn’t look like a guy slowing down, and that bodes very well for the Bucs next season. He’s irreplaceable, and it looks like the Bucs will get another season of No. 13’s best.|2025-01-13 00:51:00|180|21|7|Mike Evans|Strong finish by Evans in playoff loss|3|Mixed sentiments on players, coaches, and future team prospects.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/todd-bowles-offense-played-too-dumb/|Todd Bowles: Offense Played Too Dumb|In a playoff game, in a one-score situation, the smallest of mistakes blow up into game-changing nut-kicks. That’s what happened to the Bucs last night. Bucs coach Todd Bowles said (in not so many words) the offense played with its head up its rear end too often. Penalties on first downs. Snapping the ball on the wrong count near the goal line. Botched handoff on a jet sweep late. They all contributed to the Bucs being unable to put the game away against the Commandos when they had the chance. “We were shooting ourselves in the foot on first down with a lot of penalties in the first half, whether it was holding or offsides, whatever the case may be,” Bowles said. “Wasn’t giving ourselves a chance. “We feel like we never got in a good rhythm.” That’s what Bucs tight end Cade Otton thought. He told Joe after the game the Bucs didn’t have the ball enough to get into a flow, specifically the run game. The Commandos held a 35:26-24:34 time of possession advantage.|2025-01-13 00:40:00|176|77|5|Todd Bowles|Bucs' mistakes hinder offense in playoff game.|2|Comments are heavily critical of Todd Bowles and the defense, blaming them for the loss.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""AJ"", ""post"": ""L O L"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""13th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""12:42"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""TheBucsAnthem"", ""post"": ""Liam Coen got his azz kicked to sheit by Cliff Kingsburry"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""13th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""12:43"", ""am""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""AJ"", ""post"": ""smokes and mirrors"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""13th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""12:43"", ""am""]}, ""commenter3"": {""username"": ""Trevor"", ""post"": ""Offensive struggles for sure, but when the defense can\u2019t force a punt, allowing something like 4 out 5 4th down attempts, there\u2019s plenty of blame on that side of the ball as well, and I\u2019d even say more so."", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""13th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""12:43"", ""am""]}, ""commenter4"": {""username"": ""AJ"", ""post"": ""Defense didnt make them punt once. mic drop"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""13th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""12:43"", ""am""]}, ""commenter5"": {""username"": ""AJ"", ""post"": ""I smell \u201che tryna save his job for dear life\u201d LMAO"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""13th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""12:44"", ""am""]}, ""commenter6"": {""username"": ""BucsBeast"", ""post"": ""Can\u2019t get in a rhythm when your offense is riding pine for 75% of the game because the damn Defense can\u2019t make a stop."", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""13th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""12:45"", ""am""]}, ""commenter7"": {""username"": ""Bosch"", ""post"": ""Bowles doesn\u2019t want to lose his job to Liam.

The scene in the Bucs’ locker room after last night’s season-ending loss to the Commandos wasn’t quite the shell-shocked locker room after losing to the Crows earlier this year. But it was sullen. Joe noticed Bucs tight end Cade Otton going to almost every locker to bro-hug the players who hadn’t run away before the local pen and mic club left. Some players, like Lavonte David and Vita Vea, sad at their lockers in deep thought. Vea just stared into the middle of the locker room with an empty gaze. David was bent over and several players slapped him on the back and squeezed his shoulder. Otton saw David sitting there with his shoulder pads still on. Otton helped David take the shoulder pads off, almost like David didn’t want to take them off. Anthony Nelson, J.J. Russell and Kyle Trask were doing a lot of embracing with teammates. All three are free agents in two months. Otton admitted the finality of the season hit hard. He raved about the cohesive nature of the Bucs and that several may have walked out of the locker room for the very final time.|2025-01-13 00:29:00|199|26|5|Bucs|Somber scene after season-ending loss in Bucs' locker room.|1|Mixed sentiments ranging from frustration to hope and resignation about the team's performance.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Ufcguy32"", ""post"": ""They lost it.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/about-todd-bowles-fourth-quarter-field-goal-decision/|About Todd Bowles’ Fourth-Quarter Field Goal Decision|So the Bucs trailed 20-17 with 4:41 remaining at the Washington 14 yard line tonight. It was 4th-and-3. The Bucs had just failed on a quarterback sneak on second down, and Bucky Irving lost two yards on 3rd-and-1. So Todd Bowles brought out the field goal unit, which tied the game at 20. The Bucs never got the ball back. Should Bowles have gone for the first down? Should he have had a laser focus on taking a lead there and putting the ball in the hands of his best players, rather than his shaky defense? The Bucs had just struggled on the prior two downs. So Joe thinks the decision was a coin flip. Joe also keeps in mind that twice prior to that Commanders head coach Dan Quinn passed up short field goals in the red zone and failed on fourth down. When Joe says “coin flip,” that means Joe would have been good with either decision. Joe would love to hear what Bucs fans think, and not just the ones blowing up Joe’s cell phone.|2025-01-13 00:25:00|178|74|8|Todd Bowles|Bucs' field goal decision in critical moment.|1|Mixed sentiments leaning towards pessimism and dissatisfaction.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Josh"", ""post"": ""Fire Bowles!!"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""13th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""12:27"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Simeon4HOF"", ""post"": ""Fire our DC"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""13th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""12:29"", ""am""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""Anthony"", ""post"": ""Why they in a position to kick field goals anyway???

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/defense-couldnt-get-off-the-field/|Defense Couldn’t Get Off The Field|The defense wasn’t awful tonight. It wasn’t good but it wasn’t vintage Mike Smith, either. There was one big problem, Bucs corner Zyon McCollum told Joe after the game. “We couldn’t get off the field,” he said. That was it in a nutshell. Washington quarterback Jayden Daniels was really good, carving up the Bucs’ zone defense early. In the first two Commandos possessions, per NextGen Stats, Daniels was perfect throwing the ball against the Bucs weak-arse zone. And because the defense couldn’t get off the field, the Commandos were playing keepaway. The high-powered Tampa Bay offense couldn’t do a damn thing standing on the sideline watching the game. That’s why the screwed up handoff between Baker Mayfield and Jalen McMillan was so critical. It appeared the Bucs were about to take over the game when that took place. One major thing the Bucs must address is why the team was so soft on defense too often.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/theres-a-lot-to-think-about/|“There’s A Lot To Think About”|No announcement about the 2025 season from legendary linebacker Lavonte David in the shell-shocked Buccaneers locker room tonight. The Bucs want David back — he turns 35 this month — but David isn’t clear on his future. “There’s a lot to think about,” he said. No. 1 on David’s consideration list might be whatever caused him to hobble off the field with seconds remaining in the fourth quarter. Joe hopes it wasn’t serious, but David obviously couldn’t handle weight on one leg. With Todd Bowles returning next season, the Bucs certainly need David back. He can still play fast within this defense (video below), and he had a strong season overall. Joe’s keeping a positive attitude and will assume David wants to play his 14th NFL season in Tampa. The alternative is too painful to think about.|2025-01-13 00:03:00|137|27|7|Lavonte David|Uncertain future for veteran linebacker with strong season.|7|Mixed sentiment with appreciation for Lavonte, criticism of Bowles, and disappointment in team performance.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Jvato24"", ""post"": ""Legendary Lavonte!!!!!!!"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""13th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""12:04"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""BucfaninMi"", ""post"": ""He will be missed, one of a few that played their guts out!"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""13th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""12:04"", ""am""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""Bubby"", ""post"": ""LVD was hurt bad at the end of the game.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/running-blues/|Running Blues|For Joe, it was this simple: The loss to the Commandos in the wild card round to bring the 2024 season to an abrupt end Sunday night came down to running the ball. Or not running the ball. This was supposed to be the mismatch in the Bucs’ favor. The Bucs had the No. 4 run offense in the league. Washington’s run defense was lousy. The Commandos looked anything but lousy defending the run tonight. Cade Otton told Joe after the game the fact the Bucs being grossly outgunned in time of possession hurt. They didn’t have the ball enough to get rolling on the ground. The Commandos controlled the ball for 35 minutes and 26 seconds. The Bucs? Try 24:34. Bucky Irving, the rookie rushing sensation who blew up the league, had a pedestrian evening. He only ran the ball for 77 yards, averaging 4.5 yards a carry. The only other time Bucky had a worse yards-per-carry since the bye was 4.3 yards per carry in the loss to the Cowboys. The rest of the Bucs’ running backs? How about a grand total of one friggin’ yard. Uno. Ein. That was the difference. The Commandos found a run defense.
