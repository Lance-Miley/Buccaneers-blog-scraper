https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/what-to-do-with-jordan-whitehead/|What To Do With Jordan Whitehead?|At times last year, Bucs safety Jordan Whitehead played solid ball. However, that was not the norm. And “this Joe” noticed a few too many loafs for his liking. That was when Whitehead was on the field. To his credit, after he blew out a pec against the Giants, most players would have gone on injured reserve. Instead, Whitehead gutted it out and returned. Joe was impressed. Joe has maintained that Whitehead, who the Bucs were eager and excited to get back last year, was not the Whitehead they thought they re-signed. Joe expected Whitehead to be more like the player he was in 2020 when the Bucs won the Super Bowl. Instead, he looked more like a player that a bad team (the Jets) gave up on. Yes, Joe thinks the Bucs have buyer’s remorse. Of all the Bucs ESPN’s Jeremy Fowler thinks could be vulnerable to being a cap casualty, Fowler only mentioned Whitehead. In typing a story on rosters of teams that could contend for a Super Bowl next season, Fowler — who has his ear to the ground as well as any NFL stenographer — only mentioned Whitehead as a possible cap casualty. Tampa Bay can save $4.5 million against the cap by releasing safety Jordan Whitehead. Did Whitehead just need a year to get back in the groove with the Bucs and Todd Bowles’ defense? If Whitehead goes, who takes his place? Tykee Smith? Christian Izien? Or, with Whitehead is it “I will tolerate you until I can replace you,” as former Bucs coach Raheem Morris used to say. It’s not like Whitehead is breaking the bank. But if the Bucs need extra Team Glazer loot to get Myles Garrett, Trey Hendrickson or Maxx Crosby, well, then either Whitehead takes a pay cut or bye-bye Whitehead.|2025-02-15 11:00:00|301|39|3|Jordan Whitehead|Mixed sentiments on Jordan Whitehead's performance and potential release.|4|Mixed opinions on Whitehead's performance and future, some advocating for release or replacement.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Redzone"", ""post"": ""Cut him (maybe an injury settlement?) \u2013 subpar play and now he has a neck injury \u2013 that\u2019s bad mojo for a safety who used to be physical"", ""post_time"": [""Redzone""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Pmike"", ""post"": ""Wasnt there talk of Tykee moving from Nickel to safety?

It’s Over”|The Bucs will be hunting for a new backup center. Tampa Bay fans won’t have Robert Hainsey to pick on any longer. That was the word from All-Pro left tackle Tristan Wirfs, who says Hainsey is his best friend. “He’s going to go play somewhere. There’s not 31 centers in the league better than him. We talked about it all year. ‘He’s like. I’m going to leave. I’m not going to be here next year,’ Wirfs said of Hainsey on the The Pivot podcast. Wirfs mentioned how Hainsey struggled mentally after the Bucs drafted center Graham Barton to replace him but was an ultimate teammate who worked steadily to help Barton. Joe remembers Hainsey getting one start last season and absolutely dominating at New Orleans. It’ll be interesting to see what Hainsey’s market is in free agency. Wirfs may be overvaluing his buddy, so Joe isn’t ruling out a return of the Bucs’ 2021 third-round pick. The Pivot co-host Ryan Clark asked Wirfs about his embrace and loving words for Hainsey caught on camera after the Bucs lost to Washington in the playoffs. “It was kind of the realization that he’s leaving. It’s over,” Wirfs said.|2025-02-15 06:48:00|196|75|6|Robert Hainsey|Hainsey leaving Buccaneers|4|Mixed reactions for Robert Hainsey's departure, some supportive and appreciative, others critical and dismissive.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Beeej"", ""post"": ""He\u2019s right, I\u2019m sure there\u2019s at least a half dozen teams happy to have him for a starter"", ""post_time"": [""February"", ""15th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""7:00"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Redzone"", ""post"": ""Hainsey looked fine en route to 50 vs NO and Barton could have started at LG last season (remember the Licht/Spytek gap in messaging?)

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/mina-kimes-anything-to-help-the-pass-defense/|Mina Kimes: Anything To Help The Pass Defense|Mina Kimes made it clear on her podcast recently: There’s a lot to like about the Bucs. But the ESPN NFL analyst scrunched up her face like she just opened the door to an uncleaned arena restroom the morning after a Rob Zombie concert when talking about the one thing she doesn’t like about the Bucs. Her facial expression when she mentioned “pass defense” in breaking down the Bucs said it all. Kimes said signing or drafting any playmaker at edge rusher or elsewhere would be a smart move by Bucs AC/DC-loving general manager Jason Licht. “It’s not just one position,” Kimes said. “Edge, linebacker, corner, it’s just, you could address any of those. “It’s funny, because I think they’ve really drafted and signed well, this team did. Jason Licht’s a really good GM. But defensively, they haven’t had a ton of success. “I do like Calijah Kancey. And I think YaYa Diaby flashed. But they still really, really have a lot of holes on that defense right now.” Some defensive struggles are bad luck. A chunk of the blame, Joe believes, is because Todd Bowles is still looking to develop his first star edge rusher despite being a coordinator and/or head coach the past 11 seasons (though Joe is far from throwing in the towel on YaYa Diaby and it’s way unfair to judge Chris Braswell after only his rookie season). The Bucs have had bad luck elsewhere on defense. Where would the Bucs’ defense be if Devin White hadn’t fizzled out? Four years ago, White’s three-game stretch in the playoffs — at New Orleans, at Green Bay and in the Super Bowl — was so dominant and maybe only was topped by Lawrence Taylor. (Joe already spelled out that White had a better three-game playoff run than Ray Lewis ever did.) Who knew at the moment White rode his horse around The Licht House hoisting the Vince Lombardi Trophy in the air that he had already peaked and would rapidly circle the drain? He joins the list of defensive guys the Bucs drafted and expected to be game-changing dawgs, but for one reason or another fell on their faces. It would sure help if the Bucs drafted a game-changer two months from now.|2025-02-15 05:30:00|375|37|5|Mina Kimes|Concerns about Bucs pass defense and need for improvements.|5|Mixed sentiments about Todd Bowles' effectiveness in developing edge rushers and defense.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Defense Rules"", ""post"": ""You keep making the point Joe that Todd Bowles has never developed an edge rusher but no Bucs coach has ever developed an edge rusher.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/potentially-dire-inside-linebackers-unit/|Potentially Dire Inside Linebackers Unit|Yes, Joe knows there is no bigger need for the Bucs (if they are serious about making a Super Bowl run) than edge rusher. Sadly, that’s just one (albeit critical) position. The Bucs may have to address an entire position group on defense. If Bucs icon Lavonte David retires, money that could be allotted to an edge rusher might instead have to be funneled to inside linebacker. Because if David retires, the Bucs will have no starters at the position. K.J. Britt, who has the heart of a lion, is also a free agent. Too bad the Bucs cannot transfer his heart into an speedy Adonis of a body. He’s just not cut out to be a starting NFL inside linebacker. And no, as much as Joe likes SirVocea Dennis and is impressed with his play when he’s on the field, that’s exactly why Joe doesn’t trust him. He cannot stay healthy. Until he proves he can be on the field for 13+ games, the Bucs have to look elsewhere. Luring an experienced inside linebacker could be expensive. Sure, if David retires some (most?) if his $8,500,000 salary could go to another starting linebacker. But that would be just one. Walter Cherepinsky, the man behind WalterFootball.com, believes the Bucs’ edge rush is downright sorry and their inside linebacker need is dire. He believes the Bucs would be smart to sign/draft two starters at inside linebacker. Two linebackers: The Buccaneers couldn’t cover the middle of the field last year. They’ll have nothing at linebacker if Lavonte David leaves via free agency. A linebacker will still be needed if David re-signs. A second linebacker could be used as a rotational guy and/or groomed to replace David? Cherepinsky isn’t wrong. There’s no way a team can win with crap inside linebackers. So some Team Glazer loot that would otherwise be used to bring in a guy who can consistently breathe on a quarterback may have to go to inside linebackers. Thus, the Bucs may be stuck looking for a has-been or never-been to rush the passer. In other words, a waste of time, effort and Team Glazer loot.|2025-02-15 00:00:00|355|30|3|Inside Linebackers Unit|Urgent need for inside linebackers|2|Mixed feelings about LB corps, potential departures, and defensive needs but appreciation for content.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Aqualung"", ""post"": ""\u2026and then factor in, LVD is the only one of the LB corps who actually knows what everyone is supposed to do and even then they bust.
