https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/11/mike-evans-trending-to-play-against-giants/|Mike Evans “Trending” To Play Against Giants|So the greatest receiver in Bucs history was back on the practice field today with his healed/healing hamstring. Head coach Todd Bowles said Mike Evans is “trending” to play Sunday against the Giants. Joe sure hopes the vagueness from Bowles was just to throw off the folks in New Jersey. Is Evans ready or not? Surprisingly to Joe, the Bucs were not in pads today, even though that option was available to Todd Bowles. Coming off a bye week, one in which Bowles gave his players six consecutive days off (it could have been as little as four, per league rules), Joe thought the Bucs would have an intense and physical practice. It seems that wasn’t the case. Joe will now resume praying that Evans truly is healthy when/if he returns to the field.|2024-11-20 18:56|134|21|6|Mike Evans|Evans likely to play; uncertainty surrounding his health and practice.|1|Mixed sentiments ranging from concern over injuries to optimism about player performance.|"""\""{\\\""commenter0\\\"": {\\\""username\\\"": \\\""Nicholas Carlson\\\"", \\\""post\\\"": \\\""What about Zyon?\\\"", \\\""post_time\\\"": [\\\""November\\\"", \\\""20th,\\\"", \\\""2024\\\"", \\\""at\\\"", \\\""2:05\\\"", \\\""pm\\\""]}, \\\""commenter1\\\"": {\\\""username\\\"": \\\""Oxycondomns\\\"", \\\""post\\\"": \\\""lets reinjure mikes hamstring again\\\"", \\\""post_time\\\"": [\\\""November\\\"", \\\""20th,\\\"", \\\""2024\\\"", \\\""at\\\"", \\\""2:14\\\"", \\\""pm\\\""]}, \\\""commenter2\\\"": {\\\""username\\\"": \\\""PSL Bob\\\"", \\\""post\\\"": \\\""I would not play Evans until we play the Chargers.\\\"", \\\""post_time\\\"": [\\\""November\\\"", \\\""20th,\\\"", \\\""2024\\\"", \\\""at\\\"", \\\""2:22\\\"", \\\""pm\\\""]}, \\\""commenter3\\\"": {\\\""username\\\"": \\\""BallHawk75\\\"", \\\""post\\\"": \\\""Mike\\\\u2019s open!!!!\\\"", \\\""post_time\\\"": [\\\""November\\\"", \\\""20th,\\\"", \\\""2024\\\"", \\\""at\\\"", \\\""2:51\\\"", \\\""pm\\\""]}, \\\""commenter4\\\"": {\\\""username\\\"": \\\""Beeej\\\"", \\\""post\\\"": \\\""I\\\\u2019m more worried about his thousand yards than this injury-riddled team advancing in the playoffs\\\"", \\\""post_time\\\"": [\\\""November\\\"", \\\""20th,\\\"", \\\""2024\\\"", \\\""at\\\"", \\\""3:12\\\"", \\\""pm\\\""]}, \\\""commenter5\\\"": {\\\""username\\\"": \\\""Panhandle Buc\\\"", \\\""post\\\"": \\\""Given Todd\\\\u2019s record coming out of a bye week, I don\\\\u2019t trust his preparation judgement\\\\u2026\\\"", \\\""post_time\\\"": [\\\""November\\\"", \\\""20th,\\\"", \\\""2024\\\"", \\\""at\\\"", \\\""3:27\\\"", \\\""pm\\\""]}, \\\""commenter6\\\"": {\\\""username\\\"": \\\""Kenton Smith\\\"", \\\""post\\\"": \\\""Expecting Mike to go for 100 yards and a touchdown Sunday.

Johnson was a guest of multimedia icon Rock Riley on WDAE radio and was asked about calls to replace head coach Todd Bowles with offensive coordinator Liam Coen. That drew a laugh from Johnson. “It’s probably a little too early right now (laughs) to be making those decisions,” he said. “I mean, honestly, the Buccaneers, I think they’ve had the hardest schedule in the NFL. Johnson rattled off the Bucs’ tough losses and big wins against the Lions, Eagles and Commandoes. Still, Johnson didn’t take a coaching change off the table. He just wants to see more. “Players are going to come and go and coaches are going to come and go, but obviously you want a quarterback to be in the same system for a long period of time — over time,” Johnson said. “They’ll figure that out, but I wouldn’t make those decisions now. There’s been a lot of great success with Todd Bowles as the head coach. … They got a chance. Honestly, they got a chance. They’ve got seven games left and they’re playing against five quarterbacks in the next weeks on teams that have struggled. … I wouldn’t give up on this team and make coaching changes right now in the middle of the season with seven games to go. We’ve got time here.” Joe hasn’t thrown in the towel on Bowles. There are no crowns handed out in November, but Joe does know Bowles needs wins to deserve a Year 4. That starts Sunday with the tanking Giants, and then continues the following week with the sad Panthers and then home in Tampa for a whimpering two-win Las Vegas team.|2024-11-20 15:53|310|37|5|Brad Johnson|Interview discussing Tampa Bay Buccaneers coaching situation.|0|"Pessimistic sentiments about Todd Bowles' coaching abilities and the team's performance.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/11/was-the-bucs-giants-outcome-revealed-at-a-news-conference/|Was The Bucs-Giants Outcome Revealed At A News Conference?|So iconic Giants running back Tiki Barber, twin brother of Bucs legend Rondé Barber, will be calling the Bucs-Giants game this Sunday for CBS. That’s got Joe’s antennae up for nuggets Tiki might drop during his WFAN New York radio show this week. Joe has no doubt that the Barber brothers will be talking plenty behind the scenes. Of course, all the chatter in New York is about the Giants (2-8) just benching franchise quarterback Daniel Jones in favor of third-stringer, fan-favorite Tommy DeVito. But it’s equally about the Giants needing to tank for draft position. Tiki Barber said Monday that he would be studying Tuesday’s news conference of Giants head coach Brian Daboll to see if the Giants are sincere about having DeVito be successful. “It’s the next media availability that I’m very interested in,” Barbers said before Tuesday’s news conference. “Like I’m really interested to see what the reaction is. Because if it’s like ‘eh, whatever,’ I don’t know if Tommy’s going to be successful. If it’s like they love Tommy, he’s been grinding here as the scout team quarterback. We love what he brings and we’re excited for him and we’re going to rally around them,’ then he has a chance. Not to be the starting quarterback in 2025 [and] beyond, but just to be successful.” Well, Joe heard that take from Tiki Barber on Monday and listened to the Daboll news conference yesterday. There was no excitement from the head coach raving about how DeVito has been killing it on the scout team, or barking that DeVito is a winner that will energize the team. Assuming Tiki has the pulse of the team, Joe’s conclusion was the Giants are not doing their best to win games. And that jibes with stud Giants nose tackle Dexter Lawrence going public with his dislike of the QB change. The Bucs simply cannot lose Sunday’s game.|2024-11-20 15:15|316|25|5|Bucs-Giants|Tiki Barber analyzes Giants' QB situation and possible tanking strategy.|"sentiment score:

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/11/the-bucs-takeaways-and-winning-football-games/|The Bucs, Takeaways And Winning Football Games|Joe was very, very surprised no one with the Bucs had whined about this stat this year. Lousy Lovie Smith would have been bellyaching about this for weeks. We all know how defensive coaches just love takeaways. The way some of these defensive guys go on and on about takeaways, Joe swears they believe they’re more important than points. So Joe looked up how the Bucs are doing on takeaways. Bet you’ll be surprised. Even with Baker Mayfield doing a solid job taking care of the football, the Bucs have just as many takeaways as they have offensive turnovers. The defense has taken the ball away from opponents 12 times through 10 games. The offense has coughed the ball up 12 times. So the takeaway differential for the Bucs is dead-even, a big ol’ zero. How does that rank? That puts the Bucs at No. 10 in the NFL. Who has the third-best takeaway differential? Da Bears, who very likely will can their coach in a few weeks. (Joe has friends in Chicago and touched base with a few about dead man walking Matt Eberflus. Chicago is on fire wanting his head on a platter after the latest debacle Sunday against the Packers.) Who has the fifth-worst in takeaway differential? It’s the 9-1 defending Super Bowl champion Chiefs. As Joe has preached for years, football is not about turnovers. It’s about playing fundamentally sound — blocking, tackling and most importantly, which cannot be stressed enough, scoring touchdowns.|2024-11-20 14:00|247|14|2|The Bucs|Defensive and offensive turnovers compared in NFL standings.|3|Mixed sentiment towards Bucs' defensive coordinator Bowles with varying levels of frustration and hope.|"""\""{\\\""commenter0\\\"": {\\\""username\\\"": \\\""BA\\\\u2019s Red Pen\\\"", \\\""post\\\"": \\\""The biggest takeaway that would help the Bucs win games is if they takeaway Bowles\\\\u2019 job!

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/11/whats-gone-wrong-for-liam-coen/|What’s Gone Wrong For Liam Coen?|If you are going to find something wrong with the Bucs’ hire of offensive coordinator Liam Coen and the job he has done, you may have to set aside some time to discover a fault. Coen has done an outstanding job. Quarterback Baker Mayfield has improved upon a career year in 2023. The revamped offensive line is solid if not strong and seemingly improving by the week. The Bucs rank No. 3 in explosive plays. What’s there to quibble about? In an ESPN feature focused on the performance of offensive coordinators this year, reporter Jenna Laine had to do some stretching to find a Coen negative. And it really has nothing to do with Coen at all. Injuries. … … The Bucs lost 50% of their scoring offense when wide receivers Mike Evans and Chris Godwin went down because of injuries, with Godwin out for the season. Mayfield is still performing at a high level but not having the threat of a downfield passing attack has hurt their chances. Yet even after Evans and Godwin went down, for the first two games after their injuries, Coen still got production. It only seemed in the last game, the loss to the 49ers, the loss of Evans and Godwin finally caught up with Coen. Joe can think of two potential negatives for Coen, and one is nitpicking. First, what has happened to Jalen McMillan and Trey Palmer? McMillan is nowhere close to the same receiver who was balling out in practice and training camp. Palmer? His numbers are way down. The second potential drawback for Coen is the final drive in the loss to the 49ers where the Bucs had to kick a field goal to tie the game (which the defense naturally shat the bed and couldn’t hold), Coen didn’t have arguably his best available offensive player on the field, Bucky Irving. It’s players, not plays. So Joe gets why the Bucs wanted Rachaad White on the field. He’s a better blocker and receiver. But he stinks running between the tackles, which is exactly what Coen called for — with all-too-predictable results. Other than those items, Coen has done such a solid job with the offense, “this Joe” believes Coen will be a head coach somewhere in 2025.|2024-11-20 13:00|377|32|7|Liam Coen|Coen excelling as Bucs' offensive coordinator despite minor setbacks.|0|Mixed sentiments about coaching staff performance|"""\""{\\\""commenter0\\\"": {\\\""username\\\"": \\\""Nutterbuccer\\\"", \\\""post\\\"": \\\""Yes head coach right here in Tampa no way the bucs keep Bowles after the season.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/11/bucs-defense-isnt-a-total-sieve-but-theyre-close/|Bucs Defense Isn’t A Total Sieve — But Close|Disturbing numbers for a defense coached up by a defensive-minded head coach. Joe remembers during the first season of Super Bowl-winning Bucco Bruce Arians’ days with the Bucs, his son, Jake Arians, remarked on Twitter about what he perceived as the sky-is-falling mentality of Bucs fans. He couldn’t believe how Bucs fans curled into a fetal position and expected disaster rather than getting behind their team. Well, the younger Mr. Arians never had to go through The Lost Decade. The two hallmarks of the Lost Decade were no edge rush and defenses that got boatraced. Sound familiar? Well, Joe read  stats yesterday from data scientist (highfalutin title for “statgeek”) Sam Hoppen, currently of FantasyPros and soon to be for BSPN Bet. He listed the explosive play rate for NFL defenses. (There are various definitions of explosive plays, depending on who is doing the numbercrunching. Hoppen defines explosive plays as pass or run plays of 15 yards or more.) When it comes to the Bucs, it’s gross. It seems 11 percent of opposing offenses’ plays against the Bucs defense go for 15 yards or more. That puts the Bucs’ defense at No. 25 for explosive play rate. The worst is the Browns who allow 12.5 percent of opponents’ plays to go for at least 15 yards. With the Bucs, it really doesn’t matter if it is the run or the pass. Some 2.5 percent of runs against the Bucs defense go for 15 yards or more. That’s No. 23 in the league — depressing considering how much Bucs head coach Todd Bowles stresses stopping the run. Pass defense? Hoppen has the Bucs ranked No. 24 with 8.7 percent of pass plays going for at least 15 yards. This may not be as bad as The Smiths (Lovie and Mike). But that’s a helluva consolation prize for a team on the brink of being out of the playoff chase.|2024-11-20 08:45|317|19|4|Bucs Defense|Defense struggling with explosive plays and playoff contention concerns.|3|Mixed sentiments with some optimism and some criticism towards the coaching staff.|"""\""{\\\""commenter0\\\"": {\\\""username\\\"": \\\""Timmy\\\"", \\\""post\\\"": \\\""I\\\\u2019m a relatively new fan.

And the software likes the Bucs’ chances of playing meaningful games in January more than most playoff guesstimates. In fact, Pro Football Network has the Bucs basically as a coin flip to make the playoffs, some 47.4 percent — better than the Dixie Chicks’ at 45.5 percent! Is that because whoever programmed this software believes the Dixie Chicks will choke like dogs? Does it mean the programmer is related to Todd Bowles? “This Joe” has to see with his own eyes the Bucs defense play much better before chugging the Kool-Aid. Hopeful, yes, but at the end of the day Joe lives in reality. And the Bucs’ defensive numbers are downright awful. In half the Bucs losses, opponents scored on the final drive of the game. That is three losses squarely on the defense. Of course, “this Joe” is more than a wee bit concerned with Bowles’ horrid history of losses coming off a bye week.
