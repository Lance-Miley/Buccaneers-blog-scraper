Wirfs has said he sought help from the team psychologist, but he went deeper into what was happening during his sitdown with The Pivot podcast. “I’m harder on myself than anybody. So it’s like, I was having these nightmares,” Wirfs explained. “I was like, ‘I’m not going to be good enough.’ Like I remember having nightmares giving up sacks, like clean, strip-sacks to end the game. There were nightmares where I couldn’t take a pass [protection] set. Just stupid stuff. And I’m like, ‘What am I doing?'” Overall, Wirfs said he was “freakin’ out” and dealing with stress tied to not being good enough and high expectations. He said his counseling was all about processes to “replace the negative thoughts with positive thoughts.” Interestingly, Wirfs’ anxiety returned when it came time to extend his contract last summer. The deal was being worked early in training camp and Wirfs was sitting out practice — and again freaking out. Wirfs said he got professional help again. The same doctor, per Wirfs, explained to him that “nobody’s worth that much money,” referring to his pending new contract, but that’s the market so he is worth it and must accept it. “Getting over that fear of not living up to that [contract]” is what Wirfs said he worked on, and he still feels that pressure of high expectations today. Simply stated. Wirfs cares a lot. And it’s a beautiful thing. Joe can relate to debilitating Bucs nightmares. It’s known around here as The Lost Decade of Buccaneers football. May it rest in peace.|2025-02-17 17:38:00|303|16|3|Tristan Wirfs|Wirfs struggles with anxiety and high expectations|4|Mix of pessimistic and optimistic comments with some focusing on mental health and positivity.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Tbbucs3"", ""post"": ""I think that some fans forget about how much pressure these athletes have to go through\u2026.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/chauncey-golston-and-the-bucs/|Chauncey Golston And The Bucs|The Bucs need upgrades at edge rusher/outside linebacker. Joe assumes the team is aware of this. No more chatter about the legendary practice play of José Ramirez and Markees Watts. No more tales about how Joe Tryon-Shoyinka is a multi-talented chess piece but fans can’t see it. Joe wants fresh bodies, including a beast of a proven edge rusher. But do the Bucs want to pay a huge price to get a proven beast? Doubtful. So Joe has been studying available edge rushers that might fit into the comfort zone of the Tampa Bay front office. Pending Cowboys free agent Chauncey Golston could be one of those guys. A late third-round pick by the Cowboys in 2021, Golston played in college at Iowa with Tristan Wirfs and Anthony Nelson. Buccaneers general manager Jason Licht surely saw plenty of college film on Golston and has great intel on what kind of guy he is. Golston was a durable backup with the Cowboys until last season. Then DeMarcus Lawrence and Micah Parsons got hurt early and Golston made 13 starts and walked away with 5 1/2 sacks and an interception. His stock went up at the right time, and he turned 26 years old this month. At 6-5, 270 pounds, Golston seems to fit the recent Bucs mold of preferring big dudes off the edge — guys that can mix it up well inside against the run. A Golston signing wouldn’t generate much applause from Bucs fans, but it might be a kind of quiet upgrade the team is seeking.|2025-02-17 12:59:00|258|31|5|Chauncey Golston|Bucs seek edge rusher upgrade with potential Cowboys free agent.|6|Mixed opinions on potential edge rusher signings, with some favoring Khalil Mack.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Lol"", ""post"": ""My wishlist; I would like the Bucs to bring in at least 2 additional edge rushers as well as retaining who we have now; Nelson, Shaq (Minus JTS).

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/louis-murphy-lay-off-of-todd-bowles/|Louis Murphy: “Lay Off Of Todd Bowles”|St. Peterburg native and retired Bucs and former Gators receiver Louis Murphy still lives locally and keeps track of his Buccaneers. Interesting to Joe was Murphy sounding very surprised that Bucs fans are on harsh on head coach Todd Bowles. His comments were delivered on The Rock Stops Here podcast with Joe’s buddy Rock Riley. “I personally know Todd Bowles. I did a coaching internship with Todd Bowles for like four months and I think he’s a great coach,” Murphy said. “I think we need to give a little grace. We’re in the playoffs every year with him. We have a chance, and we beat some really good teams this year. We beat the Eagles this year, beat the Lions.  …A perfect record doesn’t happen.” Murphy added that Bowles has a “stoic” style but there are varying coaching approaches. He said the Bucs overcame injuries to top-shelf players and still won the division — “injuries got us” — and that needs to be understood. “So you got a coach that’s dealing with all those injuries, man. Hey Bucs fans, I love you guys. Lay off of [Bowles],” Murphy said with conviction. Yes, there were a load of 2024 injuries to stud players, and that list includes the oft-forgotten setbacks to Calijah Kancey (5 games) and Luke Goedeke (4 games). Joe thinks it’s fair to say Murphy would have been among the 4.83 percent of fans who voted “Very Confident” in the latest Todd Bowles confidence poll here at JoeBucsFan.com.|2025-02-17 12:03:00|249|47|7|Louis Murphy|Murphy defends Todd Bowles amid fan criticism.|4|Mixed sentiment with some optimism but mostly criticism towards Todd Bowles.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""LouisFriend"", ""post"": ""Fortunately, Bowles doesn\u2019t read fan site comment forums like this.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/zyon-mccollum-is-not-the-problem/|Zyon McCollum Is Not The Problem|Joe admits to being nervous after the Bucs traded Carlton Davis last March. Joe had no real issue with Zyon McCollum, the replacement for Davis. However, in the 12 times McCollum did start in 2022 and 2023 (not unusual given lhow brittle Jamel Dean and Davis are), Joe thought he was just OK as a backup. But immediately after Davis was traded, Bucs coach Todd Bowles trumpeted McCollum as the new starter. Joe didn’t like that. Joe hadn’t seen enough of McCollum balling out in spot starts to be handed the starting job. Turns out Bowles knew what he was doing. In his first year as a starter in the NFL, McCollum ranked third in the NFL with 17 passes defensed. That’s great for a guy as a first-time starter, the same total Dean had as a rookie spot starter in 2019. But that wasn’t good enough for Walter Cherepinsky, the man behind WalterFootball.com. Cherepinsky thinks McCollum needs to be run or benched. Cornerback: Zyon McCollum played well for a stretch last year, but he was a major liability late in the season. Tampa Bay needs a better cornerback across from Jamel Dean. No, the liability was the corner, Dean, who can’t stay on the field, especially for playoff games. Joe has a hard time thinking a guy who had 17 passes defensed in his first year as a starter has to be replaced. At bare minimum, that tells Joe that McCollum is a player you want. It is not McCullom who needs to be replaced, Joe believes, it is Dean. Joe’s only issue with Dean is that he can’t stay upright and in the team’s biggest games, he’s often not on the field. Joe has a hard time believing a seven-year veteran like Dean, who turns 29 in October, will suddenly stop being injury-prone.|2025-02-17 10:30:00|305|41|7|Zyon McCollum|McCollum proves himself but faces criticism from some analysts.|2|Mixed sentiments regarding players, coaches, and defensive scheme, with some optimism and criticism.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""First Name Greatest"", ""post"": ""Funny reading commentary from national pundits, you can tell how badly they do not pay attention to this team"", ""post_time"": [""February"", ""17th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""10:35"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Steven #55"", ""post"": ""National Pundits are idiots \u2013 See Power Rankings as an example.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/complimenting-you-down-linemen/|Helping Your Down Linemen Improve|Joe knows the Bucs have an underrated unit on their defense. No, it’s not inside linebackers, where the Bucs may have to fill two starting holes. No, not the secondary where Joe thinks a new starting corner is needed and maybe a safety, too. It’s the defensive line, the three down linemen (not to be confused with the so-called edge rushers or outside linebackers). Joe understands people like to rag on Logan Hall. Yes, in a perfect world Joe would hope the guy would be dominant as a 33rd overall draft pick. But he had a solid year last season basically as the new Will Gholston. No, Hall is not a Pro Bowler, but he did what coaches asked of him. So Joe can’t destroy him for that. Calijah Kancey and Vita Vea? Name a better one-two punch at defensive tackle not located in Philadelphia. Vea is a beast, that’s all there is to it. Kancey is way underrated. If he can escape training camp on two feet, he could be dominant. He already is against the run. Want to know how to make these three guys even better? If the Bucs would just embrace the real world and modern football (“modern” being the past 50 years) and go get a proven edge rusher. Dan Pompei of The Athletic thinks a quality edge rusher could turn the Bucs’ front-five into a force. The Bucs’ leading sackers last season were defensive tackles Calijah Kancey and Vita Vea, who had 7.5 and 7, respectively. A little more juice off the edge would complement the tackles and outside linebacker Yaya Diaby as well as enhance the pass defense, which ranked 29th in the NFL and generated only seven interceptions. The Bucs also might have to replace Joe Tryon-Shoyinka, a former first-round pick who has started the last three years. Tryon-Shoyinka will be a free agent. Joe would be very surprised if Joe Tryon-Shoyinka is back. If the Bucs thought they could squeeze any juice from that lemon, they wouldn’t have pulled Shaq out of mothballs. Put a proven edge rusher on this team, someone who has had 10 sacks in a season and won’t be distracted by the bong, and watch this defensive line explode. Joe likens it to when Vea returned in the playoffs for the 2020 season. When he was on the field against the Packers, they simply did not have enough bodies to take care of Jason Pierre-Paul, Shaq Barrett, Ndamukong Suh and Vea. Shaq went bananas and hounded drama queen Aaron Rodgers the whole game. And the Super Bowl win over Kansas City was a repeat of that. Get a real edge rusher in there and Vea and Kancey will go crazy. And it’s a fair bet that YaYa Diaby blows up as well.|2025-02-17 08:00:00|465|20|7|Helping Your Down Linemen Improve|Underrated defensive line needs proven edge rusher for improvement.|4|Mixed feelings on team dynamics, player performance, and positional needs.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Bojim"", ""post"": ""I like Hall.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/the-year-of-the-running-back/|The Year Of The Running Back|One could argue that 2024 was the “Year of the Running Back.” It sure was for the Bucs. Take away rookie Bucky Irving; do the Bucs finish fourth in the NFL in rushing? Joe would say, No way.” That doesn’t mean Rachaad White couldn’t have had a decent season. It doesn’t mean Sean Tucker was incapable of having a good year. It’s just that Irving helped the Bucs’ running attack explode from its place as worst in the league in 2022 and 2023. It wasn’t only the Bucs that enjoyed extremely proficient running. As Kay Adams pointed out last month, three running backs, Derrick Henry, Saquon Barkley and Jahmyr Gibbs, each posted one of the top-ten yards-per-carry averages in NFL history last season. All three in the top-10 in the same season? That’s beyond bizarre. And this happened in the same season when the Bucs ranked fourth in rushing. So is this a trend? Is running is once again king in the NFL like in the 1970s, or is this a wild fluke? If the Bucs are going with the trend (if it is a trend) and want to stick with a ground-and-pound offense, is Team Glazer going to want to pay $20+ million a season each to Mike Evans and Chris Godwin while the Bucs have a ton of holes on defense? Godwin is a pending free agent. If he hits the market, he will have suitors, with Washington maybe being the most prominent. Might Team Glazer intead instruct Bucs AC/DC-loving general manager Jason Licht to spend Godwin’s potential salary on defensive players? It’s a question for which Joe doesn’t have an answer, but we’ll soon find out when free agency arrives in three weeks. The next month ought to be fun, and maybe surprising.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/draft-success/|Draft Success|A lot of fans grumble about Bucs coach Todd Bowles because they feel the Bucs should have won more than 10 games. They blame Bowles for holding the team back. Well, if you figure the Bucs are a 12-win (or more?) team, then Bucs AC/DC-loving general manager Jason Licht and his staff are getting the job done. The Bucs tied for third in the NFL with the highest percentage of first- and second-round draft picks starting for their teams during the 2024 season. The Eagles are the only 2024 division winner who had a higher percent of first- and second-round dpics in their starting lineup. The Bucs’ percentage of starters from their first- and second-round draft picks is 80 percent. The Eagles have 90. The Bears were highest at 91 percent. They’re a garbage team. So that’s not getting the job done. The slimy Saints are tied with the Bucs at 80 percent. The slimy Saints stink. Such a pity.
