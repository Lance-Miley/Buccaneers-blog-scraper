https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/3-million-reasons-mike-evans-keeps-the-streak-alive/|3 Million Reasons Mike Evans Keeps The Streak Alive|Yes, the NFL is a business. That’s why the Bucs sent three consecutive short passes to lunatic Antonio Brown and asked Ronald Jones to block for him as the 2020 season closed in a game the Bucs won 44-27. Brown had a cash incentive on the line. Jones? Pffft, all he had was 978 yards rushing and a hunger for 1,000. Brown earned the Team Glazer loot and then paid legal bills, Joe presumes, and bought himself a phony vaccine card. (To further insult Jones, Tom Brady took a knee on the final three snaps following the three throws to Brown.) Money matters in the NFL and some coaches will help players get their incentive bonuses. That brings Joe to tomorrow when Mike Evans has $3 million on the line, per USA Today and NBC. Evans has 65 catches, 915 yards and 11 touchdowns on the season. That leaves him just five catches and 85 yards short of hitting a $3 million bonus that triggers when he totals 70 catches, 1,000 yards and 10 touchdowns. Oh, and those 85 yards would tie him with Jerry Rice for the All-Time record of 11 consecutive seasons of 1,000 or more yards receiving. Would head coach Todd Bowles have the stones to sit Evans before he got the record of the bonus money? Suppose the Bucs jump out to a 24-0 halftime lead and Evans has 3 catches for 38 yards. Would Bowles dares to insist on his star resting for the playoffs? The Joe typing here doesn’t think Bowles would dare do it. However, it’s at least worth noting that Saquon Barkley is sitting out tomorrow with the NFL’s all-time, single-season rushing record on the line, and Ravens 1,000-yard receiver Zay Flowers went down with a knee injury this afternoon.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/down-year-for-edge-rushers/|Down Year For Edge Rushers|So the NFL had 22 double-digit pass rushers last season. That number has been cut in half this season with one game remainng. It’s been a hell of a dropoff. Trey Hendrickson (Bengals) and Myles Garrett (Browns) co-lead the NFL with 14 sacks. Don’t expect to see either in the postseason. Commanders cheap free agent pickup Dante Fowler, Jr. has been the surprise edge rusher of the season with 10 1/2 sacks. Damn good for $3.2 million. Joe brings this us as perspective for the sad pass rushing season being had by Bucs edge rushers. Anthony Nelson leads the unit with four sacks. Joe nearly had a tanrum because the Bucs didn’t chase a quality edge rusher in free agency this offseason. Super Bowls are always won by teams with a strong edge rusher, Joe assessed, so Joe was not cool with the Bucs not prioritizing the position. Now one could say the Vikings are kicking ass this season because they added edge rusher Jonathan Greenard in free agency (11 sacks), but that’s silly because he simply replaced double-digit sack man Danielle Hunter (12 sacks), who bolted in free agency for Houston. A lot of the big-name edge rushers available on the offseason were a whole lot of meh or worse. Was Buccaneers Ring of Honor general manager Jason Licht crazy like a fox to roll with his group? Well, Joe can’t go that far. But this may be the year a team wins a Super Bowl without a dominant edge rusher. And man, if Bucs sacks king Shaq Barrett actually shows up as a dangerous playoff performer, Licht is going to look like more of a rock star than he is.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/bucs-scare-offensive-linemen/|Bucs Scare Offensive Linemen|No, this post has nothing to do with the Tampa Bay edge rush or tomorrow’s return of Bucs sacks king Shaq Barrett. It’s about how retired offensive linemen view the Bucs as a giant that analysts are snoozing on for the postseason. “I think the Bucs are the sleeper team to me,” said Amazon analyst and retired left tackle Andrew Whitworth, the four-time Pro Bowler. “They’re that team that you have no idea. I mean, I’m sure gambling people hate the Buccaneers because you have zero idea who they’re going to be week in and week out. “I feel like they could show up and beat the No. 1 or No. 2 [seed] and you’d be like, ‘You know what? That’s Tampa.” Whitworth was chatting on his podcast with ex-Bucs QB Ryan Fitzpatrick, who agreed with his co-host. Justin Pugh, the 11-year guard and tackle, was adamant about the Bucs on the Clean Pocket podcast. “They are built for the playoffs. They are built for this run,” he said. Co-host A.Q. Shipley, a Bucs backup center in 2020 and assistant coach in 2021, trains Bucs center Robert Hainsey privately and is known for candid takes on ESPN. He, too, was firm about the Bucs. “If I’m any team in the NFC, I do not want to play the Bucs,” Shipley said. “People don’t realize about the Bucs; they’re top-5 in almost every rushing category. They fit playoff football. Almost everything about them fits playoff fooball.” Joe thinks the Bucs fit playoff football, too, though their defense isn’t postseason-caliber. Still, there are enough playmakers on that side of the ball to give the mighty Bucs offense a chance to outscore playoff opponents.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/bucs-offensive-line-has-baker-mayfields-back-on-and-off-the-field/|Bucs’ Offensive Line Has Baker Mayfield’s Back On And Off The Field|Joe remembers former Bucs great Warren Sapp saying this and it’s so true. Sapp, partially joking (?) and explaining the typical dynamics of an NFL locker room, said of offensive linemen, “They’re like cattle. They herd together.” And he’s right. In the locker room, no matter the team or the year, rarely do offensive linemen mingle with others. They stick together like a pack. Maybe tight ends might be embraced but other than that, they have their own little corner of the locker room. Bucs offensive linemen are a little different. Quarterback Baker Mayfield is one of them. He’s part of their fraternity. It’s common for Mayfield to hang outside of One Buc Palace with Tristan Wirfs, Robert Hainsey and others. So last week when it was announced that Mayfield, who is on the cusp of joining a rare quarterback club of mostly Hall of Famers, guess who had Mayfield’s back, sticking up for their quarterback thinking he got hosed in not being named as a Pro Bowler? Bucs offensive linemen, that’s who. While Mayfield was named an alternate, the guys protecting Mayfield’s back on the field had his back off the field. “Incredible!” Bucs right tackle Luke Goedeke said of Baker getting the short end of the stick. “He definitely deserves to make the Pro Bowl as a starter. “He’s done it all for us. He plays every game like it is his last. He checks all the boxes. Yeah, I believe he was snubbed.” Right guard Cody Mauch agreed. “Yeah, I’d say,” Mauch said when asked if Mayfield got dissed. “I don’t know if there are many quarterbacks better than Baker this year. Baker has been just a stud. “I don’t know what goes into [selecting Pro Bowlers]. I think Baker is one of [the best].” Left tackle Tristan Wirfs, who was named a Pro Bowl starter, said overlooking his good friend angers the entire offensive line. “Baker doesn’t get the credit he deserves,” Wirfs said. “And it chaps our ass.” Bucs offensive coordinator Liam Coen swore Mayfield doesn’t give two flips over the Pro Bowl. “He knows his worth,” Coen said. “He knows what he’s done and put out on that field this year production-wise.” Goedeke put Mayfield’s Pro Bowl status in proper perspective. “The Pro Bowl is not the end all, be all,” Goedeke said. Mayfield knows what meaningful football honors are: postseason wins. And frankly, that begins tomorrow with a win-and-in game against the slimy Saints.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/slimy-saints-at-bucs-tv-map/|Slimy Saints At Bucs, TV Map|You poor Bucs fans in North Florida. Why does the NFL hate you so much?  The Bucs are in a win-and-in game against the slimy Saints. The stakes don’t get much bigger. Beat the slimy Saints and the Bucs host a playoff game next weekend. Lose and the season is likely over (unless former Bucs offensive coordinator Dave Canales and the Stinking Panthers do the Bucs a solid and pull off a road upset at the Dixie Chicks). So guess which part of Florida doesn’t get the Bucs game and instead is assaulted with the Jags-Colts? You’ve got it: North Florida. Surprisingly, a good chunk of the republic will get the slimy Saints-Bucs game free via the public’s airwaves from their local FOX affiliate. Just about the entire left coast west of the Rockies will get the Bucs from their local FOX affiliate, as will about 60 percent of the country east of the Mississippi River. For those not receiving the Bucs game from the airwaves floating over their home, it’s Sunday Ticket for you or off to the local watering hole. Jeff Burkhardt, Tom Brady and Erin Andrews will handle the call. Of course, Joe always encourages fans to hit up their neighborhood Hooters for cold beer, hot wings and the legendary Hooters girls. Oh yeah, and football on the flatscreens, too.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/stats-damned-stats-and-the-four-letter/|Stats, Damned Stats And The Four-Letter|Look, Joe has been over this many times. Joe is not anti-stats (he is anti-PFF tribe grades — there is a major difference). Stats are nothing but information. Who is against information? But stats without context is fool’s gold, which brings Joe to this Seth Walder of BSPN, a man who never met a number he didn’t like. Walder loves to throw out numbers but Joe swears he never uses context. If a number suggests something, that’s it. Case closed. Never adds context or nuance. Take Bucs edge rusher YaYa Diaby. Joe loves YaYa but he hasn’t had the season many expected after a promising rookie season. He’s only had 1.5 sacks in his last nine games. All of those 1.5 sacks came in the last two weeks. Maybe he’s turning the corner? But to read this Walder rave about Diaby’s win-rates, you’d think the Bucs had the second coming of Jared Allen on their roster. Bold prediction: Bucs edge rusher Yaya Diaby will record a sack. Diaby is hot, with a 22% pass rush win rate at edge since Week 14 that ranks sixth in that span, along with 1.5 sacks in his past two games. In Week 18, he’ll mostly face rookie Taliese Fuaga, whose 83% pass block win rate ranks 59th out of 66 tackles. So let Joe get this straight: So a “win-rate” of 22 percent is good? Not 88 percent, but 22 percent? Joe’s a word guy, and 22 percent “win rate” seems more like a “lose-rate.” The way Walder is crowing about Diaby’s win-rate, Joe would expect a lot more production than just 1.5 sacks in the last two games. But hey, that’s just Joe. Joe will just type this: If the Bucs believed Diaby was as dominant as Walder claims, then why are the Bucs fooling around bringing Shaq Barrett out of mothballs? Something doesn’t add up here.|2025-01-04 10:00:00|315|34|3|Yaya Diaby|Skeptical view on stats-backed praise of edge rusher Diaby.|5|Mixed opinions on player performance and potential impact, some optimism, some skepticism.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Bucsfan"", ""post"": ""Depth acquisition"", ""post_time"": [""Bucsfan""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Joe Tryin but Stinka"", ""post"": ""Because JTS sucks!"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""4th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""10:13"", ""am""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""Hawk"", ""post"": ""I don\u2019t understand your confusion.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/lavonte-david-on-playing-in-2025/|Lavonte David On Playing In 2025|Of course, Joe hopes like heck the following doesn’t happen. We all know the Bucs are in a win-and-in game on Sunday. Beat the slimy Saints, and the Bucs host a playoff game next weekend. Bbbuuuttt… lose and there is a good chance tomorrow will be the Bucs’ final game of the 2024 season. Sure, the Bucs would have to pray that the Dixie Chicks lose to the Stinking Panthers at home and the Bucs could backdoor their way into the playoffs. Joe doesn’t want to think about such depressing thoughts. If the worst happens, then yesterday could have been Bucs legend Lavonte David’s final practice. The 13-year vet and personification of professionalism turns 35 later this month. Last winter, David toyed with hanging up his cleats but decided to return. While a few, very few times, he began showing some signs of age. Just a little. But only flashes. How good has David been this year? With two sacks tomorrow, he would set a career-high for sacks in a season. At age 34! “I had no idea!” David said when Joe told him about this stat. “Shoot, let’s hope we can get that. I’d love to have that.” David’s current career-best is seven sacks in 2013. He currently has 5.5. Even better, this season, in the four games David has recorded a sack (or more than one), the Bucs are 4-0. “I definitely got to get one then,” David said with a smile. However, that’s the fun stuff. About 2025? Joe asked David yesterday if he’s made any decision about returning in 2025 or if not, when he may make a decision. “No, no thoughts,” David said. “No thoughts right now,” David said. So he doesn’t know. When Joe asked him what the positives and negatives would be in coming back or not coming back, David repeated what he said earlier. “I’m not even thinking about it.” David said he hasn’t put any thought into that because he’s so locked in with the Bucs. He’s trying to help the team get to the playoffs. After the season there will be ample time to sit down and collect his thoughts. “Trying to take care of business,” David said. David this week was named as a Pro Bowl alternate. It’s been an annual rite around these parts to be outraged by yet another snub of the Pro Bowl by the NFL community. Joe asked David if he was upset by it. In so many words, David, who used to get upset by the annual dissing, admits it doesn’t even register with him now. It seems like he has come to expect it. “It’s behind me, it’s all behind me man,” David said. “It’s a blessing to be considered as an alternate, but it’s all behind me. I’m older and wiser now. I’m not letting that bring me down.” His drive instead is helping the Bucs keep their season alive.|2025-01-04 08:00:00|488|23|5|Lavonte David|Lavonte David uncertain about playing in 2025.|7|Fans express admiration and hope for Lavonte David despite concerns about his future and replacements.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Drunk Bucs Fan"", ""post"": ""I hope everyone appreciates the privilege we have had of watching LD and ME the last decade."", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""4th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""8:06"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Bojim"", ""post"": ""HOF.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/baker-mayfield-on-cusp-of-rare-feat/|Baker Mayfield On Cusp Of Rare Feat|If Bucs quarterback Baker Mayfield only has an average game tomorrow, he will join an elite group of quarterbacks where only one will not be a member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Mayfield is one touchdown and 221 passing yards shy of this elite group. Only nine quarterbacks have thrown for 40 touchdowns and 4,500 passing yards in the same season. The list of the group reads like a Who’s Who of quarterbacks in the past 40 years. Tom Brady, Drew Brees, Joe Burrow, Andrew Luck, Pat Mahomes, Peyton Manning, Dan Marino, drama queen Aaron Rodgers and Matt Stafford. The only quarterback on that list who will not be in the Pro Football Hall of Fame (Manning and Marino are already in) is Andrew Luck. His career was cut short due to injuries. Also, if Mayfield throws for one touchdown pass, he will become only the second Bucs quarterback to throw for at least 40 touchdowns in a season. Brady did this with the Bucs in 2020 and 2021. |2025-01-04 00:00:00|171|42|7|Baker Mayfield|Mayfield close to elite QB group|3|Mixed sentiments ranging from skepticism, optimism, respect, and criticism towards various players and achievements.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""BillyBucco"", ""post"": ""And he didn\u2019t even make the Pro Bowl."", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""4th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""12:14"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""OR Buc"", ""post"": ""Baker Gonna Bake"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""4th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""12:27"", ""am""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""Joseph C Simmons"", ""post"": ""Andrew Luck\u2019s career was cut short by his retirement at a very young age, presumably because he was tired of rehabbing injuries.
