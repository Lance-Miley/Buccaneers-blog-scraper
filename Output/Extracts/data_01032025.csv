Last month after former NFL general manager Michael Lombardi claimed on his former podcast, “GM Shuffle,” that he heard through NFL circles that Bucs coach Todd Bowles was going to retire, Bowles on the record told both Joe and Ira Kaufman, separately, that he had zero plans on retiring this winter. And, since the Bucs are on the cusp of 10 wins, which would give the Bowles his third straight NFC South division title in as many seasons, Joe could not imagine Team Glazer moving on from Bowles. But if Team Glazer were moved to make a switch, Tom Pelissero of NFL Network told Rich Eisen today, that one replacement name to keep in mind has a significant history with the Bucs. Hell, the guy got the Bucs and Team Glazer their first Super Bowl ring. That would be Chucky. Pelissero was discussing who the Jets may eye to hire and he noted that the Jets could be looking for an offensive coach “with pelts on the wall.” He threw Chucky’s name out, which began a brief breakdown of Chucky being a popular candidate with several NFL teams. And maybe the Bucs. “Offensive coaches who have had success as head coaches,” Pelissero speculated what the Jets are looking for. “Jon Gruden is on that list. That is a name I fully anticipate you are going to hear. I believe there will be interest in Jon Gruden this time around.” Pelissero rattled off a few teams that would be interested in Chucky. including the slimy Saints. Pelissero added Chucky could have been the slimy Saints offensive coordinator this season if he wanted the job. And then Pelissero dropped this in almost as a throwaway line about a team interested in hiring Chucky. ” … the Buccaneers, if they were to make a change.” When Pelissero said this, very audibly you could hear Eisen hum in surprise. Again, Bowles has stated emphatically he’s not retiring. Of course, this was before his son, linebacker Troy Bowles, decided to transfer from Georgia to Michigan. SEC football stadiums are much easier to travel to from Tampa than B1G football stadiums. Seattle, Los Angeles, Eugene and State College are a bit trickier to reach than Atlanta, Austin or Jacksonville. Besides, Team Glazer currently has one of the brightest offensive minds in the game already in the building should Bowles leave (voluntarily or involuntarily). For Joe, if Bowles for whatever reason walks out of One Buc Palace, it would be Liam Coen who should be the no-brainer hire, not Chucky.|2025-01-03 17:59:00|449|101|4|Chucky|"Speculation on potential coaching change for the Buccaneers with ""Chucky."""|2|Mixed sentiments include praise for Coen and criticism reserved for Gruden and Bowles.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Leopold Stotch"", ""post"": ""No. Coen."", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""3rd,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""6:02"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""bucsfan951"", ""post"": ""No thanks at all.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/prime-times-for-baker-mayfield/|Prime Times For Baker Mayfield|BY IRA KAUFMAN Not bad for a bridge quarterback. It’s easy to forget the Bucs had no idea what they were getting when signing free agent Baker Mayfield to a one-year deal for $4 million plus incentives in March of 2023. The initial thought for many at One Buc Place was that Mayfield would hold down the position until Tampa Bay could draft its future face of the franchise. Plans change.  That face now wears No. 6 and features a scowl. Mayfield also happens to be one of the NFL’s best quarterbacks in 2024 as we approach Sunday’s regular season finale against New Orleans. It’s not a stretch to suggest Mayfield has been a revelation in Tampa. His career was at a crossroads when he arrived and now he has Todd Bowles and the Bucs on the brink of another NFC South title … and perhaps the NFC’s No. 3 playoff seed. Mayfield’s 39 TD passes rank second in the league and his 71.7 percent completion percentage is tied for second. He’s third in passing yards per game and No. 4 in passer rating. Most importantly, Tampa Bay averages 29.7 points (fourth) and ranks third in total yards. And Liam Coen’s offense is closing with a rush, averaging 33 points since the bye week. Where would the Bucs be without Mayfield? Tampa Bay fans shudder at the thought. And at the age of 29, he’s just approaching his prime. Mayfield has won over Buc Nation with his moxie and competitive drive. When the pocket breaks down, he doesn’t think twice about sacrificing his body on scrambles. And while he’ll never be confused with Lamar Jackson or Josh Allen, Mayfield has run for 310 yards and 21 first downs this season. For context, Patrick Mahomes has rushed for 307 yards and 22 first downs. That bridge quarterback is now directing traffic for the league’s No. 1 third-down offense, converting exactly 100-of-200 opportunities. How about the red zone, you ask? The Bucs rank fourth in the league in cashing in when reaching the opponent’s 20-yard line. After Mayfield’s first season with the Bucs, general manager Jason Licht explained why Tampa Bay had an interest in No. 6 when few others gave him a second look. “Bruce (Arians) has always been a big Baker fan,” Licht said. “He’s always been in my ear and in Todd’s ear. It’s tough for a quarterback to step into Brady’s shoes — and Baker wasn’t afraid to do it.” The Bucs will head into the 2025 draft knowing they have their franchise quarterback. That’s a comforting feeling, one Saints fans envy. New Orleans went 49-15 in the four years before Drew Brees called it quits. Since 2021, the Saints are 30-37, with Jameis Winston, Andy Dalton and Derek Carr taking turns operating under center. “You can see the energy Mayfield brings,” says Woods, a former defensive quality coach for the Bucs. “He has a little of that gunslinger mentality. They’re playing really well together as an offense.” A robust ground game has certainly helped, but Mayfield sets the tone with his feisty approach. Bowles has liked No. 6 since the Browns made Mayfield the top overall pick in the 2018 draft. All it took was one season to win Bowles over completely. “Baker has the keys to the bus,” Bowles said in the offseason. “He’s driving it.” The Saints need a quarterback — and the Buccaneers do not. That’s a huge edge for Licht as he tries to fill holes on defense in 2025. Bowles craves ball security and there’s been only one game this season, an overtime win at Carolina, when Mayfield has thrown more interceptions than TD passes. Buc fans forgive Mayfield’s mistakes because they appreciate his bold, aggressive style. When he arrived in Tampa, he wisely said he wouldn’t try to be another Tom Brady. He just wanted to be Baker Mayfield. Buc Nation chants in unison: we love you just the way you are. |2025-01-03 13:03:00|661|50|8|Baker Mayfield|Mayfield excels as unexpected standout quarterback for Bucs.|8|Overall positive sentiment towards Baker and the Bucs, with confidence in future success.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Tiff, Okla,Bake, Bucs 4 life"", ""post"": ""Yes we do luv Baker just the waY he is!!!!!!\ud83e\udd29 n"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""3rd,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""1:22"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""BakerFan"", ""post"": ""The Baker haters are grinding their teeth while explaining that they are really Bucs fan\u2026. yeah right."", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""3rd,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""1:24"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""Boge"", ""post"": ""Coen and Baker are a great combo to watch, sucks it\u2019s already week 18."", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""3rd,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""1:28"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter3"": {""username"": ""Timbucs2"", ""post"": ""I believed in him from day 1.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/larry-foote-intrigued-with-the-return-of-shaq-barrett/|Larry Foote Intrigued By Shaq Barrett Return|It was Larry Foote’s turn yesterday to play coordinator. The NFL requires teams’ offensive and defensive coordinators to speak to media weekly. The Bucs don’t have a defensive coordinator because head coach Todd Bowles runs the defense. So each week, Bowles has defensive line coach Kacy Rodgers and inside linebackers coach Foote take turns fielding questions. Yesterday, Foote had an interesting answer. He was asked why Bucs sacks king Shaq Barrett pulled an Undertaker, rose up and rejoined the Bucs after spending months in retirement. “When you realize that Monday check isn’t coming in there (laughs), it’s tough, it’s difficult,” Foote joked. Foote seems to think Shaq is a prideful man and that motivated him to re-sign last week. Coming off an Achilles injury that sidelined him for half the 2022 season, Shaq simply was not himself in 2023. He had 4.5 sacks and just a half-sack in his last seven games. In March, the Bucs made the very uncomfortable decision to move on. Foote is confident Shaq wants to redeem his street cred now, when the Bucs’ have must-win games. “I know he was coming off the Achillies and he just didn’t feel himself,” Foote said. “Once that body starts coming back, you start itching and wanting to play the game. “You know you’re always going to miss it but when that body starts coming back and you feel good, you’re going to want to get back out there.” Shaq said yesterday in the Bucs locker room his comeback is no stunt. He’s looking to play at least in 2025 and 2026, and maybe through 2027, as he said he’d like to play “Two or three more years.”|2025-01-03 09:05:00|279|24|5|Larry Foote|Shaq Barrett’s return to Bucs after retirement and injury.|5|Mixed sentiments on Shaq's return, with hopes for success and concerns about his performance.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Beeej"", ""post"": ""The Bucs could not let him stay on at the 15 million or whatever it was he was making last year, but the same production is worth $2 or 3 million for sure"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""3rd,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""9:12"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""A Bucs Fan"", ""post"": ""2 years with a 3rd year option for a total value of 23 million would be an ideal deal for the Shaq man."", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""3rd,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""9:36"", ""am""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""Bill Kilmer"", ""post"": ""Hey Joe, we know from an achilles injury  takes usually longer than a year and has ended the career of quite a few good players.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/364679/|Feeding Bucky Irving|So last week Bucs offensive coordinator Liam Coen didn’t screw around. He knew the Bucs needed a win. So what did he do? He got the ball in his best players’ hands. One of those players is Bucs running back Bucky Irving. Coen fed Irving early and often and the Bucs seal-clubbed the Stinking Panthers. Joe doesn’t believe in coincidences in football. “His ability to make people miss in space while also threatening the defense in multiple ways helps us get going early on,” Coen said. “It gets things moving and then we can really kind of say, ‘OK, now let’s get the guys in specific [spots] where we want [them].’” Coen said using Bucky early was following his motto. “We’re just trying to start fast and continue to do so, knowing that, obviously, that’s been a decent recipe for us,” Coen said. “Just getting him going helps us get going. He’s done a great job so far. Really, again, I don’t know how many times he touched it during the game – it was under 20, I think. He’s still not getting beat on while also having high production, while now, also, some of those other guys can get in and help us out that way, as well.” Starting fast is critical for this team. Joe will type again one of the weirdest stats out there. The Bucs are 9-1 when they score first; winless when they don’t. Even when a team gets a 3-0 lead, even with the Bucs having one of the best offenses in the NFL, they somehow cannot overcome a 3-0 deficit. That’s just weird. So Joe wouldn’t be surprised if Bucky gets the ball a lot in the early going on Sunday.

The slimy Saints haven’t exactly said starting quarterback Derek Carr will start Sunday in Tampa as he is dealing with an injured left hand.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/liam-coen-explains-why-devin-culp-is-finally-making-an-impact/|Liam Coen Explains Why Devin Culp Is Finally Making An Impact|UPDATED: It took a rare injury to a key player for Bucs reserve tight end rookie Devin Culp to finally get on the field and make an impact. On Sunday, Culp had three catches for 52 yards. Those were his first career catches. One reason Culp only played a few snaps before Sunday was a log jam at tight end. He’s the No. 3 when it comes to being a full-time pass-catching tight end. Ko Kieft is ahead of him on run plays. Culp also hadn’t yet made an impact because the offense he was used to in college was a spread-option, where coaches signal in plays to the team. The NFL and the spread-option don’t mix. That offense is borderline foreign to the NFL, though some NFL teams use some of its traits. The offense used with Culp at Washington last year — you know the kind, where the quarterback claps for a cadence rather than barking plays — is an irritant to Chucky. He often tees off on the clapping offenses on one of his many Barstool Sports platforms. It seems Bucs offensive coordinator Liam Coen is no fan of those college offenses. Coen said yesterday Culp finally is used to how Coen runs an offense, which is far different than what Culp saw at Washington. “Yeah, that’s what I kind of always say, is like, what’s wrong about the no-huddle offense and quarterbacks in high school and Pop Warner are looking at the sideline for a play,” Coen began. “Don’t speak. Don’t say a word. Get up to the line of scrimmage. Don’t speak. Don’t say a word. Clap for the cadence. Don’t speak. Don’t say a word. “This game is about communication, and how we play this game in terms of [the] huddle, the calls, the communication that we have to do is what’s wrong with our [society].” (Joe’s note: Joe believes Coen said “society” but the word he used is sort of inaudible but “society” makes sense given what he said immediately after.) Coen then added that it’s common for people now to text rather than have conversations. And sometimes he finds players mirror that culture and he must work with rookies for them to understand they can’t text in a huddle. “Everybody just texts,” Coen said. “They don’t speak to each other. That’s what’s wrong. I tell the high school coaches all the time, it’s what’s wrong. Talking to each other, we don’t talk. “And it’s one of those things where [Culp has] had to get in the huddle, hear a play call, multiple calls, and be able to go out and execute that at a high level. That’s not easy to do for anybody that’s never done it. “So glad to see him being able to contribute, and hopefully be able to continue to do some more moving forward.” Joe fully understands why NFL coaches are not fond of the spread-option and the clapping. But this is the first time Joe had heard it explained the way Coen did. So it isn’t just Todd Bowles’ defense that sometimes has to struggle with a lack of communication. Coen does, too. And now Joe wonders if what Coen detailed is part of what Bowles means when he keeps referring to communication. (A Bucs administrator once told Joe years ago that players learning to converse is a real issue because, as Coen detailed, they just text. This same suit told Joe that sometimes players will play a video game on their phones with teammates in the locker room and rather than talking or hollering back and forth during the game, they text each other while they are all still at their lockers.)|2025-01-03 00:00:00|616|29|5|Devin Culp|Rookie tight end adjusting to NFL communication style.|7|Mixed sentiments with praise for learning and improvement, but frustration with communication issues affecting rookies.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Mr_Barf"", ""post"": ""That there is an Coach.

Culp is being asked to learn an entirely different language when he hasn\u2019t even been asked to learn the alphabet before, so of course he\u2019s going to struggle (could be the reason why he lasted until the 7th considering his physical gifts). It\u2019s really no different than a player coming in with a learning disability that struggles to pick up the playbook, even though his team ran a pro-style offense in college.
