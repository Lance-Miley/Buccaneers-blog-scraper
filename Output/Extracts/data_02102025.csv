https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/predictable-running-game-scrapped/|Predictable Running Game Scrapped|Joe heard this and wanted to point a finger of shame in Todd Bowles’ direction. The Buccaneers’ legendary left tackle, Tristan Wirfs, sat down with former Pro Bowl Bears guard Kyle Long during Super Bowl week and explained that Bucs’ running game in past years was too predictable for defenses. Wirfs praised departed Bucs playcaller Liam Coen for capitalizing on the athleticism of the Bucs’ offensive line by getting the line moving and running off the ball and keeping the run game diverse. He also pointed most to Coen’s use of presnap motion. “I think that was the biggest thing,” Wirfs said at a CBS spot on Media Row. “Liam started using the presnap motions to kind of slow the defense down. Because a lot of the time in previous years, it’s like, we’d line up and run the ball and we’re like, ‘Ok. They know what’s coming. We’re running duo. Everyone runs duo. … But it’s like they knew what we were doing. So now it’s like he just added little variations to stuff.” Perhaps Joe is being harsh, but Bowles was head coach during years when the Bucs’ run game was predictable and plodding. Surely, as a defensive coordinator, Bowles could see that in his offense yet the fixes didn’t come. Coen did not invent presnap motion. Why didn’t Bowles demand a less predicatable run game?|2025-02-10 15:42:00|228|42|6|Todd Bowles|Wirfs praises diverse running game|2|Mixed opinions, some criticisms but also some support and appreciation expressed.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""FilthyAnimal"", ""post"": ""To be fair, he Bowles asked for variation and less predictability in the running game from Leftwich and that staff.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/lavonte-david-may-burst-some-bucs-fans-dreams/|Lavonte David May Burst (Some) Fans’ Dreams|Look, no one, and Joe means no one, has hollered, barked, destroyed a keyboard and slammed a fist so hard on the desk it spilled coffee all over creation because the Bucs haven’t stopped playing games and gotten a proven edge rusher. No one has screamed about this more than Joe. And until or unless this massive hole on the Bucs roster is fixed, Joe will continue to do so. A lot of Bucs fans (Joe is not among them today) want the Bucs to draft an edge rusher in the first round in April. In theory, this is a good idea. But Joe doesn’t trust Todd Bowles to develop a rookie. Why? He’s never done so. Now Joe knows people will throw Cam Wake in Joe’s face. When Wake joined the Dolphins, Bowles was primarily a secondary coach in Miami. Yes, he was an interim head coach once with the Dolphins, but his primary focus on position groups was secondary. So Joe doesn’t know how much if any credit goes to Bowles that Wake blew up in 2010 with 14 sacks. Maybe Bowles had a major impact on Wake. It’s unclear but seems doubtful. And for those who still believe the Bucs should draft an edge rusher with the No. 19 pick, pray then that Bucs icon Lavonte David returns. David thought about retirement last year and who knows about this offseason? If David retires, and K.J. Britt, a free agent, signs elsewhere, the Bucs then would have no starting inside linebackers returning. That’s bad. And if that happens, Joe thinks it’s a damn good bet the Bucs draft a linebacker at No. 19. Joe isn’t an @ss enough to claim David will screw up the Bucs if he retires. But if he does, don’t the Bucs pretty much have to draft an inside linebacker at No. 19 if they don’t fill the holes in free agency? The free agency dinner bell rings four weeks from Wednesday. Two days prior, legal tampering kicks off. Illegal tampering ramps up in two weeks at the combine in Indianapolis.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/bakes-my-quarterback/|“Bake’s My Quarterback”|Was there much of a transition from Tom Brady to Baker Mayfield for then-Bucs All-Pro right tackle Tristan Wirfs? No, says Wirfs, or at least not much of one. Now Wirfs wasn’t crazy enough to say Mayfield was better. Even Mayfield wouldn’t go there. (Yes, Joe knows Rachaad White actually did go there.) However, often there is a transition for teams and teammates when changing quarterbacks. But Wirfs viewing Mayfield as one of the guys, which Brady really wasn’t, helped with transitioning from the best ever to a guy that had to win over the organization on a prove-it contract. Appearing with Ari Meirov of The33rdTeam, Wirfs explained the transition. “Yeah, I thought it went pretty smooth,” Wirfs said. “I mean, Baker came in and kind of just won everyone over, just with being who he is, you know? His personality is incredible. And he’s a baller. He’s a dawg. “It was really cool for me, you know. I mean, basically [Mayfield is] a little bit older me, but, like, somebody — Tom was 22 years older than me — so like having somebody my age and that I could hang out with, go to dinner with, just all that stuff. So I think that really, really helped us click off the bat. “But I thought it was a really smooth transition. You know Bake’s my quarterback. Ride and die with. So it’s pretty awesome. I love him to death.” Wirfs and Brady were tight as teammates, but Brady had a different life outside the Bucs locker room. Anyone remember how Wirfs, sidelined in Brady’s final Bucs season, came jogging out of the tunnel after Brady pulled off a last-second win and lifted Brady in the air and bear-hugged him on the field? And Brady has been effusive in his praise for Wirfs since leaving the Bucs. So the two were tight — as teammates. It was and is cool to see that Mayfield is just one of the guys, ready to hang out, pound beers, guzzle skinny margs, go fishing or soak in some sun on an island retreat.|2025-02-10 10:30:00|350|26|7|Tristan Wirfs|Smooth transition from Brady to Mayfield; Wirfs praises Mayfield.|6|Mixed sentiment towards Brady and new quarterback Baker with some appreciation for the team dynamic.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Allen Lofton"", ""post"": ""Being one of the guys is cool but it will take another good draft and a Guy like Sweat to top you over the top.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/we-believe-we-got-enough-talent/|“We Believe We Got Enough Talent”|Is it a move-all-in offseason for the Bucs? Joe hopes so. First, that would be fun. Second, it feels like a good time given the makeup of the roster and the weak NFC South. What really matters, though, is what Buccaneers Ring of Honor general manager Jason Licht believes and Team Glazer believe is right for the team. No slap at Todd Bowles, but head coaches always have a win-now mentality and are tough to trust when it comes to long-term thinking. Joe thinks the mindset of players has an interesting role. When a roster collectively believes it’s close to winning it all, it’s hard on players if the front office moves don’t match their belief. Rachaad White told something called SportsGrid last week that the team knows it’s ready to win now. “In the building, in the locker room and the guys, how we feel about it, yes, we believe we got enough talent [to win now,]” White said. “… Rooms, stats or positions, I think we match up with a lot of people very well.” Every Bucs player certainly knows the team beat the Super Bowl champion Eagles last season — and the Lions and Commancers. Is Licht ready to tackle free agency and the draft like a man inches from a Super Bowl? Joe can’t say. Ultimately, it is Licht’s job to be smart, crafty, creative and strike a balance between building short-term and long-term simultaneously.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/free-agency-countdown-28-days-josh-sweat-equity/|Free Agency Countdown: 28 Days — Josh Sweat Equity|The big board at JoeBucsFan.com has a big No. 28 on it. The countdown clock is a shade under 675 hours.  Exactly four weeks from today, at high noon on March 10, teams can negotiate with agents and reach agreements to sign players in free agency. Adam Schefter and friends will be reporting signings like Joe pounds Hooters wings on Super Bowl Sunday. Those reported deals can be made official on Wednesday, March 12. This year, the Bucs will have salary cap room and they can craft more by, for example, giving Mike Evans a contract extension and legitimately making him a “Buc For Life. Other current contracts can be worked as well. No, money won’t be a good excuse for the Bucs not signing a quality edge pass rusher this offseason. That brings Joe to an easy target to consider. Beastly Eagles edge rusher Josh Sweat is a pending free agent. The world watched him go wild on the Chiefs last night with 2 1/2 sacks and loads of pressure. Sweat, a 2018 fourth-round Eagles draft pick out of Florida State, had 8 sacks in the regular season. He turns 28 next month. He’s also a relatively low-mileage guy after not becoming a full-time starter until his fourth season, 2021, when he landed in the Pro Bowl. After a huge Super Bowl, it sure feels like Sweat will be overpriced in free agency. Maybe he’ll help drive the price down of other free agent edge rushers. Some sort of addition is coming to the Bucs’ edge rush. “Status woe” can’t be the approach. Can it?|2025-02-10 09:20:00|266|30|7|Josh Sweat|Bucs to target edge rusher in upcoming free agency.|4|Mixed sentiment with concerns about cap space, player performance, and potential defensive improvements.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Jeff"", ""post"": ""Glazer Boys too cheap to land a top flight edge rusher.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/josh-grizzard-cherishes-baker-mayfields-endorsement/|Josh Grizzard Cherishes Baker Mayfield’s Endorsement|Strong words on the Bucs’ starting quarterback from his new offensive coordinator. Josh Grizzard last week spoke glowingly of Baker Mayfield and was touched by the support Mayfield showed him and how Mayfield reached out after he learned of Grizzard’s promotion. And to hear Grizzard talk about Mayfield, it sounds like Grizzard wants to make Mayfield sort of a player-coach to help guide younger players. “It means the world to me,” Grizzard said of Mayfield’s support. “Without knowing him going into this time last year when I was brought on [and now] he was one of the first people to FaceTime me when I got the job. “I know I have the support of him. I was in every meeting with him last year, whether it was gameplan meetings, on the field, going through individual [work] with Thad [Lewis], Liam [Coen] and Jordan [Somerville]. So, to take our relationship to the next level and be able to lean on him and him take that next step as a leader [is huge after] being in the league this long. “Now he can shoulder more of the burden to elevate the younger guys and coach the younger guys. That way he is another extension of the coaching staff on the field. He has been fantastic. You know he is a competitor and we’re looking forward to it.” Joe thinks Mayfield certainly has some coach qualities. With all the offensive coordinators Mayfield has had in his day, from Kliff Kingsbury and Lincoln Riley down to Dave Canales, Liam Coen and perhaps Grizzard, you have to figure some wisdom from those offensive wizards has rubbed off. For a young guy, who better to get advice from than a quarterback who has been through and survived such an NFL roller coaster as Mayfield has? He’s navigated highs and lows and come out better for it. From No. 1 overall pick to the NFL trash heap to back-to-back Pro Bowls and division titles.|2025-02-10 07:00:00|327|10|9|Josh Grizzard|Mayfield endorses Grizzard as leader and player-coach.|6|Mixed sentiments with optimism for Baker Mayfield and defense concerns for the team.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""OHBucFan"", ""post"": ""With all of the talk about redemption for Hurts last night, just imagine if Baker has another year like these last two and the Bucs go deep in the playoffs.

Maybe if Joe is four glasses of Bulleit Bourbon Frontier Whiskey in on a Thanksgiving afternoon when the Eagles play the Cowboys would Joe ever pull for the Eagles. It just isn’t in Joe’s soul otherwise. The Eagles won the Super Bowl last night the old-fashioned way: alley-beating the Chiefs in the trenches. The Bucs aren’t far away from being monsters in the trenches like the Eagles. In fact, with the exception of one position, the Bucs are right there. The Bucs have a top-five offensive line and it’s still young. The entire right side of the Bucs’ line (Graham Barton, Cody Mauch and Luke Goedeke) is under rookie contracts. The Bucs have one of the better one-two punches at defensive tackle in Vita Vea and Calijah Kancey. Even Logan Hall has become a solid player. Not a fancy player. Doesn’t rack up stats. But he holds his own quite well. So the Bucs are in good shape for January (and February?) football. They have the run game. They have the offensive line. And the Bucs mostly have the defensive line. Find a guy off the edge who quarterbacks fear and the Bucs are cooking with gas. The future could be very bright, folks. The Bucs mostly have the needed parts for a Super Bowl bandwagon — just have to get that one final piece to the puzzle.

And Joe thought it sure looked familiar to last night. The Bucs pounded the Chiefs in a good ol’ football wood-shedding. The Bucs’ defensive line, specifically edge rushers — who knew? — beat the snot out of Pat Mahomes that night. Jason Pierre-Paul, Shaq Barrett, Ndamukong Suh and Vita Vea went wilding, chasing Mahomes seemingly back and forth from The Licht House to Bradenton and back. As a result, the Bucs stomped the Chiefs. Last night in the Eagles’ 42-22 seal-clubbing of the Chiefs, the first half looked a lot like the Bucs-Chiefs of four years ago.. The Bucs, like the Eagles, have a damn good corps of players in the trenches. There is one piece to the missing puzzle in Joe’s mind. And you know what that is. And Joe is confident those reading this here corners of the interwebs know the next two words Joe has typed. “Edge rush!” Please, Bucs. Please find an edge rusher. A proven, consistent edge rusher. And preferably not one who quits on the team shortly after signing a contract.|2025-02-10 00:00:00|194|31|5|Eagles|Eagles mimic Bucs' Super Bowl win with strong defensive play.|5|Mixed sentiments on free agents and team performance, focus on improving defense with edge rusher.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Dew"", ""post"": ""Josh Sweat may become a FA.
