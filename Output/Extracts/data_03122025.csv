https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/ben-bredeson-sees-no-obstacle-in-taking-offense-to-another-level/|Ben Bredeson Sees No Obstacle In Taking Offense To Another Level|Last year the Bucs ranked third in average yards per game at 400 yards (399.6 to be precise). Pretty impressive. But not impressive enough for Ben Bredeson? The Tampa Bay left guard, seeing the Bucs will return all 11 starters from that same offense (provided Chris Godwin is healthy), can envision the offense taking a step forward. “Personally, it’s something I’ve never experienced – having the entire offensive line return let alone the entire offense return,” Bredeson said yesterday. “It’s very exciting. We’re going to have to build this thing back up again – it’s not just going to pick up right where we left off. “We have to build this back up through OTA’s and training camp. With that continuity between the running backs, O-line, [wide] receivers, quarterback, we can really make some strides and hopefully streamline that growing process a little bit faster.” This sounds great and Joe’s not trying to throw cold water on the idea. But remember that new Bucs offensive coordinator Josh Grizzard has never called plays before. Yeah, Joe gets it, he was on Liam Coen’s staff last year. That alone should help Grizzard quite a bit. He knows what and who he’s working with, knows each player’s strengths and weaknesses. Still, Joe thinks that’s putting a lot of undue pressure on a first-time offensive coordinator. It seems unreasonable for Grizzard to guide the Bucs’ offense to a top-two unit. Could the offense be that good? Sure. Remember, the Bucs had three rookie starters last season. Just having experience in the NFL, all three (Bucky Irving, Graham Barton and Jalen McMillan) should be better. If Grizzard does get the offense to improve, it’s a safe bet head coach Todd Bowles will once again be looking for another offensive coordinator next winter.|2025-03-12 23:00:00|297|19|8|Ben Bredeson|Bredeson excited about offense's potential for improvement with returning starters.|4|Mixed opinions on Grizzard's potential with mentions of concerns and optimism.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Delusional Intelligence"", ""post"": "" If Grizzard does get the offense to improve, it\u2019s a safe bet head coach Todd Bowles will once again be looking for another offensive coordinator next winter.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/his-rightful-destination/|“His Rightful Destination”|Rondé Barber stopped short of saying a mistake was made. The iconic Bucs cornerback visited The Jay Recher Podcast and was asked about his old ball coach, Jon Gruden, being reinstated into the Buccaneers Ring of Honor. The announcement came last month, as Team Glazer changed course on a decision made about 3 1/2 years ago to kick Chucky out of the Ring of Honor for email crimes against decency that included naughty comments about Roger Goodell and a Glazer. Barber feels a wrong was righted. “The initial reaction was one that I think kind of shocked a lot of people. We all know Jon, and he’s not what people portrayed him to be,” Barber said. “So I think the Glazers have done a great job here, you know, re-engaging with him. The business side of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers [is] doing a great job getting him back involved in the things that happen at One Buc Place. And having him back in the Ring of Honor feels like his rightful destination.” Barber went on to laud Gruden, noting “he changed the course of this franchise.” Joe’s been asked a few times about whether Gruden will have another ceremony to go back in the Ring. Joe highly doubts that would happen. It would make little sense and likely be embarrassing. Joe suspects Chucky’s name will re-appear for the first preseason game in August.|2025-03-12 22:32:00|233|26|8|Rondé Barber|Gruden's reinstatement in Buccaneers Ring of Honor praised by players.|2|Mixed sentiments with criticism towards Gruden, appreciation for Dungy, and some support for Gruden.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Erik w/ Pilot & Driver.\u2122 Experience the Art of Motion.\u2122"", ""post"": ""I definitely love that Gruden and the Bucs seem to be burying the hatchet on all fronts\u2026"", ""post_time"": [""Erik"", ""w/"", ""Pilot"", ""&"", ""Driver.\u2122"", ""Experience"", ""the"", ""Art"", ""of"", ""Motion.\u2122""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""View from 132"", ""post"": ""Gruden put one of the best Bucs teams on the field, followed by years of inept management of players.

Maybe Bucs backup quarterback Kyle Trask doesn’t like fighting with America’s Quarterback, Jameis Winston, for a gig, likely playing somewhere cold. Or perhaps Trask has been burned too often by resort fees and, as a result, he’s turned off from playing for his former teammate Tom Brady in Las Vegas. Whatever the reason, the former Gators star quarterback is staying in the free state of Florida. Per Jenna Laine of ESPN, Trask will continue to be Baker Mayfield’s safety net. It’s a one-year deal, Laine typed. Various reports say Trask will earn $2.7 million. Trask is a good guy and in the very few brief snaps he’s played, he didn’t embarrass himself. If he’s going to be a backup, may as well do so in Florida where there’s no state income tax and he won’t freeze on the sidelines.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/haason-reddick-versus-leonard-floyd/|Haason Reddick Versus Leonard Floyd|So the Falcons attacked their anemic pass rush in free agency by cutting Grady Jarrett (LOL) and adding edge rusher Leonard Floyd on a one-year deal for $10 million this week. Joe finds that kind of fun because the Bucs also needed edge rush help and signed Haason Reddick at one-year, $14 million. Floyd turns 33 in September and had 8 1/2 sacks last season for the 49ers. The year before, Floyd had 10 1/2 sacks for Buffalo. Prior to that, he had 9 or more sacks for three consecutive seasons with the Rams. See a pattern? That’s five years of production. It also came for teams with strong interior pass rushes that were willing to part ways with Floyd. Reddick turns 31 in September (two years younger than Floyd) and he’s a two-time Pro Bowler (2022 and 2023 seasons). He also had beastly production for three teams (Cardinals, Panthers and Eagles), but he’s had better seasons than Floyd. Of course, last year Reddick had a case of poor judgment/meltdown/tantrum after being traded to the Jets. He held out until mid-October. And then he looked like a player that held out until mid-October on a crappy team. But Joe and fellow Bucs fans will pretend last season didn’t happen. It was the Jets, after all, the same team that hasn’t had a winning season since Todd Bowles went 10-6 there in 2015. So was Floyd a better signing than Reddick? Were both a better choice than banged up Joey Bosa, 30, who’s also getting a one-year deal for $12.6 million from the Bills? Speaking of the Bills, why didn’t they want Floyd back? Joe can’t wait to see how this plays out — and to laugh at the Falcons for another year.|2025-03-12 15:27:00|292|30|3|Haason Reddick vs Leonard Floyd|Edge rusher signings and comparisons.|5|Mixed sentiments with some positivity and excitement, along with skepticism and speculations.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""AK"", ""post"": ""Atlanta fans/media likely will spin the release of Jarrett as being \u201cneeded to get younger\u201d\u2026 but, if they weren\u2019t dealing with the ramifications of Kirk Cousins, my guess is they don\u2019t release him.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/lavonte-david-talks-longevity/|Lavonte David Talks Longevity|Bucs icon Lavonte David admitted it. What he’s doing with the Bucs is beyond his childhood dreams. Appearing on NFL Network today, David spoke of his long career and what keeps him sharp. First, of course, is a love of the game. Second is pride in being a well-rounded player. Being flexible, David believes, is a reason why he’s had so much success, even when the Bucs were not successful. “It’s just adapting and adjusting,” David said. “I’ve been through many head coaches. I’ve been through many defenses. For me, all I try to do is adapt and adjust to make [the type of defense] work to my benefit, on my behalf.” When David agreed to return to the Bucs last week, it marked the start of his 14th season. David never believed he would be in the NFL this long. And it seems he hasn’t lost his passion. “Since I started playing football, I never thought I would be in this position,” David said. “It’s starting to feel surreal. … “To be up there [for years only playing with the Bucs] with Rondé [Barber] and Derrick Brooks, to play for this organization for a long time, is really incredible. … “Going into my 14th season, it’s kind of crazy to say. I love it. I’m going to enjoy it.” Joe is repetitive this time of the year when David comes back to the Bucs, but, once again, we should cherish every game in which David puts on a Bucs helmet and buckles up his chin strap. He might only have a handful of games left.|2025-03-12 13:44:00|266|21|10|Lavonte David|David's long NFL career is beyond childhood dreams.|8|Fans are optimistic about the team, supportive of veteran players, and excited for future success.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""gbobucsfan"", ""post"": ""LVD and ME13\u2019s last dance?"", ""post_time"": [""March"", ""12th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""2:58"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""miken"", ""post"": ""I\u2019d like one more SB run for #13 and #54\u2026 they are both deserving of the Hall of fame on the FIRST ballot!"", ""post_time"": [""March"", ""12th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""2:59"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""SlyPirate"", ""post"": ""RECORDS GALLORE Exciting year for LVD Fans.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/greg-gaines-returns-as-defensive-tackle/|Greg Gaines Returns As Defensive Tackle|Jason Licht is keeping the band together. The four-time NFC South champs are sticking together. Bucs AC/DC-loving general manager Jason Licht is seeing to that. This morning as left guard Ben Bredeson was speaking to the local pen and mic club via Zoom about his return, another trench warrior decided to stay put. Defensive tackle Greg Gaines is coming back for $3.5 million, per Jordan Schultz of FOX Sports. It’s a one-year deal. Joe finds it funny that all the caterwauling about the Philly Tush Push, it is the Bucs who have had a lot of success against it. Part of that is Gaines is a beefy tackle who is very difficult to move.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/ben-bredeson-doesnt-see-why-bucs-offensive-line-cannot-improve/|Ben Bredeson Believes Bucs’ Offensive Line Can Improve|Last year the Bucs not only had two new starters on the offensive line, it also had a new position coach, Kevin Carberry. Who knew a year ago that the Bucs would grow into one of the better offensive lines in the game? Now their bringing everyone back, having a year of experience and rookie center Graham Barton no longer a rookie, maybe the line could be better? That’s what Ben Bredeson believes. The Bucs’ left guard agreed to terms to return. One big reason is he believes line hasn’t maxed out yet. “It took some gelling,” Bredeson said of learning the ropes with the Bucs last year, with a rookie starting to his right. “Obviously, that’s what the whole training camp is for, OTAs, all that. “But once we started to find our rhythm, we started clicking pretty well.” The Michigan Man (all his brothers played either football or baseball for the Wolverines), a native of Wisconsin,spent three seasons before coming to the Bucs with a garbage organization, the Giants. Getting a taste of stability and winning in 2024, Bredeson didn’t seem to be in a rush to leave. “The group down here, not just the o-line or the team, the front office, organization in general, is just outstanding,” Bredeson said. “I absolutely love it. So I was thrilled to be back.” Joe is of the mind that yes, barring injuries, the Bucs’ offensive line could be better. Guys were learning each other this time last year, not just Bredeson and Barton finding their footing, but getting used to Bucky Irving’s running style as well. Now that everyone is starting the offseason on the same page, why couldn’t this line dominate again?|2025-03-12 09:24:00|283|25|9|Ben Bredeson|Bucs' offensive line poised for improvement.|5|Mixed sentiments about team performance, varying from optimism to criticism but with some historical context.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Baking with Grizz"", ""post"": ""The Dream Decade continues\u2026."", ""post_time"": [""March"", ""12th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""10:32"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Baking with Grizz"", ""post"": ""LFG!!!!"", ""post_time"": [""March"", ""12th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""10:34"", ""am""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""Lord Cornelius"", ""post"": ""We should expect improvement."", ""post_time"": [""March"", ""12th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""10:39"", ""am""]}, ""commenter3"": {""username"": ""Allen Lofton"", ""post"": ""Looks exciting"", ""post_time"": [""March"", ""12th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""10:51"", ""am""]}, ""commenter4"": {""username"": ""Teacherman"", ""post"": ""Be smart.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/chris-godwin-raves-about-jalen-mcmillan/|Chris Godwin Raves About Jalen McMillan|Mike Evans is a big fan of Bucs receiver Jalen McMillan. And Chris Godwin explained why he is, too. Yesterday at One Buc Palace, Joe was among the assembled liking how cool it was the way Godwin detailed why he has high hopes for McMillan, now entering his second year in Tampa. “The way that he turned it on at the end of the season, it was amazing,” Godwin said. “It was crazy to see. I feel like I’ve never seen anybody have so many wide-open touchdowns. It was unreal to see his growth from the beginning of the season to the end, and his level of comfort. It was very cool. “I’m extremely excited about his future, about what he can turn into, because he’s really a great kid. I say kid like I’m old, I’m 29 years old, what am I talking about? “He’s a great guy. It’s funny, when he got here, one of the first things he said to me was, ‘I can’t believe I’m on a team with Chris Godwin.’ I was like, ‘What are you talking about? I feel like I just got here.’ I’m a kid just like him.” McMillan was constantly peppering Godwin with questions, Godwin said, addding he was only happy to help out. “I’m happy to give advice,” Godwin said. “To see him be able to bloom the way he did at the end of the year, it really makes me excited for the contributions that he can give this upcoming season.” If Godwin is not ready to rock by Week 1, he said McMillan is one reason why he won’t be concerned about the offense. After catching a touchdown pass in his first game with the Bucs, Week 1 against Washington, McMillan sort of went into hiding. He emerged with a bang. Beginning in Week 14 in a 28-13 Bucs win over Las Vegas, McMillan had a pair of touchdown catches. He then had at least one touchdown catch in every game the rest of the regular season. If McMillan can keep up that crazy pace, he’d be a lock to become a Pro Bowler, just like Godwin.|2025-03-12 07:50:00|359|22|8|Chris Godwin|Godwin praises McMillan|5|Mixed sentiment on JMAC and Trey Palmer, with concerns about physicality and potential for success.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Baker Bowl"", ""post"": ""Loved JMAC coming out (we got the best Washington receiver, and took him after the other 2), still really want to see Trey Palmer get his time, hopefully he can break a couple plays open in the preseason like Victor Cruz a while back.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/almost-entire-offense-returns/|Almost Entire Offense Returns|Four years ago the Bucs decided to run it back. And it nearly worked. Bucs AC/DC-loving general manager Jason Licht pulled off the near impossible, keeping the 2020 Super Bowl champs intact, returning 22+1 starters. If not for injuries, both physical and mental, the Bucs probably run it back to repeat as champs. Last year, the Bucs were only champs of the NFC South. But with all the drama involved with the Liam Coen fiasco, Licht again wanted to at least keep the offense, one of the league’s best, together. Licht has done that with the exception of Coen. All 11 offensive starters return, including new offensive coordinator Josh Grizzard as Coen’s replacement and offensive line coach Kevin Carberry, who did an excellent job last season, and other assistants. Licht said yesterday at One Buc Palace this was his goal: To try to bring everyone back on offense, players and assistant coaches. “It’s very exciting to have everybody back,” Licht said. “Even though we still have a lot of offseason to go – the draft – there’s a lot of time before the season starts to make some additions, too. “That was very important to all of us, to have some continuity, starting with Todd [Bowles] hiring Josh [Grizzard] and us keeping our coaches – the offensive line coaches, everybody, [wide] receivers coach, I could name them all. “We’re so lucky to have all of them. We’re very excited about that.” If Grizzard can keep the core focus of Coen’s offense and philosophy the same (we all know there will be new wrinkles) this offense could actually be better than last year’s. Think about it: Graham Barton will be a year smarter. Same with Bucky Irving, who was not a starter early last season. Jalen McMillan, too, has a full year in the NFL under his belt. And he ended the 2024 season on a hot streak. Joe hates to put a ton of pressure on a first-year playcaller in Grizzard, but the talent is there to improve.|2025-03-12 06:00:00|338|25|8|Almost Entire Offense Returns|Bucs keep offensive core intact for potential improvement.|3|Mixed feelings about offense and defense, tempered excitement, uncertainty about offseason moves.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Lt.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/chris-godwin-ill-be-back/|Chris Godwin: I’ll Be Back|Joe remembers two weeks ago at the combine in Indianapolis where Bucs types pretty much all agreed that if any player could bounce back from an awful injury like a dislocated ankle, it would be Chris Godwin. And Godwin yesterday at One Buc Palace oozed that confidence, all but promising a full return. Godwin refused to elaborate on his injury or his rehab. Wouldn’t even put a timeline on a return, only to say he was good with where he was in the rehab. Godwin did say one reason he didn’t want to offer a date is that it would be empty. If his rehab is lagging and he tries to push it too hard to meet that day, it all could blow up in his face and actually set him back. Obviously, Godwin wants to avoid that. Taking the rehab at its own pace is possible, Godwin said, because of the talent the Bucs have on offense. “I think the beautiful thing is the way this team is set up,” Godwin said. “We have a ton of playmakers all over the field and I think we had a really good view of that when I got hurt, when Mike [Evans] got hurt and we were still one of the best offenses in the league. “To me, I look at that as there’s a world of opportunities out there and not just for myself but for all of us. When we’re all healthy, we’re going to be a hell of an offense to try to deal with and that excites me.” If Mike Evans can avoid his seemingly annual hamstring issues until Godwin gets back, that will be a plus. Bucky Irving and Cade Otton and Jalen McMillan and Evans can carry the Bucs until Godwin gets the green light. If new Bucs offensive coordinator Josh Grizzard can keep the Bucs offense in the top 10 — Joe doesn’t want to put unreasonable expectations on a first-year coordinator — until Godwin returns, look out NFC South.|2025-03-12 02:45:00|336|19|7|Chris Godwin|Confident about return from injury with strong team support.|8|Mixed sentiment with optimistic views on Godwin's recovery and some concerns about his timeline.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Leopold Stotch"", ""post"": ""Look out NFC South?
