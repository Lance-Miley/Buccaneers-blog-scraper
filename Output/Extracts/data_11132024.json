While Goedeke missed four games with a concussion, Bowles said his time on the field shows that he’s one of the very best right tackles in football.On defense, Bowles went with his prized rookie pupil Tykee Smith, the third-round draft pick.Smith doesn’t just get a most-improved nod from Bowles. It sounds like Bowles sees Smith as his defensive MVP.“Tykee Smith has probably had the best season over there [on defense] so far,” Bowles said. “And he’s had a heck of a year for us. And he sets the edge. He gets the ball out. He causes turnovers. He’s a very good tackler for us and he’s a very heady football player.”It’s always exciting when second-day draft picks rise up and become top-flight players. Goedeke, a 2022 second-round pick, was strong as a starter last year but Bowles said he’s shown significant improvement and is very “unsung.”", "post_time": "2024-11-13T19:22:47+00:00", "word_count": 210, "number_of_comments": 23, "article_sentiment_score": "8", "article_subject": "Todd Bowles", "article_summary": "Bowles names Goedeke and Smith as most improved players.", "responses": {"commenter0": {"username": "Bucben1961", "post": "This is like my bald headed self telling you my 2 favorite hair conditioners", "post_time": "November 13th, 2024 at 2:25 pm"}, "commenter1": {"username": "Dave Pear", "post": "No worries.

Certainly, he could take the top off the defense. For whatever reason, he and Baker Mayfield didn’t seem to have their timing sharpened.And, of course, Palmer needed to work on his hands.In the playoff win over the Eagles, Palmer showed he was much more than a go-route receiver. He caught a short pass on the right side at midfield, made one Eagles defender miss, and Palmer was off to the races for a long touchdown, weaving through the defense using his speed to make defenders eat his cinders.This year? Palmer has been just slightly better than a rumor.This has been odd to Joe because Joe had an offensive coach tell him in training camp the team hoped to use Palmer more in the short passing game, letting his wheels take over to rack up explosive plays (see: playoff win over the Eagles).This year through 10 games, Palmer has nine catches. At this point last year as a rookie in heavy run-oriented offense, Palmer had 21 catches.It seems Palmer, for reasons unclear, has fallen out of favor with coaches. Consider what Todd Bowles said about the receivers earlier this week and how the offense has changed in the wake of the injuries to Mike Evans and Chris Godwin.“Any time you lose two All-Pros and you have a guy that’s playing for the first time, really – ‘Shep’ (Sterling Shepard) has played in this league but it’s his first time in the system – ‘J-Mac’ (Jalen McMillan) is a rookie, Trey [Palmer] is [in his] second year, you have Ryan [Miller] coming off the practice squad, so there [are] going to be some chemistry things,” Bowles said.Notice Bowles only mentioned Palmer right before he recited a practice squad dude’s name out of courtesy.Palmer entered the season as sort of WR3a or WR3b, depending on the direction of the breeze. Now? Joe isn’t sure Palmer is WR5. Miller has had more targets (11) the past three weeks than Palmer (7).Through the first 10 games last season, the fewest snaps Palmer played in a game was 23 in the season-opener.This year? In only two of the first 10 games has Palmer logged more than 27 snaps.It’s a mystery. Palmer is really the lone guy on the roster that can stretch the field.So with Evans and Godwin out and Palmer reduced to part-time status, no wonder the Bucs are throwing short so much. There’s no need for a defense to concern themselves with the long ball.", "post_time": "2024-11-13T17:30:34+00:00", "word_count": 442, "number_of_comments": 41, "article_sentiment_score": "3", "article_subject": "Trey Palmer", "article_summary": "Fall from potential star to underutilized receiver.", "responses": {"commenter0": {"username": "Baker Bowl", "post": "It is really interesting, and honestly I have no idea either.

That meant there is roughly a 50/50 shot the Bucs play a game next season outside the United States.If there are eight games, that means 16 teams likely will be involved. In other words, half the league.Per Albert Breer of SI.com, the league has a plan, approved by NFL owners, that each team will play an international game every other year. And, each team will be required to give up a home game to host an international game once every four years.Breer typed that’s why Goodell is eyeing eight foreign games in 2025.NFL owners have already agreed to a model that’ll compel each of them to give up a home game every four years, and play internationally every other year. The eight-game setup allows for that, where 16 teams go each year.Given the Bucs are one of a handful of teams with marketing rights in Germany, and that the Bucs recently opened up a bar on Marienplatz in Munich called “Krewe Embassy” (sponsored by Killian’s if you can imagine!), the chances the Bucs return to Munich seem good.Goodell last week from Munich (where the NFL attempted to wreck decades of strong relations between Germany and the United States by assaulting the locals with the Giants-Stinking Panthers game) was asked about rumors of the NFL playing in Berlin next year. Goodell responded, “Believe them.”Berlin city government this week voted to make a putsch push to host an NFL game for the next five years.
