https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/mike-edwards-and-round-3-in-tampa/|Mike Edwards And Round 3 In Tampa|Todd Bowles was pounding a drum for ballhawks last week in Indianapolis. In the modern era of Bucs football, when Joe thinks “ballhawks,” Joe thinks of a guy invited back to the Bucs roster in November. That’s Bucs 2019 third-round draft pick Mike Edwards, the versatile safety/nickel cornerback. In 30 career regular season starts, Edwards has 8 interceptions. In postseason play, Edwards has another 3 picks, including one for the Chiefs in January of 2024. Jamel Dean? He’s more than doubled Edwards’ career starts and doesn’t have nearly the ballhawk production. So Joe is thinking Edwards, a pending free agent, is a guy the Bucs want to invite back for a third go-round in Tampa. He turns 29 in May and has low mileage on his body, and Joe doesn’t know of a major injury in his history. Edwards’ time off in 2021? That was tied to getting busted for a phony vaccine card. Remember, Bowles himself said Edwards changed the Bucs defense (in a good way) before he got hurt late last season. Edwards will come very cheap and Bowles seems to love bringing back players that know his defense. This almost seems like a no-brainer move for the Bucs — to let Edwards compete for a job.|2025-03-03 17:29:00|209|29|8|Mike Edwards|Edwards likely welcomed back by Bucs with impressive ballhawk stats.|2|Mixed sentiments with some optimism regarding retaining certain players, concerns about defensive performance.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Dew"", ""post"": ""Is there a list of Bucs Free Agents?

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/critical-2025-lab-work-at-bucs-headquarters/|Critical 2025 “Lab” Work At Bucs Headquarters|Once upon a time at One Buc Palace, Jon Gruden had a laboratory where he worked on hidden talents. Per the words of Buccaneers Ring of Honor general manager Jason Licht, it sounds like Todd Bowles has maintained the Bunsen burners and sterilized the old beakers and test tubes. Bowles has been busy in the lab, Licht told NFL Daily last week. The Bucs’ head coach has said publicly that he likes to bring major tweaks to his defense every two or three years because offensive coordinators will figure out a defense without those changes. Makeover season has arrived, per Licht.  Joe hopes Kirk “I’m only great against the Bucs” Cousins had something to do with it. “Todd’s always, every few years, completely does a makeover and changes a lot of the things he does defensively to keep it fresh,” Licht said. “I know he’s been in the lab lately doing some things to make things a little bit different this year. But it all depends on the personnel that you have, so we have to help as much as we can there.” Bowles arrived in Tampa with Bucco Bruce Arians in 2019. And given the Bucs’ success, it’s obvious Bowles didn’t do much to change the defense through the 2021 season. So perhaps he brought behind-the-scenes change in 2022. And if he’s following a three-year plan, then it makes sense that this is an offseason of defensive overhaul. What that looks like and what different kinds of players he needs to execute it is a mystery.|2025-03-03 09:53:00|257|24|7|Todd Bowles|Defensive makeover at Bucs headquarters in 2025.|3|Mixed sentiments on defense changes, hope for improvement, concern about past failures and aging players.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""JimBobBuc"", ""post"": ""Bowles in the lab creating a Frankenstein defense?

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/doesnt-sound-as-if-bucky-irving-will-be-a-bellcow/|Doesn’t Sound Like Bucky Irving Will Be A One-Man Running Attack|Todd Bowles had an interesting comment at the combine in Indianapolis last week. It may have been a window into the Bucs’ rushing attack this fall. Bucky Irving set the NFL on fire last year. He sparked a new cry regularly heard at The Licht House during home games. “Buh-KEY… Buh-KEY… Buh-KEY… “ The Bucs’ running back tore up defenses and had one of the better rookie seasons on record for a running back — 1,122 yards and 8 touchdowns on only 207 carries. He was simply electric. But does that mean Bucky is going to get the ball 25-30 times a game? Bowles sure didn’t suggest that. In fact, it sounded more like he wants Bucky to share the load. “I still think it’s a two-headed attack in this league nowadays,” Bowles said. “One person really doesn’t get all the carries.” Now Bowles did say Bucky was a “bellcow” but in the next sentence noted he is just part of the Bucs’ running attack. “I thought [Bucky came along] a great deal, and we haven’t had a real running game here in like six years,” Bowles said. “So with Bucky coming in along with Rachaad [White] and they had a one-two punch, I thought they were very effective.” No, Bowles didn’t mention Sean Tucker. Joe thinks is if Bucky is hot and he’s tearing off chunks of yards at a time, he could get 15-20 carries a game. Otherwise, Joe thinks the Bucs want to save wear and tear on Bucky and have Rachaad White and Tucker carry the mail some so Bucky isn’t banged up come the playoffs.|2025-03-03 09:30:00|270|42|7|Bucky Irving|Bucs aim for balanced running attack with multiple backs.|4|Mixed opinions on running backs' roles, potential trades, and team strategy for the upcoming season.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Erik with Pilot and Driver\u2122"", ""post"": ""The only frustrating thing about this is that Sean Tucker is potentially our best RB due to his elite skillset."", ""post_time"": [""Erik"", ""with"", ""Pilot"", ""and"", ""Driver\u2122""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""ATLBucSolar"", ""post"": ""One of the things I did not like about Liam\u2019s offense is the lack of deep shots.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/im-not-blind/|“I’m Not Blind”|Fans and Joe saw it. So did Buccaneers Ring of Honor general manager Jason Licht. The Bucs didn’t have enough juice to stop Jayden Daniels in the playoffs last season. “You see where we were lacking and I’m not blind — where we needed some help, particularly on one side of the ball,” Licht told NFL Daily host Greg Rosenthal, formerly of NFL.com. Yes, the Bucs are hunting this offseason to upgrade and repair their leaky 2024 defense. Licht said he’s acutely aware of the perils of wild free agency spending to fix issues, but he’s also quit saying he’s shopping exclusively at the Dollar Store, a one-liner he dropped two years ago. However the Bucs proceed next, Licht said he’s uplifted by how the post-Tom Brady era has proven his front office and coaching staff has the right stuff. He talked to Rosenthal about how the Bucs were forced to rely on rookies and undrafted rookies and the process “showed us that we have a great foundation.” Licht added: “The answer isn’t always throwing a lot of cash and buying expensive free agents. We found there’s other ways you can do it.”|2025-03-03 08:30:00|193|30|6|Jason Licht|Bucs upgrading defense|7|Fans show mixed optimism about team performance, trust in management, concerns about certain players.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""HC Grover"", ""post"": ""We need players so good that even Bowles can\u2019t mess it up."", ""post_time"": [""March"", ""3rd,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""8:45"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Bucnjim"", ""post"": ""Licht has just recently been getting the credit he deserves for being a great GM.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/jason-licht-success-of-rookies-a-two-pronged-approach/|Jason Licht: Success Of Rookies A Two-Pronged Approach|Last year the Bucs drafted seven rookies. Of those, five had an impact in at least one win. Often, they had major positive impacts. The only two guys the Bucs are waiting on to do something from that class is outside linebacker Chris Braswell and guard Elijah Klein. Braswell had a grand total of 1.5 sacks last year, though Joe isn’t going to kvetch when a rookie edge rusher doesn’t make a dent in the lineup. Klein had nine snaps on offense. The Bucs had one of the better offensive lines in the league last year so he’s behind a logjam. Last week at the combine in Indianapolis, Buccaneers general manager Jason Licht noted that having such a strong draft class was the result of two things: his personnel staff identifying the players and the rookies being coached up. “It was outstanding,” Licht said of the development of the 2024 rookies. “My staff and the coaches, they hit it out of the park. We’re looking forward to riding the coat tails and doing it again this year, hopefully. “It’s not every year you do that. You strive for it, but it’s going to go down, when it’s all said and done, when I’m sitting on a beach somewhere retired, I’ll think about this class and how excited I was about it.” Joe will guess Braswell will have ample chances to earn more playing time if not start this year — and if he performs, Licht would enjoy those cold beers on the beach even more. Licht and Bowles have been on a tear the past two seasons. Consider only two players from the 2023 draft class have yet to make their marks in the NFL: Josh Hayes and Jose Ramirez (who?). Hayes might be an OK special teams player but if he’s on the field as a cornerback, that’s not ideal. Ramirez had a lot of hype coming in (especially for a seventh-round pick) but so far the only noise he’s made is sparking a hassle with scrub Stinking Panthers linebacker Sam Franklin. Still, that’s a helluva batting average, only missing (so far) on 4 out of 15 draft picks is incredible. Nailing a third draft in a row seems to be too much to hope for, doesn’t it?|2025-03-03 07:00:00|379|13|6|Jason Licht|Bucs rookies show promising impact in recent NFL draft.|6|Mixed sentiment on draft success, player potential, coaching, and team future.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""It\u2019s brutal out here"", ""post"": ""We are unlikely to have that kind of success this draft because we don\u2019t have the defensive coaches and leadership needed to enable the players to reach their potential.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/hes-got-to-stop-thinking-so-much/|“He’s Got To Stop Thinking So Much”|As Bucs coach Todd Bowles met with a gaggle of Tampa Bay pen and mic club members last week at the combine in Indianapolis, when Bowles spoke about rookie outside linebacker Chris Braswell, Joe couldn’t help but think of a pop culture icon from the past. Joe kept thinking of Curly Howard of The Three Stooges and one of his famous lines, “I’m trying to think, but nothing happens.” (Insert sound effect of Curly getting his face slapped.) So why did Bowles’ words make Joe think of Curly? Because Bowles suggested Braswell embodied Curly’s line about thinking; Braswell was doing too much thinking and not enough playing. “He’s got to stop thinking so much,” Bowles said. “When he thinks he slows down. When he’s sure, he plays with his hair on fire and you can see how fast and physical he is. “When he’s not sure he thinks about it and he’s half-speed. We have to get him past that.” “I’m trying to think, but nothing happens.” Bowles did admit that Braswell was beginning to demonstrate why he was a second-round pick late in the season with his speed and physicality. Well, the numbers don’t bear out that it began clicking for Braswell late, though Joe is looking at production from an edge rusher and not his ability/inability to cover wide receivers. In Braswell’s last nine games, he had two quarterback hits and one sack. That’s about as invisible as an edge rusher can be without putting up Ghost Johnson-like goose eggs. And it’s not like Braswell had a log jam in front of him for playing time. The Bucs were so desperate for production at that position they pulled Bucs sacks king Shaq Barrett out of mothballs. Look, Joe is not going to rag on a rookie edge rusher. It’s very common for them to struggle. Still, Joe would like to see Braswell breathe on a quarterback more than he did last year, especially down the stretch. If it means not thinking is the answer, by all means channel Curly.  |2025-03-03 03:45:00|341|28|2|Chris Braswell|Coach criticizes overthinking rookie edge rusher's lack of production.|3|Mixed sentiment about defense scheme, pass rush, rookies with some optimism and frustration expressed.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""An Erection for Sacks"", ""post"": ""That is not the look of a confident man."", ""post_time"": [""March"", ""3rd,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""4:12"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Aqualung"", ""post"": ""The guilty plea on the indictment of overly complex defense has been submitted.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/bucs-continue-to-work-on-a-chris-godwin-deal/|Bucs “Continue To Work” On A Chris Godwin Deal|Before the combine started last week, the Bucs got a two-week extension to get a deal done with wide receiver Chris Godwin that pushed the deadline to sign him and avoid a massive cap hit to March 12. That just so happens to be the very same day that the free agency dinner bell sounds. So the reporting yesterday by Dan Graziano of BSPN adds up — the Bucs “continue to work” to get Godwin signed, the long-time BSPN insider typed. … It’s unclear at this point whether they can reach an agreement, but the hallmark of Tampa Bay’s 2024 free agency was its ability to retain its own, including Mike Evans and Baker Mayfield — so they’re optimistic about their chances of reaching a deal with Godwin. Yes, the Bucs are optimistic. What is less known is how optimistic the Bucs are that they won’t be signing damaged goods. Joe did not like the vibe Joe was getting from Bucs AC/DC-loving general manager Jason Licht and Todd Bowles last week in Indianapolis. Both raved about Godwin the person and the player. Both were eager to have Godwin back. Both seemed hesitant and/or depressed when discussing his surgically-repaired ankle. And that’s the issue right there. Do the Bucs sign Godwin to, say, an $18 million annual deal without fully knowing if or how well he can run routes and evade defenders? Can the Bucs sign Godwin to an incentive-laden contract that provides the Bucs a safety net? Would Godwin’s camp even agree to such a contract? What other teams are out there that are so desperate for a wide receiver they’d risk paying Godwin big money even if he’s damaged goods? Lot of things for the Bucs to sort through in the next nine days.
