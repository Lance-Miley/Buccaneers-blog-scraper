https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/josh-grizzard-wants-bucs-offense-to-evolve/|Josh Grizzard Wants Bucs Offense To Evolve|A word Joe does not like is one that has been thrown out there a lot in the wake of Liam Coen bolting to Jacksonville and the Bucs tapping Josh Grizzard as the new Bucs offensive coordinator. “Continuity.” Joe doesn’t like that word at all. Being stuck in the same rut allows other teams to catch up with what you are doing. How is that good? NFL teams should grow or look to grow week by week, not just in the offseason. So Joe saw the word “continuity” tossed around and got very uncomfortable. Thursday when Grizzard stood before the local pen and mic club at One Buc Palace, he embraced the word “continuity.” However, he added, don’t get that confused with stagnation. “The continuity will remain essentially the same,” Grizzard said. “What you want to do, like we did last year, is morph it to the players. You can morph after the draft, like it was last year, or in season based on who is hurt or who is not. “But we want to keep the root of that the same because that takes as much time as anything. With that said, I do think you have to evolve every year because now there is a full season of tape on what we did here and now people are studying that.” One way to evolve, Grizzard said, is to be open-minded. An example, he explained, is when he studies college tape of players that are on the Bucs’ draft radar. If he sees a play or a receiver route or a run-blocking scheme he likes or finds interesting, he makes a note to go back to that tape later to see if it can be incorporated into what the Bucs offense. “We can go from the college ranks; we can do studies from around the league to put our unique spin on it,” Grizzard said. “There are definitely things I’ve done in my past that I want to add to [the offense] to continue to apply pressure. “But again, the last thing you want is to get stagnant. So now we can take it to the next level.” That was Joe’s biggest concern with keeping the hiring process in-house. By bringing in someone from the outside who has fresh ideas, not unlike what the Bucs did with Coen did last year, Joe thought that would be a way to grow an already good offense. Apparently, from what Grizzard said, you can do both: Stay in-house and grow.|2025-02-06 21:19:00|418|21|7|Josh Grizzard|Embracing continuity while evolving Bucs' offense with fresh ideas.|5|Mixed sentiment on scheme continuity and potential improvements with room for evolution.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Rod Munch"", ""post"": ""Uh\u2026 the offensive scheme and play calling last year was insanely good."", ""post_time"": [""February"", ""6th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""9:25"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""KnoxvilleBuc"", ""post"": ""\u201cContinuity\u201d can be a dangerous word and I am in agreement it sometimes best to get a fresh perspective and fire.

Joe wanted to know when Grizzard, 34, who has never called plays, believed he was ready for his new job as a first-time NFL playcaller. Was there a moment or a specific year? Nothing concrete, Grizzard said, but he’s been preparing mentally since before he left the Dolphins after the 2023 season to join the Bucs. “When you’re in the booth and looking at coverages and just doing your mundane quality control work, you start thinking, ‘Ok, what do I call next? What do I call next? What’s this situation?'” Grizzard said. “Whatever it might be, so over the last two years trying to think in that way to prepare myself for this day.” Grizzard was promoted last week and met with assembled media today for about an hour. Some was on camera but most was in a more casual sitdown chat with no cameras allowed. Much to dissect, but Joe is starting with some of Grizzard’s recent evolution into his gig. The former high school quarterback turned Yale safety was an offensive assistant with the Dolphins from 2017 through 2023 through six Miami offensive coordinators. He soaked up plenty, but he also got a massive assist from former Bucs quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick. Grizzard told Joe that Fitzpatrick, who was a Dolphins QB in 2019 and 2020, used to take time to call things to Grizzard’s attention with an eye toward Grizzard becoming a playcaller one day. Sort of, “hey, be very aware of X, Y and Z when it comes time that you’re the boss. Don’t approach this defense in this way or that way. Always remember X when you’re dealing with Y.” Grizzard remains extrmely grateful to Fitzpatrick for that approach with a young coach in his 20’s with plenty to prove. The real-time action of a playclock counting down is nothing new to Grizzard. In response to Joe’s question about his game-day role last season, Grizzard said he was on the headset to Liam Coen regularly, talking to him about defensive alingments and serving up his takes on what plays could be set up to work later in games.|2025-02-06 19:01:00|375|12|7|Josh Grizzard|Grizzard prepares for NFL playcalling|5|Mixed sentiments with some optimism and confidence but also skepticism and uncertainty.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""David Kilmer"", ""post"": ""Sounds ready to come out blazing.

That’s right, Dimitroff, the former Patriots executive and Falcons GM, chose his buddy Jason Licht, the Buccaneers’ Ring of Honor general manager. So when Dimitroff talks Bucs, Joe pays attention. And that’s what Dimitroff was doing this week on WDAE radio. Asked about the Bucs potentially trading for Myles Garrett, the All-Pro Browns edge rusher who wants out of Cleveland, Dimitroff sees the Bucs as a fit. “I think Jason Licht has a really good understanding of the trenches,” Dimitroff said. “And I have a great deal of respect for him. And I think he goes in there and he knows that this would be a legit type of move that would set that team up for years to come.” While Dimitroff said trading two first-round draft picks is difficult, he implied it’s a different equation when a team doesn’t need a quarterback. Dimitroff, of course, kwows plenty about making big trades when your quarterback position is set. He shocked the NFL in 2011, trading up in the NFL Draft from No. 27 overall to No. 6 to draft Julio Jones. In addition to giving up the No. 27 overall pick, Dimitroff traded a 2012 first-round pick, plus second- and fourth-round picks in 2011 and two fourth-round selections in 2012. It was quite a haul and the Falcons surely never regretted the deal. Ironically, that trade also was with the Browns — while the Falcons had Matt Ryan as a young veteran franchise quarterback.|2025-02-06 11:06:00|272|92|8|Jason Licht|Ex-GM likes Myles Garrett fit with Bucs.|4|Mixed sentiments on trading for Myles Garrett due to concerns about costs and team needs.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Lamarcus"", ""post"": ""Yes but Miles Garrett said he wants to be known as a \u201cwinner\u201d.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/367491/|Time For Self-Reflection|For many coaches, once football season ends and after they maybe take a couple of days off to reacquaint themselves with this thing called “sleep,” the same coaches return to team headquarters and hit the ground running. They watching lots of tape of potential free agents and possible draft picks. But with Todd Bowles, there may be a bigger chore. Perhaps as important as scouting free agents or breaking down draft targets, Bowles said in his final media availability of the 2024 season that a “big” task for him will be self-reflection. What went wrong? What can he do to correct those things? And how can he be proactive so he’s not outcoached? “It’s a lot,” Bowles said of the time he will take in self-scouting and reflection. “The first thing you do is review everything you’ve done, see what they’re seeing, see what you see, see what you can change. “Then you’re always looking for fresh ideas, whether it’s high school, college, pro, pee wee ball. You’re always looking for fresh ideas, whether it’s pressures, whether it’s runs, whether it’s blocking schemes, whether it’s coverages. You’re always looking for fresh ideas going forward.” Well, Joe has a fresh idea for Bowles: embrace an edge rush. Even Bowles will be the first to admit his pass defense must improve. What’s the easiest way for a pass defense to improve? Find an edge rush and for the love of all that is holy, do not try to con yourself into thinking some dude who cannot put the bong down (allegedly) is the next Simeon Rice. Just imagine how much better Vita Vea and Calijah Kancey would be — and they are already two of the best defensive tackles — if defenses couldn’t double these guys up because offensive lines also have to tangle with a feared edge rusher. There is no time to develop a rookie (this year). Go out and get a proven veteran. Two guys just this week in the AFC North alone are barking about wanting to be with new teams, dudes who regularly have double-digit sacks each season.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/myles-garrett-thinks-hed-be-comfortable-in-a-3-4-defense/|Myles Garrett Is Sure He’d Be “Comfortable” In A 3-4 Defense|So the heavy panting for the Bucs to trade for All-World edge rusher Myles Garrett isn’t limited to the break room at JoeBucsFan.com world headquarters. Garrett (and his 13-sacks-per-year average) wants out of Cleveland by way of a trade. His contract is pricey but below market value for the 2025 and 2026 seasons. This week, Garrett is telling seemingly anyone that would listen that he just wants to go to a playoff-caliber team and push them over the hump. Joe asks: is there any playoff team in more desperate need of an edge rusher than Tampa Bay? And how many more sacks might Garrett get playing on a team with a top-shelf offense, so he can be in more games where his team is leading everyone knows the opponent is throwing? Garrett joined ESPN’s Mina Kimes yesterday at the Super Bowl’s Media Row and said not to pin him down as only a 4-3 defensive end. “If I have to stand up (as a 3-4 outside linebacker), I’ll do it,” Garrett said. “It’s something I haven’t been asked to do. But it’s something I’ve done in practice, something I’ve worked on. I feel like I’m comfortable just about anywhere.” No snide comments today about Todd Bowles asking Garrett to drop into coverage. But hey, Jason Pierre-Paul adjusted to it after being a 4-3 defensive end with the Giants. Joe has been pondering the likely price for Garrett: two first-round draft picks. Maybe a little more. Joe actually likes that cost but then starts thinking about the potential price to move up in Round 1 of the 2025 draft to select cornerback/receiver/Heisman Trophy-winner Travis Hunter. He’s an unreal prospect on both sides of the ball and is 8 years younger than Garrett. What a fun thought, comparing the cost and value of Garrett to the potential of Hunter on the Bucs’ roster. Back to reality, Garrett sure seems like he’d be happy to play in Tampa.|2025-02-06 10:10:00|325|42|7|Myles Garrett|Garrett wants trade to playoff-caliber team|2|Mixed opinions on trading for Miles Garrett, concerns about draft picks and locker room dynamics.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""BuckyBuc"", ""post"": ""Maxx Crosby make smore sense.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/todd-bowles-was-a-factor-for-jacksonville/|Todd Bowles Was A Factor For Jacksonville|Yeah, 2024 Bucs offensive coordinator Liam Coen slithered to Jacksonville to be their head coach, but Joe still will share a relevant nugget about El Serpiente, especially when it comes from a Hall of Famer. Tony Boselli is now the senior football czar for the Jaguars after his legendary years on the field and many more in the Jaguars’ broadcast booth. He chatted recently with talkSport, the England outlet that has ramped up its NFL coverage over the past two years, even interviewing Cade Otton and Zyon McCollum this season. Of note to Joe was Boselli saying the Jaguars’ executive team wasn’t focused on football during Coen’s second interview. Boselli explained that succeeding quickly in a major role with Todd Bowles inside a successful winning Bucs structure and culture, in addition to time around Sean McVay, was enough for Boselli and the Jaguars to know Coen is a stud coach that knows what everything around him should look like. They wanted to know if he had the chops to lead that kind of operation himself. Boselli emphasized that the Bucs are winners and that’s what the Jaguars want to be. It was an interesting nod to Bowles and Tampa Bay, one that isn’t heard vocalized often. Joe’s not suggesting the Panthers and Jaguars will meet in the Super Bowl in two years. It’s just nice to see the Bucs get respect.|2025-02-06 09:18:00|231|28|7|Todd Bowles|Boselli praises Coen's Bucs experience for Jaguars head coach role.|4|Mixed sentiments with skepticism towards Todd Bowles and varying opinions on the teams discussed.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Jeff"", ""post"": ""Panthers are the best team in the South now.

Joe will find out a lot more about that today when Josh Grizzard meets with media at One Buc Palace, but the 34-year-old has coached under Adam Gase, Brian Flores, Mike McDaniel, Liam Coen and Todd Bowles. That’s a mix that impresses Bucs running back Rachaad White, so he told Barstool Yak yesterday. White shared a few nuggets after working with “Grizz” last season when he was Bucs passing game coordinator/third-down specialist. “Swaggy dude. Brilliant mind. Young, electric, good energy,” White said of Grizzard. “Comes from a good tree; you can’t never go wrong with that. Todd Bowles’ been very good at hiring OCs, so, you know, hopefully Grizz can stay around.” Yes, Joe agrees. Hopefully Grizz can stick past this season.

No, Joe’s not talking about Antonio Brown, who was known to hurl trash in Licht’s direction. Joe’s referring to six-time Pro Bowl defensive tackle Gerald McCoy. McCoy clarified on The Green Light podcast this week that when fans heard he was mad at the Bucs after getting released before the start of the 2019 season, it wasn’t a Team Glazer thing or an issue with the new coaching staff. It was a rage at Licht. “The bad relationship was a narrative,” McCoy said. “It wasn’t the Bucs, it was me and Jason Licht. We had a beef, he just happened to be the GM. So it trickled down to, ‘oh, Gerald and the Bucs.’ And we worked that out [in 2019] right before we played [the Bucs] in London. I hugged the dude right before the game and made you all pay for it.” McCoy was referring to his then-Panthers team beating the Bucs 37-26 overseas. McCoy had 2 1/2 sacks against his old team. Unfortunately, McCoy didn’t explain his “beef.” McCoy was cut in May of 2019 with another year of his fat contract on the table. Perhaps money was McCoy’s beef, but Joe suspects it was more about timing, communication and the Bucs later handing McCoy’s No. 93 to Ndamukong Suh. Joe’s just guessing. Perhaps it their issue was more personal. Regardless, McCoy said his Bucs relationship is “fully rebuilt” and he is flattered that Team Glazer insisted McCoy be interviewed for the team’s 50th anniversary documentary that is being produced for this summer.|2025-02-06 08:47:00|278|19|7|Jason Licht|Gerald McCoy's beef with GM Jason Licht now resolved.|5|Mixed feelings about Gerald McCoy and Ndamukong Suh, with some negativity towards McCoy.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""OHBucFan"", ""post"": ""GMC was a kid in a beast body.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/baker-is-the-best-quarterback-ive-ever-played-with/|“Baker Is The Best Quarterback I’ve Ever Played With”|Boy, did Rachaad White ever say a mouthful yesterday. The Bucs’ running back was on Radio Row at the Super Bowl Media Center in New Orleans and he hopped on the “Doug Gottlieb Show” to chop it up with the part-time time sports radio host and part-time college basketball head coach. (Gottlieb is the head coach at the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay. Hollers about sports by day; hollers at players and refs by night.) White was talking to Gottlieb about his last three quarterbacks, almost a Who’s Who of quarterbacks. In his final year at Arizona State, White’s quarterback was Jayden Daniels. Then the Bucs draft White and he’s playing behind Tom Brady. Then Brady retires and the Bucs sign Baker Mayfield. That’s two Heisman Trophy winners and an all-time great. So of course, Brady was the best quarterback White ever played with right? He says no. “I say all the time, I’ve played with [Jayden Daniels and Tom] Brady and I’ve played with Baker,” White began. “You ask anybody, I’ve said, interview or not, [Mayfield] is the best quarterback I’ve ever played with.” That just blows Joe away White would say that. Did he say that because Mayfield is his current quarterback? Joe would guess, yes, but if you listen to White talk in this sitdown heard on FOX Sports Radio, it seems White likes well-rounded quarterbacks who can run, too. Brady couldn’t run. Daniels certainly can. And Mayfield can run. “Baker is a great guy,” White said. “Baker is a dawg. He’s a savage.” White said Mayfield only knows how to play football one way: balls to the wall. “That’s what you like about him,” White said. To be fair here, White played with Brady in his final year. So maybe White was turned off by Brady taking a vacation in training camp, or he just is sure Mayfield of 2023 and 2024 was better than Brady of 2022. And Joe does remember how, at San Francisco in White’s rookie season, Brady completely unloaded on his offensive teammates. Maybe that rubbed White the wrong way. Still, to hear from a guy who played for what looks to be a generational quarterback (Daniels) and also played with the greatest quarterback to have ever lived, and the same guy says Mayfield is the best is pretty astonishing. Joe is pretty sure even Mayfield would tell White he needs to slow down.|2025-02-06 07:00:00|401|46|5|Baker Mayfield|Rachaad White considers Mayfield best quarterback he's played with.|4|Mixed sentiments with some optimism and pessimism.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Statguy"", ""post"": ""I would say that too if I was being phased out"", ""post_time"": [""February"", ""6th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""7:02"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""LetsBucs"", ""post"": ""You answered that question yourself Joe.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/lovin-baker-mayfield/|Lovin’ Baker Mayfield|Until a year ago, Joe had never heard of this Bert Kreischer.. Last year Joe found out about Kreischer when he appeared (drunk) on Kay Adams’ show at the Super Bowl. There, he appeared with Bucs legend Derrick Brooks. The two bro-hugged it up and it was then Joe learned (from Brooks) that Kreischer lives in Tampa and is a big Bucs fan. Apparently, Kreischer is a comedian of some import. Joe’s never seen his standup and has no idea what movie he’s appeared in. Well, Kreischer came back to Adams’ show yesterday, live from the Super Bowl media center in New Orleans, and sat on the couch with former Bucs tight end foot-rubbing Rob Gronkowski. The three began talking about Baker Mayfield. Kreischer is a big fan of Mayfield, but not just because he’s a Bucs quarterback or a really good quarterback. Kreischer likes Mayfield because Mayfield plays quarterback his way and if you don’t like it, “s@ck it,” Kreischer said. “So I love the way Baker Mayfield plays football,” Kreischer said. “I love recklessness. That’s why I love Jameis Winston. “I don’t need you to be the cookie-cutter athlete that maybe Tom [Brady] was. … I love that Baker — I want the — this!” Kreischer then made a gesture with two hands to his crotch which is the universal language for “S@ck it!” Joe has never heard anyone describe Mayfield that way but it’s true! Whenever he runs over a linebacker or runs downfield to throw a block for Bucky Irving or completes a touchdown pass, you can just envision him running up to a defender and yell, “S@ck this!” That’s Mayfield in a nutshell, truly. Gronk also said that the attitude of Mayfield is why he loves him. “I do love Baker!” Gronk said. “As a quarterback, 100 percent that’s a great way to describe him. Team player. Going all out. Giving it his all. “Kind of a dawg as well and a dawg is kind of reckless. Not just a dawg where he’s a five-pound dog. He’s a pit bull.” Kreischer is expecting big things from Mayfield this fall. “We got a little bit of that [Kreischer repeated the gesture to his crotch] this year,” Kreischer said. “And we will get a lot of that [for the 2025 season].” Joe hopes to see Mayfield play like or just yell at defenders, “S@ck it!” enough for the Bucs to get a bye week in the playoffs next winter.|2025-02-06 03:45:00|412|33|7|Baker Mayfield|"Comedians praise Mayfield's ""reckless"" and team player attitude."|4|Mixed opinions on Baker, varying from praise to skepticism.

The loud-talking, small-producing once proud slimy Saints defensive end still hopes he doesn’t get cut by New Orleans. With the Super Bowl in the Big Easy this week, Jordan has been seen out and about, specifically on radio row. There, Jordan dropped in on Kay Adams’ show and told Adams he has no plans to play anywhere but for the slimy Saints. Joe stood and applauded. Jordan lately has been nothing more than an empty uniform, not even producing more than Joe Tryon-Shoyinka the past two seasons. Against the Bucs, Jordan has been Luke Goedeke’s female dog. The past two seasons Jordan had had six tackles in four games against the Bucs without a sack on Baker Mayfield. So if the slimy Saints want to keep Jordan, Joe is all for it. Because Jordan has been a complete non-factor against the Bucs. So yeah, yesterday was a good day for Bucs fans with this news.|2025-02-06 00:00:00|171|28|2|Cam Jordan|Cam Jordan commits to Saints.|2|Multiple negative and disrespectful comments towards Cam Jordan and the New Orleans Saints.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Bring back the lawn chairs"", ""post"": ""Oh man.
