What happened? It’s a mystery. Their 2022 fourth-round pick, Jake Camarda, had a hell of a rookie season and was never the same. Head coach Todd Bowles benched Camarda for two games last season in hopes he’d work out whatever was dragging him down. Was it personal or technical? Joe doesn’t know. But Joe has no knowledge of the Bucs bringing in a punting guru to work with Camarda. Strange. No team picked up Camarda in the regular season, which was telling. The Bills added him to their 2025 offseason roster. Trenton Gill replaced Camarda, and then Jack Browning finished the season. They weren’t special. Maybe Joe’s being harsh on Browning, who is 23 years old with limited experience. He didn’t wilt in the playoffs, but overall the Bucs’ punting was poor. So Joe’s wondering how seriously the Bucs will take the punter position this offseason. Good punters can be found. Look at the Chiefs. They signed the famous “Punt God,” Matt Araiza, before last season and he was excellent. He even set a Super Bowl record. They even let stud undrafted punter Tommy Townsend, a guy with two Chiefs rings, walk in free agency a year ago. He had an excellent season for the Texans on a modest two-year deal. When you’ve got an elite offense like the Bucs had last season, a great punter is less important. But a punter still represents critical hidden yardage. Unless rookie offensive coordinator Josh Grizzard can match the extraordinary output of his predecessor, the Bucs are going to need a legit punting upgrade.|2025-02-11 17:39:00|285|32|3|The Buccaneers|Bucs ponder punter situation for upcoming season|5|Mixed sentiments on punting situation, from optimism to pessimism and uncertainty about developments.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Rich"", ""post"": ""The one they signed from the cfl seems to have great potential\u2026.hate that word but my fingers are crossed"", ""post_time"": [""February"", ""11th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""5:48"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Bucnjim"", ""post"": ""I\u2019ll bet the defense wishes they had a punter like Ray Guy. 14 years in the league!"", ""post_time"": [""February"", ""11th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""5:49"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""FortMyersDave"", ""post"": ""Bucs have a lot of needs on defense and might need a guard and/or WR on offense so I hope Jason does not use a draft pick on a punter.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/michael-vick-extremely-proud-of-baker-mayfield-buccaneers/|Michael Vick “Extremely Proud” Of Baker Mayfield|Joe loved how quickly Michael Vick jumped at a chance to answer a question about Baker Mayfield last week.  Joe can’t wait for the Vick movie (allegedly in development/production) to be released. Has there been another quarterback who served two years in prison and then was an All-Pro soon after — at 30 years old? Vick knows plenty about being counted out, which seems to make him a big Mayfield fan, so he told Joe’s friend Rock Riley on The Rock Riley Show, Saturdays on WDAE radio. Rock asked Vick about Mayfield last week during Super Bowl festivities in New Orleans. “I might sound bias when I sit right here because I’m a big fan of quarterback play,” Vick began. “So I watch the guys around the league. I watch their process. I watch them go from rookie to 10-year player. And when I look at a guy like Baker, I’m just extremely proud of him because of the adversity. Somebody asked the question about being a champion; and when you get knocked down you get back up. “We’ve seen Baker down plenty of times to a point we didn’t even think Baker was every going to be a starter ever again. … Two back-to-back playoff seasons, and that’s amazing. And so, [the Bucs] didn’t miss a beat when Tom [Brady] left. Mike Evans still got his 1,000 yards every year. … Good things happened. They’re building a program.” Respect for Mayfield is growing around the NFL and, as Joe has said for over a year, Mayfield will lose his haters and be treated like a true superstar if he can have three straight strong years with the Bucs.

Others won’t even try because of the difficulty. Former Bucs left tackle Donovan Smith told Joe if he ever tried to move to right tackle it would be a disaster. He said to do that effectively he would have to relearn all his footwork and hand techniques. He firmly believed he couldn’t do it. When Bucs All-Pro right tackle Tristan Wirfs was moved from right to left tackle two years ago, he had reservations, likely for the same reasons. “It’s like learning to wipe your ass with your left hand,” Wirfs told Ari Meirov on The33rdTeam last week at the Super Bowl. Wirfs wasn’t gung-ho about the idea. But he’s a good soldier so he attacked the move, he explained to Meirov. “I knew, the more reps that I had, you know, the more comfortable I’d feel,” Wirfs said. “So I was like, I’m gonna take my lumps, like, I know it’s not gonna be perfect right away. I gotta keep working, get as many reps as I can.” Wirfs said the Bucs told him about the move in the spring before OTAs (Joe previously heard the Bucs first tipped off Wirfs off about the move in his 2023 season exit interview.) So Wirfs began working out with Luke Goedeke, training and preparing for change. “We were just training, training, training,” Wirfs said. “I was like, ‘It’ll click. It’ll feel comfortable. Eventually.'” “It’s like using a mouse with your left hand, like using chopsticks in your left hand,” Wirfs said. “I practiced [chopsticks] just so I could get comfortable with it,” Wirfs said. “It’s a big change. It’s huge, you know.” The more snaps Wirfs got, he figured, the better he would be. And in his second season at left tackle, Wirfs just became the NFL’s All-Pro left tackle, the first in NFL history to be All-Pro at both right and left tackle. So by eating with chopsticks left-handed, it helped Wirfs make NFL history.|2025-02-11 09:00:00|334|17|4|Tristan Wirfs|Wirfs learns and excels at flipping tackle positions in NFL.|7|Fans express high optimism and admiration for Wirfs' performance and attitude, celebrating his success.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""BucU"", ""post"": ""All Pro on both sides is ridiculous. the O line this upcoming season should be top 5 in the league."", ""post_time"": [""February"", ""11th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""9:09"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Baker Bowl"", ""post"": ""Love this guy.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/dianna-russini-bucs-came-within-two-losses-of-having-liam-coen-as-head-coach/|Dianna Russini: Bucs Were Two Losses From Likely Having Liam Coen As Head Coach|Joe has heard similar rumors in recent weeks in the wake of the Liam Coen drama. Now, a well-plugged-in, prominent NFL reporter has put her name on it. In a recent airing of the podcast “Scoop City,” co-host Dianna Russini of The Athletic claims the Bucs were prepared to make a head coaching change had they finished 8-9 or worse last month. And the benefactor of such a move would likely have been Coen, Russini told her co-host, former NFL quarterback Chase Daniel. “Now keep in mind I really think if Tampa didn’t make the playoffs, there was going to be a move there,” Russini said. “I think there was definitely going to be something with Todd Bowles. I don’t know if it would have meant parting of ways, a firing, a retirement. … “And with Liam being there — he [was] the guy. Right? Baker [Mayfield] loves him. They love him. It’s worked really, really well this year, and I know the organization thinks highly of [Coen]. … Again, we don’t know if that would have happened, but you have to figure it was probably something that was discussed when they weren’t winning, or at least when it appeared they weren’t going to win but they did.” Well, in December when Bill Belichick’s consigliere Michael Lombardi claimed Bowles was making plans to retire — Bowles on the record exclusively told Joe that was nonsense. So retirement wouldn’t have been the exit plan. (C’mon, Dianna, don’t read Joe? Why?) So instead of getting fired/retiring/getting shoved aside, Bowles ended up not just with a winning record, but his best regular season record as a head coach. And, per league rules, there is no Bucs contract that could have prevented Coen or any offensive coordinator from bolting to Jacksonville. Russini adds that she cannot blame Coen for racing to Jacksonville. Opportunities are fleeting in the NFL, she said, citing Bobby Slowik as an example. Last year Slowik, the Texans’ offensive coordinator, was a hot commodity as a head coaching candidate but he turned down job offers to stay in Houston. His reward for loyalty and patience? He got s(p)it-canned last month and is now looking for work.|2025-02-11 03:45:00|365|40|5|Dianna Russini|Bucs considered Liam Coen as head coach possibility.|2|Mixed feelings on coaching decisions and hypothetical scenarios, some negative comments.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""LetsBucsFan"", ""post"": ""They were probably even closer when Liam Coen was fired Reports came out that they *held off* on making him the HC previously because of some scarce reactionary behaviour.

BetMGM released its odds for teams to be the next Super Bowl champion and the Bucs are sort of a long-shot. In fact, Tampa Bay is currently tied with the Bears — the Bears! — for 10th-best odds to raise the Vince Lombardi Trophy aloft in the California night next February. BetMGM has the Bucs (and the Bears) at +4000 to win it all. The defending champion Eagles currently have the best odds to win “The Big Game” and repeat champions. Their odds are set at +650. The trance of Lamar Jackson is real as even the wiseguys in Vegas are mesmerized by one of the most overblown playoff quarterbacks in the game. BetMGM believes a guy who has one more playoff win than Baker Mayfield has +700 odds of winning the Super Bowl.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/free-agency-countdown-27-days-the-robert-hainsey-files/|Free Agency Countdown: 27 Days — The Robert Hainsey Files|The third-shift interns at JoeBucsFan.com world headquarters are all wearning No. 27 jerseys today. The countdown clock just went below 657 hours. At high noon on Monday, March 10, NFL teams will negotiate with agents and reach agreements to sign players in free agency. Ian Rapoport and the “sources” crowd will start reporting big-name signings on social media like Joe inhales TUMS after Bucs losses. Those deals can be made official on Wednesday, March 12. The Bucs are planning to play in free agency this season. Whether they play at the high-stakes tables is unclear. One guy the Bucs probably are hungry to keep is center/guard Robert Hainsey. The homegrown talent just finished his rookie contract. He’s 26 years old is known as a team-first guy who is tight with his fellow offensive linemen and Baker Mayfield. More important, Hainsey played a hell of a game in his lone start last season. Turn on the film. Hainsey was flat out balling against the slimy Saints in New Orleans as the Bucs ran for 277 yards and threw for 317 en route to a 51-27 win. Starting center Graham Barton returned a week later from his hamstring injury and Hainsey was back on the bench. Hainsey is durable, experienced and smart. That makes him an ideal backup. Joe has to think Hainsey has no desire to be a backup after starting in 2022 and 2023, but is he good enough to be paid like a free agent starter on the open market? That’s the $3.5 million question. And that’s what it might cost Tampa Bay to keep him for 2025. For those wondering, the Jaguars have veteran center Mitch Morse, a 2022 Pro Bowler for the Bills, under contract for 2025. Joe could see Hainsey having a market, especially for a team that wants a proven veteran on the roster as they sniff centers in the 2025 NFL Draft.|2025-02-11 03:41:00|318|21|7|Robert Hainsey|Robert Hainsey's impending free agency decision.|4|Commenters express mixed sentiments on Hainsey, varying from pessimistic to optimistic outlooks.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Defense Rules"", ""post"": ""Wouldn\u2019t blame Hainsey for wanting to test the FA waters for a possible starter gig.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/rachaad-white-details-the-biggest-lesson-he-learned-from-tom-brady/|Rachaad White Details The Biggest Lesson He Learned From Tom Brady|Joe still thinks it is wild that Rachaad White said of the last three quarterbacks he played with, Jayden Daniels, Tom Brady and Baker Mayfield, that the best he lined up behind is Mayfield. That doesn’t mean the Bucs running back was not influenced by Brady. White explained last week what he learned from Brady that still sticks with him two years later, while speaking with Baker Machado of Front Office Sports at the Super Bowl media center in New Orleans. “I think the biggest thing I learned from him, because obviously when I got drafted he was going through a difficult time, that’s is, you know, personal issues that he was going through [that] everybody knew about,” White began. “I think the biggest thing that I learned from him, though, is just like perseverance, man. “No matter what you going through, you signed up for [work and production]. You show up on time. Every day. You show up and you know, you keep working no matter what somebody feels about you or might think about you, or, you know, what they may look at you like. Just show up. You go to work to be your best self every day. And I think that’s the biggest thing I learned, perseverance.” That’s a pretty good lesson. And you know what, Joe thinks White does that. Game after game White didn’t get the job done running the ball in past years. But there he was, rarely if ever missing a practice. Working through and playing through injuries. When he got stepped over by Bucky Irving, you didn’t hear a peep from White. He kept doing what he always does: practicing and busting his tail. While Joe has been down on White’s running, he’s a good guy and he has his head right.
