https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/the-will-johnson-mystery/|The Will Johnson Mystery|Joe believes Todd Bowles drools a little every time he sees a long lean cornerback with big-time ball skills. Bowles loves long corners. Legendary NBA coach Hubie Brown used to say, ‘You can’t teach height.’ Bowles has that mindset and isn’t shy about it. Long corner? That describes University of Michigan prospect Will Johnson. He’s a consensus first-round pick but he’s shrouded in a bit of mystery because he didn’t run at the NFL Scouting Combine and he won’t participate in Michigan’s Pro Day, citing a hamstring issue. Many say Johnson’s speed is a question mark based on his film, so his eventual sprinting numbers may define his draft stock more than most. Allegedly, he will hold his own workout session for teams prior to the draft. Johnson is 6-2, 194 pounds. He had nine career interceptions at Michigan in 32 games played, including two pick-sixes last year. The 2023 All-American is a ballhawk — what Bowles says is his offseason focus. Johnson has thrived in big games (national championship defensive MVP) and he was schooled by his father, a former Michigan defensive back, from a very young age. He had the pressure of being a top college recruit in middle school and handled the pressure smoothly, starting as a true freshman for an elite Michigan team. That all sounds like a Jason Licht guy to Joe. Yes, Johnson has had injuries but nothing major. Still, guys with college injury histories often have them in the pros. Might Johnson fall to the Bucs at No. 19? It’s possible. The first cornerback off the board in last year’s draft was Quinyon Mitchell at No. 22 overall. He’s now got 20 starts under his belt and a Super Bowl ring. The second corner taken last year, Terrion Arnold at No. 24 overall, had an up and down season but the Lions are glad to have him. Joe can’t say the Bucs would go cornerback in Round 1, but Bowles might need a sedative if Johnson is there and the Bucs pass.|2025-03-20 17:24:00|339|30|7|Will Johnson|Michigan cornerback draft projections and potential challenges.|4|Mixed opinions and concerns about players with injuries and speed issues in the comments.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""WhatTheBuc"", ""post"": ""His tape looks good, but the fact that he won\u2019t test says he\u2019s slow. 4.5 would be fine at 6\u20192\u2033.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/local-disrespect-for-lavonte-david/|Local Disrespect For Lavonte David|So there’s been an obsession this week at JoeBucsFan.com world headquarters. At the Buccaneers’ official YouTube channel, the views of Lavonte David’s Monday news conference celebrating him agreeing to a 14th season with the team are less than the views of the news conference held minutes later featuring new Bucs backup offensive tackle Charlie Heck. How is that possible? Joe can’t stop refreshing to see if order has been restored. The total views of David’s video sit at about 5,600 as Joe types this. Heck’s got 5,800. The Friday news conference video for new Bucs edge rusher Haason Reddick has 15,000-plus views, so does the mid-March media session for Chris Godwin’s return. Joe thinks about that and considers how in a poll here three weeks ago, only 13 percent of fans said David was their top priority in 2025 free agency. Maybe David just isn’t that popular? Local fans don’t go crazy voting him into the Pro Bowl. However, legions of fans and the Bucs’ organization do proclaim deep love and affection for David and often bark about how he’s disrespected nationally. So that has Joe wondering why neither Todd Bowles nor Buccaneers Ring of Honor general manager Jason Licht showed up to be a part of David’s Monday news conference. No assistant coaches attended. No assistant GM. No players. No Glazers. If those folks all think David doesn’t get appropriate respect, then maybe they should realize their actions on Monday fit perfectly into that narrative. Did anyone invite franchise legend Derrick Brooks to the David news conference to help celebrate him signing up for a 14th Bucs season, which will tie Brooks’ historic Tampa Bay tenure? Joe doubts it. Joe will continue to monitor the views battle between the Heck and David videos.

New Bucs linebacker Anthony Walker has a lot to catch up on. So when he and the Bucs were talking about Walker possibly getting on I-75 North and driving four hours or so from his hometown in Miami to play for Tampa Bay, Walker spoke to his close friend and offseason workout buddy Lavonte David about what may be asked of him. In short, David told Walker to be ready for anything. “So one of the first things he told me is to just be ready to go, doing everything – blitzing, coverage, stopping the run, all that stuff,” Walker said. Walker confessed he is a competitor by nature — with video of him beating his good friend Lavonte David in a race. He promised to post that on social media soon. So the competitor in Walker was stoked when David texted him Wednesday morning: Buckle up. “The last thing he texted me just now was, ‘All right. It’s time to get to work,'” Walker said. “I’m like, ‘Dude, it’s still the offseason [laughs]. What’s wrong with you?’ “But that’s just kind of how we always competed, me and Lavonte, in the offseason and everything like that.” Walker said in so many words, if head coach Todd Bowles wanted a competitor to join his defense, he found one.|2025-03-20 10:30:00|222|15|7|Anthony Walker|New Bucs linebacker's competitive spirit impressed Lavonte David.|6|Mixed sentiment with optimism about new player but concern about injuries and uncertainty.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Todd Bowls"", ""post"": ""I like the fact that Lavonte recommended him and Jason signed him"", ""post_time"": [""March"", ""20th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""11:07"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""813BUCBOI"", ""post"": ""i think he will be a great addition to the defense\u2026 \u00a0 GO BUCS!!!!!"", ""post_time"": [""March"", ""20th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""11:13"", ""am""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""gp"", ""post"": ""If he\u2019s as good as advertised, we\u2019ll have the luxury of letting Jihad recover fully from his surgery if we pick him in the second or third rd"", ""post_time"": [""March"", ""20th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""11:27"", ""am""]}, ""commenter3"": {""username"": ""Buccaneer Bonzai"", ""post"": ""Lavonte David letting him know\u2026in Tampa, there is no off season for players\u2026or coaches."", ""post_time"": [""March"", ""20th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""11:33"", ""am""]}, ""commenter4"": {""username"": ""ATLBucSolar"", ""post"": ""Buccaneer Bonzai Says: March 20th, 2025 at 11:33 am Lavonte David letting him know\u2026in Tampa, there is no off season for players\u2026or coaches."", ""post_time"": [""ATLBucSolar""]}, ""commenter5"": {""username"": ""Defense Rules"", ""post"": ""I\u2019m admittedly not sure exactly what we\u2019ve got in Walker, but I\u2019m liking him more & more.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/throwing-down-the-bust-label/|Throwing Down The “Bust” Label|BY IRA KAUFMAN Yes, they’re still out there. Two former first-round picks of the Buccaneers are waiting for a job offer, well after the start of free agency. Neither one is old, neither one has a concerning history of major injuries and neither one can believe this is happening. Devin White and Jameis Winston are looking for work. The Bucs surely aren’t interested — and no other team is burning up the phone lines to talk to their agents. White’s case is more interesting because at one time, not that long ago, he was considered one of the NFL’s best young players. In 2021, the “Good Morning Football” crew sat around a table to seriously debate the question: “Is Devin White the best linebacker in the National Football League?” Now, at the age of 27, he can’t find a job. Why? He has an abundance of physical skills but lacks football instincts. He is viewed as a talented player who doesn’t love the game. That violates Jason Licht’s cardinal rule for evaluating prospects — are they passionate about football? It took Licht and Todd Bowles some time to realize the fifth overall pick in the 2019 draft was a poser. Who knew? He played a central role in helping the 2020 Bucs win a championship and the following year, his peers voted White the 28th-best player in the league. In 2022, White ranked at No. 64, still earning accolades from teammates and opponents alike who marveled at his 4.4 speed. “I wouldn’t be surprised if Devin was looked at as the best linebacker in the league for the next decade,” proclaimed Chris Godwin. Shaq Barrett added, “the speed makes him impossible to stop,” while former Eagles All-Pro center Jason Kelce observed, “he’s a guy that’s constantly around the ball.” But by 2023, White, unhappy with his contract situation, requested a trade from the Bucs. He was a disruptive force in the locker room and by the end of the season, he was no longer a starter. Hitting free agency, White signed a one-year deal with the Eagles, hoping to resurrect his career. Instead of brotherly love, Philadelphia showed him the door in midseason. White never played a snap for the Eagles and started only one game for Houston last year. Labeling White as a bust seems unfair. He was so dynamic during the 2020 postseason — 38 tackles, 2 interceptions and 2 fumble recoveries — that he was worth the draft pick for that reason alone. The bust designation is a better fit for Winston, the No. 1 overall choice in the 2015 draft. Winston threw for plenty of yards and touchdowns in Tampa, but poor decision-making, especially under pressure, led to his departure. During Winston’s 5-year run under center, the Bucs were a cumulative minus-35 in turnover differential and 28-42 on the scoreboard. He moved on to New Orleans as a backup for four seasons and started seven games for the Browns last year. Winston met with the Giants as a free agent this week, but his future remains unclear. “I’m praying for another opportunity to sling that pill and prove to these owners and head coaches that I can be a trustworthy quarterback,” Winston says. “I think that’s the only thing I haven’t proven since I’ve been in this league. I’ve had the numbers in terms of statistics, but man, I haven’t won enough games.” When it comes to the game’s most important position, trust is everything. The Bucs gave him every chance to earn their trust under three head coaches. He came close in 2019, when Bruce Arians was starting to believe in Winston before two disastrous outings at the end prompted the Bucs to move on. Even after Winston was no longer a Buccaneer, Licht spoke in his behalf. “We have a lot of respect for Jameis,” Licht said in 2020. “I thought he did a lot of great things. I would never say, and I think I speak on behalf of the organization, that he’s a bust. I think he’s got a bright future ahead of him.” Licht didn’t say it, but someone has to … Winston’s a bust. The first overall pick is supposed to get a second contract from the team that drafted him. That didn’t happen with Winston, who threw 28 interceptions in 27 games at Florida State before Licht pulled the trigger. Winston was a media darling during Super Bowl week in New Orleans and he may have a future in television. That future was supposed to be on the field in front of the cameras, not on a panel show, talkin’ sports.|2025-03-20 10:21:00|772|42|2|Devin White and Jameis Winston|Former Buccaneers face career struggles.|3|Mixed feelings, skepticism towards Winston and White, with some hope for improvement.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Allen Lofton"", ""post"": ""Both Winston and White are cases  with great physical talents but Brady proved mental compassity trumps everything"", ""post_time"": [""March"", ""20th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""10:52"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""First Last"", ""post"": ""I wonder if we would ever bring back Devin White.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/espn-bucs-still-need-a-starting-caliper-corner/|ESPN: Bucs Still Need A “Starting-Caliber Corner”|UPDATED: Maybe the Bucs aren’t done shopping yet. With the re-signing of former Jets starting cornerback Bryce Hall, Joe had a hunch that meant starting corner Jamel Dean was safe and Hall would be a swing corner with 20 or so snaps on defense and filling in for Zyon McCollum or Dean when they get hurt. And as sure as death, taxes and upsets in the NCAA tournament, Dean will get hurt. However, Jenna Laine of ESPN doesn’t think the Bucs are done shopping. Or at least she thinks they shouldn’t be. With Dean’s history of missing games — and now that he’s pushing 30 NFL players who get older don’t often get healthier — Laine seems to think the Bucs need a part-time starting corner ready to roll for when Dean is injured. And he will get hurt. [The Bucs] addressed cornerback depth in signing Kindle Vildor after Bryce Hall’s injury last year and Tyrek Funderburk and Josh Hayes’ struggles. But they need a starting-caliber corner as an insurance policy for Jamel Dean, who has struggled to stay healthy. Joe thought that was why the Bucs brought back Hall.|2025-03-20 07:00:00|190|30|5|Bucs|Bucs still need starting-caliber corner for injured Jamel Dean.|4|Mixed opinions on current corners and draft strategy, uncertainty on coaching effectiveness, need for improvement.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Win in the Trenches"", ""post"": ""Depth, depth and more depth\u2026. is how you survive 17 game schedule plus preseason\u2026."", ""post_time"": [""March"", ""20th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""7:06"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""OHBucFan"", ""post"": ""Am liking the Freudian slip.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/jihaad-campbell-surgery-may-benefit-bucs/|Jihaad Campbell Surgery May Benefit Bucs|Bad news for Alabama linebacker Jihaad Campbell; good news for the Bucs. The way folks were talking about this Campbell, who is a beast, Joe was starting to get scared some team before the Bucs pick at No. 19 may grab him, or trade down so another team could pick him ahead of the Bucs. It appears, per Jordan Reid of BSPN, that Campbell had shoulder surgery for a torn labrum just days after the combine. That tells Joe that all the medical tests conducted at the combine found the injury. Or, Campbell may have injured the shoulder at the combine. It is unclear when Campbell got hurt. He left the Alabama-Michigan Outback Bowl on Jan. 1 with what the team deemed “an upper-body injury.” Per Charean Williams of Pro Football Talk, a torn labrum can take as long as eight months of post-surgery rehab to heal. That could put Campbell on the shelf through October. Why is Joe smiling at someone’s misfortune? Well, if Campbell can’t play Week 1, perhaps his surgery and unavailability at the start of the season will spook enough teams to allow Campbell to fall into Bucs AC/DC-loving general manager Jason Licht’s lap?|2025-03-20 03:45:00|198|67|4|Jihaad Campbell|Campbell injury may benefit Bucs in draft selection process.|3|Concerns about Campbell's injury impacting immediate contributions, preference for other positions and players.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Leopold Stotch"", ""post"": ""That\u2019s a heck of a risk for a first round pick.

Not even for a sad franchise like the Giants when he wasn’t getting many snaps. That passion for football had a “resurgence” for Shepard when he came to the Bucs, Shepard told the local pen and mic club yesterday. Seeing how two of the very best in football, Mike Evans and Tristan Wirfs prepare, Shepard said, lit a fire under him. “Seeing the way that Mike [Evans] attacks the game, seeing the way that Baker [Mayfield] attacks the game, Tristan [Wirfs], and all of those guys – it lights you up and it makes you want to give your all for those guys,” Shepard said. “I knew that I had a lot to give in the tank after leaving New York – it was just kind of the situation and not really being in a position to play as much and them wanting to go with the younger guys, which was understandable. “I knew I had a lot more to give and as soon as I got my opportunity [with the Bucs], I tried to make the most of it. I feel like I have a little bit of ball left to play and I just want to max it out all of the way.” This is great in more ways than one, Joe believes. For example, if Shepard, now entering his 10th season, is fueled and motivated, imagine what younger teammates think when they see two guys like Evans and Shepard, and a young guy like Wirfs busting their tails? They have to think, “Gee, if those guys are working that hard, I better get off my tail.” Joe believes this is residue from when Tom Brady was here. He worked like a maniac. Evans and Wirfs, and others like Chris Godwin, have grabbed that torch and it has set a standard around One Buc Palace. And Joe thinks this is also one reason why the Bucs really don’t miss Devin White all that much.|2025-03-20 00:00:00|344|16|8|Sterling Shepard|Shepard finds motivation with talented teammates at Bucs.|5|Mixed sentiments with some positivity and negativity towards the player.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Aqualung"", ""post"": ""The root of Shep\u2019s mistakes \u2013  boneheaded penalties in particular \u2013 was that he was over juiced.
