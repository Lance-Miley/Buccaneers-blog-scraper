https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/those-days-are-over-2/|“Those Days Are Over”|BY IRA KAUFMAN It’s THE sunny story of the 2024 Buc season through 12 games. Yes, Baker Mayfield is enjoying another solid year under center and yes, Vita Vea and Calijah Kancey have formed a stellar tandem at defensive tackle.  But the No. 1 takeaway with five games remaining is the massive improvement in Tampa Bay’s rushing attack. After finishing last in each of the past two seasons, the Buc run game now commands the full attention of every opponent. Rookie Bucky Irving and Rachaad White trigger a run brigade that averages 137.2 yards per game and 5.1 yards per carry. The Bucs joined the NFL in 1976 — they’ve never averaged more than the 4.8 yards per carry accomplished in 2015. That ground game was led by Doug Martin and Charles Sims, who each averaged 4.9 yards. Donovan Smith and Ali Marpet started up front as rookies that year while veteran Logan Mankins provided key leadership at left guard. Sunday’s opponent is clearly aware of the power of the Buc ground game, which has averaged 167.7 yards in the past three games. “They’ve established an identity,” says Oakland defensive coordinator Patrick Graham. “You can see they are a run-first team.” During Tom Brady’s three years in Tampa, the Buc running game was considered an afterthought. That’s why Brady averaged 41 pass attempts in his 50 games as a Buccaneer. Mayfield is averaging 34 throws and that number figures to come down in the stretch run as Todd Bowles emphasizes ball security and winning the time of possession. What’s changed?  Irving’s arrival as a fourth-round steal is certainly a major factor, but there’s more to the story. Liam Coen has proven to be a creative play caller, especially in scheming up the run to keep defenders off balance. Buc fans no longer have to endure the spectacle of White repeatedly running between the tackles, to no avail. Some of White’s longest gains this year have come off wide runs. At times, the Bucs have run effectively with both White and Irving on the field. Coen’s imaginative designs have certainly contributed to the success of the league’s No. 8 ground game. Let’s not forget the grunts in the trenches who are making things happen. Tristan Wirfs has had a solid season at left tackle, but you can make a compelling argument that Luke Goedeke has been even better. The switch from left guard to right tackle has turned Goedeke from a project to a potential Pro Bowler. He’s been that good. Graham Barton has done a nice job at center as a rookie, although he struggled at Carolina. At guard, Cody Mauch and Ben Bredeson have consistently showcased their physicality in the run game. It helps to have continuity up front and Tampa Bay’s five starters have combined to miss only six games. According to Graham, Mayfield has done a consistently nice job of getting Tampa Bay into the right run fits at the line of scrimmage. “This is a Top 10 offense in almost every category,” Graham says. This enhanced ground game has powerful ramifications. The Bucs are second behind the Chiefs in third-down conversion rate, in large part because they stay ahead of the sticks with efficient runs. Tampa Bay is also tied for third in red zone success, scoring touchdowns on 66.7 percent of drives that advance to the opponent’s 20-yard line. “For me, it’s the ability to run the ball,” says Graham. “They’ve got a bunch of big guys up there who can move bodies.” Can the Bucs maintain their current production on the ground? We’re about to find out, but there’s nothing artificial about these numbers. For example, Tampa Bay’s average of 5.1 yards per carry is tied for second with Philadelphia, Arizona and Washington — all behind Baltimore. Notice that all four of the other teams on the list feature mobile quarterbacks. Mayfield isn’t a statue, but he averages only 19 yards per game off scrambles. That pales in comparison to Lamar Jackson (52.2), Jalen Hurts (40.4), Kyler Murray (35.7) and Jayden Daniels (45.4). For the previous two seasons, Tampa Bay’s play action didn’t work because nobody respected the run game. Safeties didn’t feel the need to creep up and linebackers took deep drops, daring the Bucs to hand the ball off. Those days are over … perhaps for quite awhile. |2024-12-06 16:29:00|726|31|'8|Those Days Are Over|Bucs' rushing game transforms franchise.'|4|Mixed sentiments with some optimism but also skepticism and criticism.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""David Pear"", ""post"": ""\u201c Those Days Are Over \u201c"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""6th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""4:56"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Let em bake"", ""post"": ""So many positives.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/bucky-irving-questionable-for-raiders-game-on-sunday/|Bucky Irving Questionable For Raiders Game|[UPDATE: 4:09 p.m.] Not good news from the final injury report for the Raiders-Bucs game on Sunday at The Licht House. One of the top stories in the game and breakout NFL running back star Bucky Irving was limited in practice today after not practicing Wednesday and Thursday. As a result, Irving is listed as questionable for Sunday with hip/back issues. After Sunday’s game, Irving left the field with what appeared to be some sort of wrapping around his midsection. Someone asked Irving if he was alright and Irving shot back, “F’ no!” Linebacker K.J. Britt (ankle), safety Mike Edwards (hamstring), cornerback Troy Hill (foot) and outside linebacker Markees Watts (who?) (knee) have all been declared out for Sunday. Also, cornerback Josh Hayes (hamstring), receiver Trey Palmer (hip), inside linebacker J.J. Russell (hamstring), nickel corner Tykee Smith (knee) and outside linebacker Joe Tryon-Shoyinka (ankle) each join Irving as questionable. If Russell cannot go along with Britt, may Brock Bowers have mercy on us all. [UPDATE: 4:09 p.m.] Troy Hill was on the injury report as “out” for Sunday. Since the report was released, maybe a handful of minutes, the Bucs announced he was placed on injured reserve. So at best, Hill may play in the final regular season game at home against the slimy Saints.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/trainers-play-a-role-in-touches-for-running-backs/|Trainers Play A Role In Touches For Running Backs|Since Bucs offensive coordinator Liam Coen has been on board, one of many things that has impressed Joe is how he offers a window into how the Bucs work under the hood in developing a gameplan for an opponent. It actually begins not long after a season is over. For example, Coen stated how he met with Bucs trainers before OTAs began because they wanted to find out how he would use receivers, among other players. Coen told trainers he would have receivers running “a lot” in pre-snap motion. So the trainers then tailored personal workout packages and regimens for the receivers to increase their stamina. This week, Joe knows some fans kvetched about running back Bucky Irving not playing more, specifically late in the Bucs’ overtime win over the Stinking Panthers — despite Irving easily touching the ball more than he has all season (25 carries, three catches). Joe asked Coen if he had a pitch count with running backs with the long haul in mind. (Also, there’s the unspoken rookie wall that is likely about to hit Irving, if it hasn’t already.) Coen noted that usage is not a big concern, though it is a concern as a game transpires. He said he’s more worried about what a running back’s mental state is. If he’s hungry for more, Coen is unlikely to sweat feeding him more. However, Coen said he gets input into running back usage from Bucs trainers. “Our trainers and everybody [do] a really good job of letting us know where they’re at, how many snaps, what’s the goal this game,” Coen said. “We try to stay collective with that.” Joe had not heard this before. Oh, Joe’s heard about trainers telling a coach a player shouldn’t be used because he is hurt. But Joe had never heard a coach say publicly he bases a decision to use a player, in part, on trainer feedback on stamina, both during a game and for future use. Perhaps Joe’s just a football geek but this sports science stuff is pretty cool.|2024-12-06 13:23:00|343|22|6|Trainers|Trainers provide feedback on player stamina for game usage and future.|4|Mixed sentiment regarding player usage and trainer effectiveness.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/the-buccaneers-history-when-6-6/|The Buccaneers’ History When 6-6|So five times in Tampa Bay lore have the Buccaneers found themselves with a 6-6 record.  That’s not couting the current team’s 6-6 record. The last time was with Tom Brady in 2022. The Bucs got to 6-6 and then lost their next two games and finished 8-9, which was good enough to win the NFC South. (Remember, the Bucs clinched the division a week early and rested starters in the finale.) Before that, the Bucs were 6-6 with Lovie Smith in 2015. Lovie then got out a shovel and buried himself with four straight losses to end the ’15 season. Two brutal Doug Martin fumbles in Week 16 were devastating and then the Bucs had their doors blown off by the eventual NFC champion Panthers to close the year. In 2012, new head coach Greg Schiano got to 6-6 after a 6-4 start with a revived Josh Freeman at quarterback. At 6-6, Tampa Bay choked at home against the Eagles before a soldout crowd when the Bucs honored the 10-year anniversary of their first Super Bowl. Nick Foles threw the game-winning touchdown with no time left on the clock. A 6-6 record was never a thing during the Father Dungy-Jon Gruden years, but the Bucs were 6-6 in 1995 with Sam Wyche. That team then hit the road for Minnesota and got smoked. The Bucs trailed 28-7 at halftime and starting Bucs QB Trent Dilfer didn’t finish the game. Wyche was fired after the season. Joe had to go back to 1981 to find another Bucs record of 6-6. The Bucs and starting QB Doug Williams won their next game and three out of four to close the season at 9-7. They won the NFC Central (yes, “Central) but got blown out 38-0 by Dallas in the playoffs. So the Bucs are 1-4 when they have a 6-6 record. If Todd Bowles can’t chalk up a “W” at this critical juncture, he might find himself under a tremendous microscope.|2024-12-06 12:46:00|330|15|3|The Buccaneers|Mixed history at 6-6.|8|Mixed sentiments about past and future success with some optimism for the team's performance.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""LouisFriend"", ""post"": ""There are two home games against the Raiders that stand out from all the rest.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/bucs-thin-ilbs-just-got-thinner/|Bucs’ Thin ILBs Just Got Thinner|If any Bucs fans are remotely spiritual, now is the time to ask your higher authority for Lavonte David’s continued health. Today, Bucs coach Todd Bowles announced that starting inside linebacker K.J. Britt will not play against the Raiders. Joining him on floppy hat patrol for Sunday will be Mike Edwards, Troy Hill and milk carton Markees Watts. However, Bowles did not rule out starting nickel corner Tykee Smith, who has been sidelined with a knee issue. “We’re going to work him out before the game and see where he’s at as far as what he knows gameplan-wise and we’ll go from there,” Bowles said. The insider linebackers for the Bucs past David frighten Joe. It didn’t take too long this season for teams to show they had adjusted to Britt and he has been exposed terribly in the passing game. So it appears J.J. Russell and Vi Jones, who was with the Bucs for nearly a full calendar year before Bowles deemed him sufficiently ready to be called up from the practice squad. What healthy player needs damn near a year before he’s “ready?” If David, God forbid, goes down, Joe has a feeling so too will the Bucs’ chances at a playoff berth. It’s almost to the point where Joe would only allow David to participate in walk-throughs.|2024-12-06 12:00:00|220|44|1|Bucs|Concerns over linebacker depth and injuries for upcoming game.|2|Mixed sentiments about players, coaching, defensive performance, and upcoming game.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Jmarkbuc"", ""post"": ""\u201cSee what he knows game plan wise\u201d"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""6th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""1:03"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Saskbucs"", ""post"": ""I think that could have been said week 3.

Well, all that happiness hasn’t translated into ticket sales. (Yes, Joe’s sarcasm button is on.) Over at the Buccaneers’ official online ticket seller, the fee thieves at TicketMaster, unsold seats for Sunday’s game against the Raiders are available in more than 65 stadium sections, spanning all levels of The Licht House. The unsold “cheap” seats start at $91.00 plus fees. Joe also sees pairs of tickets (together) for sale at reseller StubHub starting at $47.00 each plus fees, way under face value. The Bucs haven’t had a home game in four weeks — four! So Joe’s not sure what this says about excitement for Todd Bowles’ team.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/21-first-or-second-year-players-on-the-field/|21 First- Or Second-Year Players On The Field|So the Raiders come to Tampa this weekend as a super-young team that doesn’t know how to win — along with an inexperienced head coach that may be fired in a matter of days. Sounds on paper like a lay-up victory for a Bucs team sprinkled with Super Bowl winners, Hall of Famers, big-money Pro Bowlers and an upper-tier quarterback, something the Raiders don’t have. In fact, Las Vegas has 21 first- or second-year players on the field last Friday against the Chiefs, a game Raiders’ coaches, as well as players, choked away in the final seconds. Yes, the Raiders are scrappy, and ex-Raider and Hall of Fame defensive lineman Howie Long this week praised his old club’s character, pride and lack of quit for first-year head coach Antoino Pierce. However, Joe wonders how the Monday SI.com report from NFL insider Albert Breer might impact Sunday’s game. Breer made it sound like Pierce is gone and the Raiders will draft a quarterback. All those young Raiders could be very impressionable. That said, the Bucs also have plenty of first- and second-year players on the field in key roles. And Joe wants to see them rise up and show they’re up for playoff-mentality football. Can Graham Barton shake off his rough Sunday? Can Bucky Irving play through injuries? Can Tykee Smith get back on the field? Will Baker Mayfield find a way to trust Trey Palmer and Jalen McMillan, receivers who have combined for just 23 catches this season? Much will be proven for both young clubs on Sunday.|2024-12-06 11:06:00|258|9|3|Raiders vs. Bucs|Young teams face off with uncertain futures.|2|Mixed sentiments with skepticism, hopes for improvement, and playoff mindset emphasized.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""MadMax"", ""post"": ""This is not an automatic win\u2026the rest of the games may look easy but thats how they get you!

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/im-shocked-theyre-favored-by-6-1-2/|“I’m Shocked They’re Favored By 6 1/2”|So how is the Bucs’ defense playing? The answer depends on who you ask. The purely pragmatic type might quickly point out that Tampa Bay allows 24.7 points per game, which ranks 25th in the NFL. That’s a scary reality considering the Bucs have high-priced/ legitimately-priced talent at every level of the defense. That same pragmatist might also note that the Bucs ranked 7th in points allowed last season at 19.1 points per game. Is Devin White missed that much? The Bucs defense has been soft since the second half of the slimy Saints game on post-Hurricane weekend. The defense has been gouged outside of the cozy confines of MetLife Stadium, where the league-worst Giants rolled out their third-string quarterback. Consider that the 49ers piled up 413 yards on the Bucs in early November and haven’t put up 300 yards in a game since. On Sunday, the Bucs made Panthers QB Bryce Young look like a solid starter. Anyone think he’s going to look like a JV player in Philadelphia this week? Former Bucs QB Chris Simms likes the Bucs to beat the messy Raiders at The Licht House on Sunday, but Simms told Pro Football Talk that he’s seen enough of the Bucs defense to be skeptical they can lock down anyone. “I’m shocked they’re favored by 6 1/2,” Simms said of Tampa Bay. “Kind of everybody moves the ball on them except the Giants with Tommy DeVito. So that’s where I was shocked.” Simms added that he’s had respect for the Raiders defense through this season. Joe theoretically agrees with Simms, but the Raiders (2-10) are a horrible team with lots of injuries, a team likely to fire its head coach, and a team that’s lost eight in a row. Of course the Bucs are a touchdown favorite.|2024-12-06 09:53:00|300|21|4|Bucs' defense|Mixed reviews on Bucs' defensive performance and upcoming game prediction.|3|Mixed sentiments with concerns about Bucs defense, injuries, and optimism for winning the game.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Caleb"", ""post"": ""Raiders are 2-10.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/bspn-math-favors-bucs/|BSPN: Math Favors Bucs|Joe still has deep, unsettled issues with nuns and math. But at the end of the day, math doesn’t lie (but numbers do!). Joe will let Dan Graziano of BSPN take over here. He and the statheads at the four-letter say, with five games left in the regular season, the Bucs have the edge to win the NFC South and host another playoff game this winter. Graziano said that while he was inclined to pick the Cardinals or Rams as a team considered an “outsider” to make the playoffs, Graziano admits the math says the Bucs, who while tied with the Dixie Chicks at 6-6, are on the wrong end of a tiebreaker. Tampa Bay has a 56.5% chance to make the playoffs, per ESPN’s Football Power Index, which is higher than any NFC South team. So while I would have loved to make the case for the Cardinals or Rams and stay consistent with what I said here last week, I can’t ignore the math or the fact that the Falcons really aren’t playing well. Well, are the Bucs playing well? They sure did against the Giants but damn if they didn’t look like they tried to lay an egg last week in Charlotte. Nothing about the Bucs defense fills Joe with any degree of trust. And after the miracle win over the Stinking Panthers, “this Joe” doesn’t trust this team to run the table. Even ending the season 4-1 seems like a mountain to overcome. “This Joe” hopes to be wrong and that the Bucs dominate each game like they did in New Jersey two weeks ago.|2024-12-06 07:00:00|269|17|7|Joe|Math gives Bucs advantage to win NFC South.|4|Mixed feelings about Bucs' chances in playoffs due to defensive concerns and schedule challenges.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Gbobucsfan"", ""post"": ""I really don\u2019t want this to happen but I have a crazy feeling that atl beats the vikings this week."", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""6th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""7:20"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""George R"", ""post"": ""Here it is, you only can control what you can control.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/todd-bowles-has-to-be-salivating/|Todd Bowles Has To Be Salivating|Think of the tingling sensation that goes through your head when you think of the hottest woman you’ve ever seen in real life. Well, that’s the same rise NFL defensive coaches get fantasizing over turnovers. Defensive coaches are something else. Nothing gets these guys hot and bothered like the thought of turnovers. It’s in their DNA. They are fully obsessed. Joe likes to (sort of) joke that he doesn’t do fantasy football because his fantasy has absolutely nothing to do with football but everything to do with a comely brunette and a secluded Caribbean island. For defensive coaches, turnovers are their fantasies. So when Joe read this piece from Rich Hribar of Sharp Football Analysis documenting how the Raiders cough up the ball on the road like a dude in a bar who tried to wolf down a half-dozen Carolina Reaper pepper wings too quickly, Joe immediately thought of Bucs coach Todd Bowles. He may need a cold shower after reading the following. Las Vegas has turned the ball over on a league-high 19% of their possessions on the road. Talk about playing Santa Claus. Hey, turnovers are great, so long as you can turn those gaffes into touchdowns. Defensive coaches seem to be convinced turnovers win games. All they do is give your offense a chance to score. Turnovers don’t mean jack if you can’t put the ball in the end zone. And that’s Joe’s hang-up with the obsession of turnovers. Punts are turnovers too. The game is still all about blocking, tackling and, most importantly, scoring touchdowns. Tom Brady threw three picks on the road in the NFC championship game in January 2021. But the Bucs still won. Why? They scored touchdowns. The Fighting Schianos were third-best in the league in takeaways in 2013 but former Bucs commander Greg Schiano had a lousy record (4-12). Why? He had Mike Glennon at quarterback and the Bucs were third-worst in points per game (18.0). Getting points off turnovers?

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/liam-coen-hints-choosing-rb-in-red-zone-is-not-a-priority/|Liam Coen Hints Choosing RB In Red Zone Is Not A Priority|Joe has been a big Liam Coen fan. “This Joe” thinks the Bucs’ first-year offensive coordinator has done such a good job that he won’t be here next year. Off to greener pastures. That doesn’t mean Joe believes Coen is perfect. Who he had in the game to take a handoff at running back when the Bucs were deep in the 49ers red zone, Joe thought was a mistake (Rachaad White). And Joe knows Bucs fans want Bucky Irving on the field in the red zone. Irving has exploded to be one of the best running backs in the league. Yesterday, Coen was asked for his thought process for choosing whether to have Irving or White on the field in the red zone. It’s not a priority for him. “I’m not really thinking about it that much, honestly,” Coen said. “It just depends on if we have something truly specific within the plan that we’re trying to get one of those guys specifically on. “It’s more so just going with what’s working in the red zone. I was always kind of taught that if you can run the ball into the end zone, you would like to be able to do that.” So that begs the question, then why isn’t Irving in the game? Surely Coen has specific plays for him in the red zone or at least in short-yardage situations. Not feeding Irving inside the 49ers-10 backfired on Coen four weeks ago and having White run east-to-west in overtime inside the Stinking Panthers-10 damn near backfired on him last Sunday. Get your best players the ball. That philosophy worked for Nick Saban and it works in general for winning football teams. And right now there are few players currently playing better than Irving.|2024-12-06 00:00:00|294|20|3|Liam Coen|Red zone running back choice controversy.|7|Mixed sentiments on game strategies and players, with some optimistic and some critical views.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""ModHairKen"", ""post"": ""You better start thinking about it much, honestly, Coen."", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""6th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""12:17"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Crickett Baker"", ""post"": ""I believe Bucky had been in pain and that is the main reason he was not used on that play."", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""6th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""12:33"", ""am""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""B"", ""post"": ""Am I nuts or shouldn\u2019t Tucker be the short yardage guy?
