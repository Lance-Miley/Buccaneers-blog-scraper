https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/todd-bowles-running-winning-in-the-playoffs/|Todd Bowles: Running = Winning In The Playoffs|Bucs coach Todd Bowles was talking playoffs this morning. Something he’s done for the past five Bucs seasons, the first two as defensive coordinator. Succeeding in the playoffs, Bowles believes, means a team has to accomplish a few things. The first, Bowles said, is just getting there. Since that hurdle has been cleared, it’s time to forget it. Worry about the task at hand. “I think you’ve got to take care of the football, I think you’ve got to be able to run it, and I think you’ve got to stop the run,” Bowles said. Well, in that respect the Bucs weren’t perfect. The Bucs had a negative turnover/takeaway ratio, but they rank fourth in the league in rushing. Defensively, the Bucs are also fourth against the run. “I think you’ve got to limit the mistakes and the penalties,” Bowles added. “Those things all come down to it at the end. If you can do those things, you have a chance of winning the football game.” The mistakes come and go and that’s the danger of the playoffs. Sometimes teams show up and play a clean game. Sometimes they make head-scratching choices. In close games, it is often the team that makes the fewest mistakes is the team that will, as the late North Carolina State basketball coach Jim Valvano would say, “Survive and advance.”|2025-01-10 15:57:00|225|37|7|Todd Bowles|Playoff success factors and importance of minimizing mistakes.|3|Mixed sentiment with concerns about defense and coaching, some optimism, and frustration expressed.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Ds"", ""post"": ""Run the damn ball coen"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""10th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""4:12"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Jethro Tull"", ""post"": ""Coach talks about running the ball and stopping the run.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/happy-mike-evans-day/|Happy Mike Evans Day!|How are you celebrating Mike Evans Day? Perhaps Joe should drop money on Evans’ foundation in honor of his day. He’s done so much for folks in the area. That seems fitting. After all, Evans has given and is giving Bucs fans plenty of highlights for the past 11 years. Today, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Bucs fan himself (he’s from Dunedin), declared today “Mike Evans Day.” DeSantis even had a proclamation about Evans. You can see it below. Pretty cool. Not every day a football player has a statewide day named after him (at least for a day) to honor what he has meant to the Tampa Bay community. You can see the proclamation below.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/sacks-will-kill-the-bucs/|Sacks Will Kill The Bucs|Sacks are drive-killers. You read that from Joe in one of many, many, many, many rants and screeds about the lack of a proven, healthy, young edge rusher. Joe will never let up on this until the Bucs succeed at doing something about it. As in finding a legit edge rusher. Anyway, sacks are drive-killers. When offenses suffer a sack, the odds that a touchdown is scored on the same drive plummets like a bad penny stock. So if the Bucs could get more sacks from the edge, it would sure help out the defense. Alas, this works both ways. When the Bucs, who have one of the better offenses in the NFL, see quarterback Baker Mayfield eat a sack, the Bucs’ scoring chances fall off the cliff, as documented by Rich Hribar of Sharp Football Analysis. When Tampa Bay was not sacked on possession, they averaged 3.13 points per drive, second in the NFL. But on any drive with a sack, they averaged 0.95 points per drive, which was 20th. Now Hribar wasn’t specific if that meant 20th overall or 20th for teams whose quarterbacks have to swallow a sack on a possession. Regardless, Joe isn’t out of line with the following: Calling All-Pro left tackle Tristan Wirfs and his posse. We know it is now the playoffs and your antennae are raised high and are alert. But if you guys can keep Mayfield upright, Joe likes the Bucs’ chances against the Commandos.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/bakers-petty-in-that-way/|“Baker’s Petty In That Way”|Yeah, a little sizzle is lost from Sunday’s pending Mike Evans-Marshon Lattimore clash at The Licht House in Round 1 of the NFL playoffs. Lattimore, the Commanders cornerback, is likely to shadow Evans all around the field and the two angry rivals are sure to do plenty of spirited hand fighting. But Lattimore is no longer wearing the colors of the slimy Saints. That Saints-Bucs hatred was the foundation of the annual Evans-Lattimore feuds and Washington seems to be a rather classy club that’s hard to dislike. Still, the Lattimore-Evans intensity is alive and well, and former Bucs cornerback Richard Sherman (2021) is confident it will get a little nasty on Sunday night. Joe was intrigued to hear Sherman’s take because he was in that elite cornerback club with Lattimore, who used to be elite, but also played with Evans and covered him during his years with the 49ers and Seahawks. While the Commanders and Bucs don’t have deep conflicts, Sherman said this week Commanders teammates will have Lattimore’s back and things could heat up quickly. “I’m sure they’re going to have Lattimore follow him,” Sherman told Up & Adams. “He’s going to continue to try and get under Mike’s skin.” Sherman also said he expects Baker Mayfield to embrace the Evans-Lattimore heat and feed off it. “Baker’s petty in that way and I like that about him,” he said. Joe’s just worried about distractions. Evans had weeks of distractions chasing 1,000 yards in the regular season. It would have been nice if Evans could have gotten a clear-headed week, but that’s not in the cards. Lattimore is returning from a hamstring injury, so Joe sure hopes the Bucs test that early and often. Is this the week the go-ball shot to Evans returns to the gameplan?|2025-01-10 15:13:00|297|29|7|Baker Mayfield|Clash between Evans and Lattimore in upcoming NFL playoff game.|5|Mixed sentiments on Bucs' chances against Saints, with concerns about trade deadline and individual performances.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Henry"", ""post"": ""The Bucs will win this game.

Safety Antoine Winfield, Jr. will return from his bad knee that cost him the past four games. Winfield did not go on injured reserve and resumed practicing full-go this week. Starting cornerback Jamel Dean is also good to go after a knee issue that cost him an early exit from the Bucs-Panthers game in Week 17 and a missed game Sunday. Second-year cornerback Josh Hayes filled in. Hayes was better than usual, but Joe is every happy to hear Dean and his load of experience will be back on the field against the Commanders this weekend. The Bucs’ secondary needs all the help it can get. Regarding No. 1 tight end Cade Otton and his knee injury, Bowles was unsure about Sunday. “Cade is trending the right way – we’ll see how he recovers,” he said.|2025-01-10 14:35:00|156|24|7|Jamel Dean And Antoine Winfield|Jr.|5|Mixed sentiments with excitement, frustration, optimism, and some negative comments about team performance.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Crickett Baker"", ""post"": ""GO BUCS!

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/mike-evans-bucs-absolutely-a-super-bowl-team/|Mike Evans: Bucs “Absolutely” A Super Bowl Team|The greatest offensive player in Buccaneers history has spoken. Mike Evans didn’t drop any one-game-at-a-time chatter yesterday when asked if the Bucs have what it takes to be in the Super Bowl this season. “Absolutely. Absolutely,” Evans said. “So we’ve got to come out here and put on a good show.” Evans went on to say he believes the best team does usually win it all and flukes aren’t a part of the playoffs. Being hot is key, Evans added, noting the Bucs have won 6 of 7 games and are hot like they were entering the 2020 postseason. Joe loves the confidence. The Bucs have players who know what it takes to get to the ultimate dance, so Joe thinks Evans is being genuine. The Bucs are at least capable if their offense is truly humming on all cylinders, Joe believes. Simply stated, the Bucs can outscore anyone, which gives them a chance.|2025-01-10 11:09:00|154|38|9|Mike Evans|Bucs confident in Super Bowl run.|1|Mixed sentiments on defense, offense, and playoffs with a focus on improvement and potential.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Tye"", ""post"": ""Totally agree\u2026.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/the-secondary-stinks/|“The Secondary Stinks”|An old Bucs assistant coach and a 2020 and 2021 Buccaneer pulled no punches this week.  Joe’s noticed a common theme among national media types. If they don’t watch the Bucs closely, they rave about the Tampa Bay offense and its ability to outscore teams in many ways while glossing over the Bucs’ defensive struggles by saying something like, “Todd Bowles always has a good plan.” For those who watch more closely, they’re nearly ill watching the Bucs’ pass defense each week and aren’t shy about sharing their feelings. Retired Bucs offensive lineman (2020) and assistant coach (2021) A.Q. Shipley, a true Tampa Bay supporter, expressed his disgust this week on the Clean Pocket podcast. “The secondary stinks,” Shipley said. That comment came after Jay Gruden, Chucky’s brother and a former Bucs assistant coach, said of the Bucs’ defensive backfield. “I really think their secondary is awful.” Gruden thinks the Commanders will do everything they can Sunday to be aggressive on first down, attacking the Bucs secondary and putting rookie QB Jayden Daniels in more positions to run. Daniels is the Commanders leading rusher and he set the NFL record for rushing by a rookie QB this season. Shipley added that the Bucs should be very scared of Washington because they’ll find “scoring opportunties everywhere” if they can do just an OK job picking up the array of Bowles blitzes. The Commanders’ offense will be aggressive trying to avoid 3rd-and-long, Gruden noted, so Bowles can’t drop the exotic blitzes that Washington couldn’t handle in Week 1. Joe loves this matchup because it’s so even. Stressful but fun because both teams are winning and have great strengths with clear weaknesses. Shipley picked the Bucs to win on the back of their offense; Gruden picked the Commanders, though he’s a huge Baker Mayfield fan and is concerned Washington’s shaky kicking game will bite them in the butt. Sunday night has all the makings of a wild roller coaster ride.|2025-01-10 10:48:00|327|42|3|The Secondary|Concerns about Bucs' poor pass defense and upcoming matchup.|4|Mixed sentiments about the defense with some optimism and skepticism about potential outcomes.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""TheBucsAnthem"", ""post"": ""Shipley is 100% correct\u2026\u2026."", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""10th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""10:57"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""ElioT"", ""post"": ""They\u2019re not wrong.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/liam-coen-said-baker-mayfield-is-locked-in-to-rock-sunday-night/|Liam Coen Said Baker Mayfield Is Locked In To Rock Sunday Night|Liam Coen can feel it. And it’s not because he had too many onions on his cheesesteak. Yesterday the Bucs’ savvy offensive coordinator was asked how he can rein in his quarterback, Baker Mayfield, from maybe being too stoked for a game. Coen doesn’t want to. In fact, Coen said Mayfield is fully dialed in as the Bucs prep for the Commandos to kick off the postseason Sunday night at The Licht House. “He was pretty intense the last few days,” Coen said with a smile. “That’s a good thing, I think, when he’s truly like he is in terms of asking questions quickly, [being] on it. “You can feel it, just the way he was throwing the ball in a walk-through where we’re not supposed to be throwing the ball, or just when we’re doing some jog-through stuff out here. He wants to go full speed. “That’s a good thing – to get him going. His mindset is in the right place. How do we kind of hold that in a little bit as we get towards Sunday night?” Joe sure hopes that attitude rubs off on the rest of the Bucs. If Mayfield is chomping at the bit, Joe hopes the rest of his teammates are, too. Then, let loose so much that the Commandos won’t even be in the mood for Tulum next week.|2025-01-10 09:00:00|227|32|8|Baker Mayfield|Mayfield is focused and intense for upcoming postseason game.|4|Mixed sentiment towards team performance, focusing on Baker Mayfield, Mike Evans, and defense concerns.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Bucnjim"", ""post"": ""Looking forward to seeing Baker in action Sunday night.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/jalen-mcmillan-and-jamarr-chase/|Jalen McMillan And Ja’Marr Chase|As much as Joe likes Mike Evans, if Joe had to pick the best receiver in the game, Joe would have to think long and hard about choosing Ja’Marr Chase of the Bengals. That guy is otherworldly and might be the only receiver Joe would take over Evans. It’s really close. Now Joe can just hear Jalen McMillan yelling in the background, “Hold up!” Is Joe trying to say McMillan, the Bucs’ fabulous rookie receiver, is better than Evans? Calm down. However, McMillan pulled off something the past five weeks that only Chase has done this season: catch seven touchdown catches. That’s nuts. And in Joe’s mind the best thing about this? McMillan has become red hot right at the perfect time: the playoffs are about to start. Perfect timing.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/chris-simms-brock-purdy-not-even-close-to-as-good-as-baker-mayfield/|Chris Simms: Brock Purdy “Not Even Close To As Good As Baker Mayfield”|One quarterback has taken his team to overtime in a Super Bowl and his worst season was losing in the NFC title game, all in his first two seasons. The other is still looking for his first conference title appearance. But former Bucs quarterback Chris Simms would take the guy with less postseason success in a heartbeat over the guy who has enjoyed nothing but playoff success (until this year). That would be 49ers quarterback Brock Purdy and Baker Mayfield. Of course, Purdy is the guy that came this-close to the ultimate quarterback glory last year. Simms thinks the two quarterbacks are worlds apart and he would take Mayfield over Purdy in a heartbeat. Simms joined his partner in crime, the creator, curator and overall guru of Pro Football Talk, the great Mike Florio, to discuss how much Purdy might be worth on the open market. For reasons Joe is not quite clear, a lot of NFL people simply do not respect Purdy one bit. Count Simms in this group as he said he’d pay Mayfield much more than Purdy to play for him. Purdy is entering a contract year with San Francisco in 2025. “If I’m the 49ers, I’m offering $30 million. I’m offering $25 million,” Simms said passionately. “Baker Mayfield is making [$30 million]. You’re not even close to as good as Baker Mayfield. Sorry.” It’s an interesting point. Purdy has had more postseason success than Mayfield that’s where quarterbacks make their bones. Eli Manning gets serious discussions among Ira Kaufman and his Pro Football Hall of Fame selectors gang. And it’s not so much what he did on the field, but what he did in the postseason. Take away Manning’s rings and you’re left with Jim Hart. That’s why it cracks Joe up to hear some people squeal about Lamar Jackson so much they pitch a tent. Yet Jackson, for all his regular-season hardware and viral highlights, has no more postseason wins than Mayfield. Meanwhile, Mayfield’s personality rubs off on his teammates in a good way and he energizes the rest of the team with gutsy play. What does Purdy inspire the 49ers to do, go get a vanilla milkshake after the game? Joe likes Purdy but he’s about as inspirational as a house plant.|2025-01-10 03:45:00|378|24|5|Chris Simms|Simms prefers Baker Mayfield over Brock Purdy in NFL analysis.|5|Mixed opinions on various QBs, with some praise and some criticism.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""adam from ny"", ""post"": ""aaron rodgers can wind up in sf\u2026"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""10th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""4:08"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""garro"", ""post"": ""Slow news day indeed when Simms\u2019 opinion on a QB, especially Purdy is somehow newsworthy\u2026Geez!"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""10th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""4:34"", ""am""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""heyjude"", ""post"": ""Good for Chris Simms.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/yahoo-liam-coen-might-want-to-pass-on-this-coaching-cycle/|Yahoo!: Liam Coen Might Want To Pass On This Coaching Cycle|The Bucs may very well have hit the lottery when they signed Liam Coen as offensive coordinator. Joe doesn’t think there is any Bucs fan that thought Coen — or anyone short of Don Coryell — would turn around the Bucs offense like this, never mind the run game. It’s why some folks think Coen was the best offensive coach in the NFL this past year. Hard to argue otherwise. As with other successful coordinators, NFL teams come calling. It’s just a matter of time before Coen is a head coach somewhere. “This Joe” predicted next season and will stick to his prediction, if for no other reason than stubbornness. Selfishly, of course, Joe wants Coen to stick around. So with NFL teams already in the middle of coaching searches, Frank Schwab of Yahoo! Sports thinks Coen (and a few other coordinators) may be smart to sit this coaching cycle out. Why? There are major pitfalls with each opening, Schwab types. To summarize, here is why Schwab thinks coaching candidates ought to say, “Thanks, but no thanks” to teams with vacancies. Bears: Trainwreck of an organization. Sure they’ve got a quarterback and maybe some decent weapons but that roster is otherwise bereft of talent. And with the hierarchy, run by a 101-year old woman, can that organization be trusted to bring in talent to build a winner? Given the history of the franchise the past half-century (sans a blip in 2006), that’s a bad gamble. Patriots: (See: Bears) New England has a good young quarterback but a fully empty roster save a player or three. Joe believes this is better than the Bears gig because the Krafts have built a solid organization, unlike the McCaskey clan in Chicago. Slimy Saints: Aging roster and really no quarterback to build around. Raiders: No quarterback or general manager, unless Tom Brady is running the show (quite possible). Even that is a leap of faith. But yeah, you are working in Vegas, so that’s a major plus, for the two or three years you’ll live there. Jags: You may or may not have a quarterback. You have a clown for a general manager who nobody likes. And an owner who is fully inept and is the modern-day version of Bill Bidwill. Jets: They’re the Jets. Ask Todd Bowles. Joe still is worried about the Patriots. Coen is from there, again, the Patriots have a very good organization and Creepy Bob Kraft is a strong owner. Throw in the fact that Coen is from Rhode Island, that’s going to pull at Coen’s heartstrings if Kraft comes calling. So let’s cross our fingers. Let’s hope Schwab is correct and that no openingts are attractive enough for Coen to back up the U-Haul.|2025-01-10 00:00:00|456|34|8|Liam Coen|Yahoo article on coaching cycle skepticism|5|Mixed opinions on Coen's future as head coach, optimistic about team potential, wary of competition.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Jethro Tull"", ""post"": ""The Glazers didn\u2019t let Koetter go anywhere after 2016 where JaMiss actually played like a promising, developing QB.
