https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/dont-put-all-your-eggs-in-that-basket/|“Don’t Put All Your Eggs In That Basket”|Bucky fever hasn’t found its way to one prominent Tampa Bay fan who used to wear a Bucs uniform. Joe is almost in disbelief after hearing what former Bucs guard Ian Beckles (1990-1996) was saying about electric Bucs rookie running back Bucky Irving. Irving has yet to miss a game but Beckles says Irving’s various injuries are a massive red flag and fans might want to dial back the hype. “You think at this time next year we’re still going to be talking about Bucky Irving, a guy who’s a rookie and has had back injuries and hip injuries and foot injuries? Alone they’re all terrible,” Beckles said on his In The Trenches podcast via YouTube. “All together? Don’t put all your eggs in that basket. “Is he talented, yes? … Bucky’s not durable. You didn’t finish two games in a row and I’m to believe going down the way he’s going to be available in the playoffs? You’ve never played football then. It don’t get easier as the weeks go along.” Joe has a big “C’mon, man” for Beckles. Let’s see if Irving grinds through his injuries down the stretch before judging his durability. Beckles referenced Irving being a smaller running, which he is, of course. But Joe’s seen plenty of second-year running backs in Irving’s size range explode in their second seasons. Former Falcons RB Devonta Freeman comes to mind as does Tarik Cohen  of the Bears in the past decade. Freeman, at 5-8, 205 pounds, was a beast for a few years. Irving was 5-9, 192 pounds at the NFL Scouting Combine. No, Joe’s not putting every egg in Irving’s basket, but the guy is a hell of a versatile talent.|2024-12-13 12:44:00|284|46|4|Bucky Irving|Concerns raised about rookie Bucs running back's durability and potential.|3|Mixed reactions to Bucky's durability and role, with concerns about injury potential and usage patterns.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""rrsrq"", ""post"": ""I remember watching Bucky at Oregon and I would say \u201d I wish the Bucs had a RB that could break tackles and make people miss like Irving\u201d.

What will be interesting is who may not play. Bowles said running back Bucky Irving and defensive back Christian Izien are questionable. Bowles added that Irving and Izien will get a test run on the turf of SoFi Stadium to see if they can suit up. In other words, gametime decision. Joe would seriously worry about not having any (decent) safeties to battle Justin Herbert, but Herbert himself is beat up.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/bucs-will-get-chances-to-score/|Bucs Will Get Chances To Score|There is a line of thinking out there — Chip Kelly subscribes to this so not sure it’s the way to go — that the quicker an offense runs, the more chances there are to score. More plays, more possessions, more chances. Well, the Bucs ought to have plenty of possessions on Sunday. The Bucs can move the ball. In fact, 33 of the Bucs’ possessions ended in goal-to-go situations. That’s second-best in the league, trailing only Detroit. So why is Joe convinced the Bucs will get a lot of possessions on Sunday? Per Rich Hribar of Sharp Football Analysis, 41.1 percent of the Chargers possessions fail to gain a first down, ahead of only the Jaguars (41.8 percent). And with Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert beat up, maybe Los Angeles struggles more than usual to move the chains?|2024-12-13 11:45:00|138|23|8|Bucs|Bucs likely to have many scoring opportunities against Chargers.|2|Responses range from concern over Herbert's injury to confidence in Todd Bowles' coaching abilities.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""First Last"", ""post"": ""Justin Herbert is incredibly banged up and without good weapons.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/49ers-loss-helped-bucs-playoff-chances/|49ers’ Loss Helped Bucs’ Playoff Chances|Lots of mathematics flowing this time of year in NFL circles. The world of calculating Wild Card and division title tiebreakers is in full swing. So last night the 49ers and Rams played an ugly game with Los Angeles (8-6) winning the NFC West rivalry 12-6. That loss by San Francisco (6-8) put more distance between them and the Bucs in a potential chase for the final NFC Wild Card seed. The 49ers own a head-to-head tiebreaker against the Bucs after beating them Nov. 10 at The Licht House. (The Niners have lost four out of their last five since). The major-media data nerds that calculate probabilites for all teams reaching the postseason bumped up the Bucs’ chances after last night. NextGen stats at NFL.com now has the Bucs with a 72 percent chance at reaching the postseason. The New York Times upped Tampa Bay’s postseason shot to 70 percent with a 62 percent shot at a division crown. The 49ers’ remaining three games are against the Dolphins, Lions and Cardinals with only Detroit at home. Ouch! Yes, the Bucs (7-6) will be in excellent shape if they can win three of their next four games. Joe has high hopes, including the No. 3 seed that’s in play for Tampa Bay.|2024-12-13 10:34:00|211|24|6|49ers|49ers’ loss benefits Bucs' playoff chances in tight race.|5|Mixed sentiments, ranging from optimistic to pessimistic, unsure about playoffs, critical of coaching.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""gp"", ""post"": ""Just win baby!"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""13th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""10:46"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""#1bucsfan"", ""post"": ""While for some it\u2019s fun to look ahead but I hope the Bucs are focus just solely on the chargers.

Shipley: The Bucs “Are Running The Sh!t Out Of The Ball”|Former Bucs Super Bowl-winning offensive lineman and former Bucs assistant offensive line coach A.Q. Shipley likes what he sees when he watches the 2024 Bucs offensive line go to work. Shipley does a weekly segment on “The Pat McAfee Show” breaking down offensive line play around the league. This week he highlighted the Bucs and fully enjoyed watching their line pound people. “They are running the sh!t out of the ball,” Shipley said. “They are doing some very good things.” Shipley rattled off stats for which the Bucs are among the league leaders. He seemed in disbelief that the Bucs are just 7-6. Shipley suggested teams with those kinds of offensive stats are usually dominant. However, Shipley is also frustrated with the Bucs. He believes they are playing much better than their record suggests. And he fingers the culprit. “They have all makings to be great,” Shipley said. “They are just losing it on defense. The defense is losing some games. That’s the difference.” Shipley also pointed out that when the Bucs have Tristan Wirfs pull on a run play, defenders see that big ol’ truck barreling down on them and they quickly make business decisions or go for cheap shots on Wirfs’ legs. It’s all in the video linked above. Enjoy! Joe did.|2024-12-13 10:00:00|214|12|8|A.Q.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/jason-licht-believes-offensive-line-is-the-core-reason-for-bucs-success/|Jason Licht: Offensive Line Is Core Reason For Bucs’ Success|Here’s a wild stat. This week, Bucs AC/DC-loving general manager Jason Licht appeared on “Schein on Sports” hosted by Adam Schein, heard weekdays on “Mad Dog Radio” exclusively on SiriusXM. There, Schein hit Licht with this nutso stat: The Bucs are tied for most 400-yard games by an offense this season. Schein wanted Licht’s reaction and of course, Licht mentioned Baker Mayfield. But Licht, an old offensive lineman for Tom Osborne at Nebraska, seemed to think it is the Bucs’ offensive line that makes the offense, including Mayfield, hum. “I’m going to have to give the offensive line a lot of credit here. I think we have one of the better offensive lines,” Licht said. “We have a lot of cornerstone players up there if not a future Hall of Fame player in Tristan [Wirfs] and other Pro Bowl-caliber players. “That [offensive line] room is like the central command of this organization. Because if you can protect the quarterback and run the football, which we are doing a great job of right now, then your quarterback has a fighting chance and a chance to win games.” Licht also emphasized that Mayfield is beloved in and out of One Buc Palace. …”[Mayfield is] the type of player — you know, I get it all over town,” Licht said. “Fans just love Baker. You see a lot of Baker jerseys. … But just like the fans love him, the players love him.” Joe agrees with Licht on the strength of the offensve line. Though Bucky Irving can make dudes miss, how much would his production be reduced if Irving made the first guy miss but the second guy is already on top of him? Pass blocking? Like Joe’s old man always said, starting quarterbacks in the NFL are the best in the world at what they do. Give them time and they will hurt you.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/fixing-rachaad-white/|Fixing Rachaad White|Joe usually has a different take from the majority of Bucs fans when it comes to two aspects of the team. The first is the Bucs’ offensive line. There is little if anything to whine about the Bucs’ offensive line now, but Joe has been a huge supporter of the offensive line for many years. Joe never wanted to run Donovan Smith and Robert Hainsey out of Tampa like so many fans. And Joe didn’t have a panic attack when Luke Goedeke struggled early in his rookie season. Joe has fully different standards for what is good or bad with an offensive line than a lot of fans. If there aren’t five pancake blocks on every series, Joe is convinced many fans holler and stomp about how godawful a line is. The other element is running backs. Oh, Bucky Irving might be the best Bucs’ best draft pick in a while. When is the last time a third-day draft pick has had this kind of rookie impact? Tanard Jackson? But when it came to Ronald Jones and Rachaad White, and Doug Martin after 2015, Joe is like a salmon swimming against the tide. Hell, in 2016, Joe once took a phone call on the road in a stadium press box from a Bucs fan threatening to beat Joe up for his anti-Martin stance. A few hours later, Martin was a healthy scratch in a key game because, as it turned out, he was ingesting something the NFL bans players from ingesting. Last year, Joe was fully fed up with White as a runner while maintaining White is one of the best receivers out of the backfield in the league (though Irving has better receiving numbers this year). White’s advanced rushing stats were downright terrible. But boy, writing about that really rubbed many fans the wrong way. They loved White (and probably still do). This year? Joe thinks White has turned into a tough runner. He may rarely get breakaway runs but his short runs last week against Las Vegas were tough runs. Physical. Hard-earned like a fullback. White used to be terrible running between the tackles. Not so any longer. Yesterday, Bucs offensive coordinator Liam Coen discussed how when he arrived in Tampa, an assignment was given to him: Awaken White’s inner running back. Make White more decisive. “That has been an emphasis since we got here,” Coen said. “We’ve had a lot of meetings and conversations and film sessions with Rachaad, showing him where we think he could take the next step. “He’s been bought into that, he’s understood that can help him in his game and as well as, in the same term, help us and help us run the football more effectively.” Coen admitted that yes, he has changed how the Bucs block up front. Sometimes, Coen said, running backs perform better behind specific blocking techniques. He seems to think what the Bucs do now is better suited for White, and that’s one reason why his running has improved. Hearing Coen talk, Joe couldn’t help but think of Todd Monken, the only offensive coordinator Dirk Koetter had with the Bucs (2016-2018). Monken has said he was given a direct command, a critical assignment when Koetter hired him: “Fix Mike Evans.” Joe thinks it is safe to say Monken, now the offensive coordinator of the Crows, aced that test.|2024-12-13 07:00:00|561|32|7|Rachaad White|Joe expresses evolving opinions on Bucs' offensive line and running backs.|6|Mixed opinions on player improvement, coaching impact, and running game effectiveness.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""AlabamaBucsFan"", ""post"": ""I will be the first to admit, I wanted to run out both Rachaad White and Robert Hainsey at the end of last season.

Think about it: Last week Los Angeles played Kansas City. The Chargers still had a prayer of winning the division. So you know they put in 100 percent preparation and effort. No, the Chargers didn’t win. In fact, their star quarterback Justin Herbert got beat up with a leg injury. And he sprained another ankle. Chargers coach Jim Harbaugh is convinced Justin Herbert will play against the Bucs. But what about four days later? Los Angeles hosts Denver, Thursday Night Football. Both teams are currently 8-5. The Chargers beat the Broncos earlier in the year. Beating the Broncos would give the Chargers a playoff tiebreaker. So that’s an important game. Now Joe knows no matter how much coaches will deny it, they pay attention to a Thursday night game a week out. Some teams will even split time to go over gameplans in practice with their teams for an upcoming Thursday game while also preparing for Sunday. Yes, Sunday is important for both the Bucs and the Chargers. But with the Chargers playing the Bucs sandwiched by two serious division rivals with a tiebreaker at stake in the span of 11 days, and having a quarterback limping around, might the Bucs catch a break with perhaps Los Angeles looking ahead?

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/liam-coen-says-jalen-mcmillan-is-turning-the-corner/|Liam Coen Says Jalen McMillan Is Turning The Corner|No Bucs player seemed to be hyped more than Jalen McMillan in underwear football. That’s always dangerous because receivers playing well in underwear football can be giant mirages. Just ask Kenny Bell and Tommy Streeter. In the season-opener, McMillan caught one pass, a touchdown. Sweet play. Got wide ass open. Good job. Since, McMillan has pretty much been a non-factor if not in the witness protection program. He never had more than 35 yards receiving in a game. Not good for an alleged No. 3 receiver, especially when both Mike Evans and Chris Godwin were out. That changed Sunday. McMillan had two touchdown catches and 59 yards on four catches. Pretty good. Yesterday, Bucs offensive coordinator Liam Coen said there is a reason for that. Coen noted McMillan is getting better, a little every week. Now, Coen believes McMillan has reached a level at which he can be banked on more. “I think [two touchdowns against the Raiders] was big for his confidence,” Coen said. “You’ve just seen him each week play a little bit better and a little bit better. That’s the guy we’ve wanted to be out there, and he’s starting to prove it. He’s starting to show it. “Sometimes it takes a little bit longer or a different timeline, but I’ve been really happy with his energy, his level of focus, and concentration throughout practices and walkthroughs. “You can see that there’s always been a natural connection between [Baker Mayfield and McMillan]. Hopefully, we can continue to evolve that deal.” Well, now is the time to evolve. When the Bucs play the Chargers on Sunday, it will be the middle of December. This is when teams need to be in overdrive, especially the Bucs. While the Bucs are in first place, it’s not safe. One slip up and the Bucs are tied again with the Dixie Chicks and Atlanta owns the tiebreaker. If McMillan really is about to break out, the middle of December in the middle of a playoff race is the time to do it.|2024-12-13 00:00:00|340|25|5|Jalen McMillan|McMillan showing improvement|4|Mixed opinions on players' performances, with some optimism and some concerns expressed.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""adam from ny"", ""post"": ""ok so let\u2019s see this corner turned in san diego\u2026"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""13th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""12:02"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""BillyBucco"", ""post"": ""I don\u2019t think hurdling a defender qualifies as \u201c Tentative \u201c."", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""13th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""12:42"", ""am""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""Brian in St Pete"", ""post"": ""We all want these rookies to be an all-pro week 1 but it just isn\u2019t realistic.
