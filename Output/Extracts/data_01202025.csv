https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/bears-to-hire-ben-johnson-as-head-coach/|Bears To Hire Ben Johnson As Head Coach; Liam Coen Gets Second Interview In Jacksonville|UPDATED 6:05 p.m. So another NFL head coach opening has been filled, per multiple reports. Lions offensive coordinator Ben Johnson is finalizing a deal to become the Bears’ new head coach. Who cares, Joe? Well, Johnson interviewed for the Jaguars head coach opening and so did Bucs offensive coordinator Liam Coen. So a Coen path for that gig has one less hurdle. The Jaguars still have interest in Coen. Jordan Schultz of FOX Sports reported this evening that Coen will have a second interview in Jacksonville this week. Head coach openings remain for the Cowboys, Jets, Jags, Saints and Raiders. Coen has interviewed only for the Jags gig, per various reports. Eight candidates other than Coen and Johnson interviewed for the Jags job. They include Bills playcaller Joe Brady, Vikings defensive coordinator Brian Flores, Philadelphia Eagles offensive coordinator Kellen Moore, Baltimore Ravens offensive coordinator Todd Monken, Lions defensive coordinator Aaron Glenn, Kansas City Chiefs defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo and Raiders defensive coordinator Patrick Graham. Fired former Jets head coach Robert Saleh also has a second interview scheduled this week, per ESPN.|2025-01-20 17:08:00|181|82|5|Ben Johnson|NFL head coach hiring updates.|6|Mixed feelings about Coen and Bowles, uncertainty about future coaching, some support for continuity.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Winny Testaverde"", ""post"": ""I think it\u2019s now greater than 50/50 that the Jags hire Coen.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/mike-evans-no-65/|Mike Evans No. 65|Where would the Bucs be without Mike Evans? In a damn pinch, that’s where. Evans, who turns 32 in August, is still one of the best receivers in the game and clearly the best Bucs receiver. Despite missing three games and most of a fourth, Evans ranked 24th in receiving yards this year. More than Tee Higgins, DeVonta Smith and Cooper Kupp. Of course, we all know Evans had 1,000 yards receiving. Again. BSPN’s Seth Walder, a man who never met a number he didn’t like, ranked Evans as the No. 65 most valuable player in the NFL. Without Evans (and Chris Godwin), the Bucs plunged into a four-game losing streak. The offense was OK without the duo for a couple of games, but by the time the 49ers game rolled around it was clear the Bucs offense missed Evans a lot. With Evans in the lineup after the bye, the Bucs finished the season on a 6-1 run clinching the playoffs on the final day of the regular season. Quite simply, the Bucs would not have made the playoffs without Evans. And Joe doesn’t think Liam Coen interviews with the Jags without Evans returning. Yeah, Evans is that valuable.|2025-01-20 14:00:00|200|17|9|Mike Evans|Vital role in Bucs' success|5|Mixed sentiment with optimism about player performance and disappointment over not making playoffs.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""SB~LV"", ""post"": ""Hence the need to bring in draft talent LB3"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""20th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""2:12"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Crickett Baker"", ""post"": ""Hence the joy he plays next season!"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""20th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""2:17"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""SlyPirate"", ""post"": ""Evans looked great when healthy.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/john-spytek-closer-to-tom-brady-than-you-may-think/|John Spytek Is Closer To Tom Brady Than You May Think|A couple of weeks ago this popped on Joe’s radar. And Joe is much more frightened about it now than previously after reading the following item. Tom Brady is running the football operations in Las Vegas until he hires a general manager. A fair amount of folks connected dots between Brady and one of Bucs AC/DC-loving general manager Jason Licht’s right-hand men, John Spytek. Brady and Spytek were teammates at Michigan. It seems the connection is much deeper. Brady interviewed Spytek for the general manager gig with the Raiders and per well-plugged-in Albert Breer of SI.com, who closely follows the Patriots and ex-Patriots (and the way he has Josh McDaniels’ back, maybe he covers them too closely?). Breer seems to think Spytek is a finalist for the Raiders gig and probably Brady’s No. 2 pick. Part of Breer’s read is that Spytek is extremely tight with Brady. In fact, Brady knows first-hand how well Spytek scouts players and teams, not just because Brady and Spytek collected checks from Team Glazer. If it’s not [Lance] Newmark, I’d keep an eye on Tampa Bay Buccaneers assistant GM John Spytek for the Raiders’ job. He was with Brady for three years in Tampa, and was the point man in running the Tuesday scouting-the-opponent meetings Brady carried with him from New England (where Belichick and later Caserio ran those meetings). So Brady met with Spytek weekly to go over opponents. Thus, few outside of Team Glazer and Licht know Spytek’s read on teams and players better than Brady. And here’s another reason you may want to have a strong cocktail for lunch. Spytek knows Bucs offensive coordinator Liam Coen intimately. NFL suits love coaches who develop their draft picks. And look what Coen did with three Bucs rookies this season. That makes suits look real smart. Buys them job security, which in Spytek’s case could help him rake in millions of Mark Davis’ loot. If Spytek bolts for Las Vegas, then Joe can see him dragging Coen with him.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/paying-ben-bredeson/|Paying Ben Bredeson?|So the 16th-highest paid guard in the NFL this season (as of late August) is a former Buccaneer. No, not Alex Cappa of the Bengals. Joe’s referring to 31-year-old Shaq Mason, who earned $11.7 million in the midst of a multi-year contract with the Houston Texans. Joe brings this up because starting Bucs left guard Ben Bredeson, who turns 27 next month, is a pending free agent coming off a strong season that showcased his durability. Do the Bucs want Bredeson back for 2025? Of course. Why wouldn’t they? Coaches and personnel types love stability and continuity on an offensive line, and Bredeson is likely entering his prime after not playing a ton early in his career with the Ravens and Giants. But are the Bucs willing to play Bredeson the $10 million-plus per season he’s likely to command? The Joe typing here would trust Buccaneers Ring of Honor general manager Jason Licht to replace Bredeson with a cheaper alternative or a top draft pick and use the saved money to fortify the Bucs defense. That’s no knock on Bredeson, but Joe doesn’t think re-signing Bredeson is in the slam-dunk category.|2025-01-20 10:00:00|191|41|3|Ben Bredeson|Bucs evaluating re-signing Bredeson amid financial considerations.|2|Majority sentiment leans towards uncertainty and skepticism about re-signing Bredeson due to performance concerns.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""KnoxvilleBuc"", ""post"": ""I wouldn\u2019t be upset if we lost him but continuity on the Line is huge.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/it-sped-up-the-entire-cycle/|“It Sped Up The Entire Cycle'”|So ESPN NFL super insider Adam Schefter was on TV yesterday talking about a changed landscape in the world of head coach openings. Bucs fans are paying attention, worried about losing one of their own. Tampa Bay offensive coordinator Liam Coen was interviewed by Jacksonville for their head coach opening, among many other candidates, and it’s assumed that he was impressive. And some anonmous reports say Coen was. Schefter reported yesterday that the loss of the Lions to the Commanders on Sunday night was unexpected by NFL owners seeking a new head coach. So Lions playcaller Ben Johnson and defensive coordinator Aaron Glenn, with newfound freedom to interview without restriction, have “sped up the entire cycle” of head coach hiring, per Schefter. Glenn and Johnson are both potential Jaguars hires, Schefter said, noting Johnson is deciding between the Bears, Raiders and Jaguars. It’s not sounding great for Coen leaving Tampa, though it certainly remains possibility. (Schefter’s video report is below).

In addition to Suh’s many superstar seasons, including three in Tampa, Suh was known as a fitness freak at his defensive tackle position. In his first 12 seasons, Suh never missed a game because of injury, only suspension. Vea returned from his time with Suh looking a lot leaner. Bucs officials raved that he was quicker and better prepared for the 2024 season. Yeah, Vea gained back most or all of the weight during the season, but he had a very good year. Joe was pleased to learn from defensive line coach Kacy Rodgers, per the Buccaneers Radio Network, that Vea is heading back to train with Suh this winter. And this time he’s bringing a friend: fellow Bucs defensive tackle Calijah Kancey. What an incredible learning opportunity for Kancey! With the Rams, Suh went to a Super Bowl alongside Aaron Donald, a legend to whom Kancey often is compared.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/offense-should-not-be-a-priority-over-defesne/|Offense Should Not Be A Priority Over Defense|Joe doesn’t think there is a remote question about which side of the ball the Bucs need to focus on this offseason. And it ain’t the offense. There is nothing wrong with the offense unless you think Chris Godwin is going to escape when the free agency dinner bell rings in less than two months. The offense is set. Period. Every position is currently locked up, again, unless Godwin gets loose. But someone with the four-letter believes the Bucs’ biggest priority is on offense and that is Liam Coen. Biggest offseason priority: Solidify their offensive coordinator situation. In his first year with the Bucs, Liam Coen’s unit has averaged 28.6 points a game — second most in franchise history behind only the Super Bowl-winning 2020 team — and his name is generating buzz leaguewide for head coaching consideration. What is there to solidify? Coen, unless he takes a head coaching job, is under contract. And if you believe Dan Graziano of BSPN and Ian Rapoport of NFL Network, Coen is not a favorite to get a head coaching gig this year. Now, if something happens in the coming days where Coen has a second interview with another team, then yeah, it’s time for Team Glazer to spring into action, checkbook in hand. We aren’t there yet. That’s premature. But, goodness gracious, this pass defense needs work. To be fair, after seeing how the Commandos tore up the Lions on Saturday, the Bucs’ pass defense doesn’t look as bad as it did a week ago. Oh, the pass defense is still bad — at least compared to Detroit it’s not a full-blown sieve.|2025-01-20 07:00:00|272|46|4|Joe|Bucs offseason priority: defense over offense.|4|Comments vary in optimism/pessimism, with some focusing on defense and others on offensive improvement.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""OHBucFan"", ""post"": ""Focus of the draft: Best player available as long as its defense.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/a-better-defense-could-bring-huge-results/|A Better Pass Defense Could Bring Huge Results|Joe thinks the following items are correct and has a hunch most fans will agree. 1) The Bucs have a good offense. 2) The Bucs have a p!ss poor pass defense. As Evan Closky of WTSP-TV Channel 10 correctly pointed out the Bucs lost six games this past season by less than a touchdown. How many of those losses could have been wins with just an average pass defense, forget a good pass defense? Joe truly believes the Bucs offense will be better in 2025, barring injuries. It will possibly (likely?) be the second season with Liam Coen running the show. When the Bucs showed up for OTAs and underwear football last spring, everyone was learning the new offense. Well, these guys know the offense now. So the learning curve is nearly gone. But the pass defense. Joe is just too worn out and depressed about no edge rush. But the secondary outside of Zyon McCollum collectively stunk. For whatever reason, All-Pro safety Antoine Winfield was a shell of himself. He injured his foot in the season opener and after that Joe can only think of one big play he made after that. It was clearly his worst NFL season. Jordan Whitehead? Joe has not been told a word about Whitehead by anyone at One Buc Palace. But Joe is willing to bet if you injected a suit with truth serum, they would have buyer’s remorse. And Joe is nearly at the end of his rope with Jamel Dean. Unlike many fans, Joe doesn’t believe Dean is a bad player, he just cannot stay on the field. In each of the Bucs’ season-ending playoff losses the last three years, either Dean couldn’t finish the game with an injury, or wasn’t available because of an injury. If a guy cannot answer the bell in the playoffs, what’s the point? The Bucs must get a cornerback they can trust. The Bucs also will have a major hole at linebacker that could be the worst in the NFL if Lavonte David retires. So yeah, the Bucs have massive work to do in the second and third levels of the defense. Please don’t get Joe started about the invisible edge rush this early on a Monday morning. A better pass defense and the Bucs could do serious damage in the NFC.|2025-01-20 03:45:00|387|40|3|Joe|Bucs need major improvements in pass defense for success.|2|Mixed opinions on defense and coaching improvements, concerns about pass rush, turnovers, and injuries.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Steven #55"", ""post"": ""Pray LVD Returns Resign Godwin Draft LB then CB then LB again Get Free Agent Edge"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""20th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""4:16"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""bob in valrico"", ""post"": ""We need playmakers in the backend.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/you-got-some-extra-bag/|“You Got Some Extra Bag”|There was a hidden message behind the Bucs’ final win two weeks ago, when they took care of the slimy Saints and secured the NFC South title and a (short-lived) playoff berth. That was the message screamin’ Stephen A. Smith of BSPN wanted to get out to the nation. The Bucs take care of their own. When head coach Todd Bowles gave the Bucs the green light to throw to Mike Evans in the final secons so he could keep his 1,000-yard receiving streak alive, despite the game being a one-score contest, that opened people’s eyes. SAS believes the Bucs deserve a tip of the hat. “I’ve got to applaud the Buccaneers,” SAS said. “Especially the Baker Mayfields of the world and the rest of his teammates. “Not only did you get [Mike Evans] the record, but you got some extra bag. And they knew that. And they made sure they got it. Major props to all of them.” Evans also pocketed $3 million in bonus money as a result of that final pass. Players across the NFL see that. And when the free agency dinner bell rings in just over seven weeks, that could be a factor. Players (and agents) notice when teams go out of their way for players to achieve personal goals that are often tied to bonuses. Few NFL players ever see a third contract. So that extra effort by Bowles and the Bucs to make sure one of their players hits a big bonus, that goes a long way in recruiting. Players know the Bucs will take care of them.|2025-01-20 00:00:00|265|22|9|Mike Evans|Bucs care for players|3|Mixed feelings about team performance and player decisions.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""BallHawk75"", ""post"": ""Do players on the Bucs defense get bonuses for making Kirk Cousins look like Joe Montana?"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""20th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""12:17"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""firethecannons"", ""post"": ""It makes sense, it may help us in FA.
