https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/bucs-re-sign-cornerback-bryce-hall/|Bucs Re-Sign Cornerback Bryce Hall|This is exciting on two fronts. Bryce Hall will be a Buccaneers cornerback for the second consecutive season, per SiriusXM NFL Radio. Last year, he was a free agent signing by the Bucs (from the Jets) and dislocated his ankle in Week 1. That’s the same ugly injury Chris Godwin had. So it seems the Bucs are confident Hall is healed or is healing just right and will be ready for this season. That makes Joe feel a little more comfortable about Godwin’s readiness. Hall, 27, was once the Jets’ No. 1 corner in 2021 but stud the team adding Sauce Gardner and D.J. Reed knocked him out of their starting lineup. He’s got 26 career starts under his belt. The re-signing of Hall is obviously very inexpensive. He was earning near the veteran minimum last year. Interestingly, the Bucs also signed young veteran cornerback Kindle Vildor last week. Buccaneers Ring of Honor general manager Jason Licht is obviously loading up on experience. Maybe this means the Bucs are more likely to draft a cornerback in Round 1 and launch Jamel Dean? After all, Rondé Barber tipped a Bucs hand yesterday and cornerback was among the cards.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/the-bucs-donovan-ezeiruaku/|The Bucs & Donovan Ezeiruaku|There are a few guarantees when it comes to Joe.  One is that Joe will do nothing but stand and applaud whenever the Bucs draft an edge rusher. Yeah, the Bucs may not very good at that, but the modern game demands dangerous edge rushers. It’s easy to argue it’s the most important position on a defense. That’s why they’re paid so much damn money. The Bucs just signed beastly edge rusher Haason Reddick, who had a ghastly 2024 but is loaded with talent and stud seasons on his resume at 30 years old. They also have YaYa Diaby, a third-year edge rusher with elite talent, but his game has proven to be incomplete. There’s veteran Anthony Nelson in the stable, a solid backup but not a dangerous edge rusher. And they’ve got second-year man Chris Braswell. On the Ira Kaufman Podcast, Buccaneers Ring of Honor general manager Jason Licht said he’s confident Braswell with “shock” fans this season. So do the Bucs think they’re set at edge rusher? Former Eagles, Browns and Ravens scout Daniel Jeremiah, a former college QB, doesn’t think so. The NFL Network draft guru believes the Bucs will go edge rusher in Round 1 at pick No. 19, per his latest mock draft. He’s got the Bucs taking Donovan Ezeiruaku out of Boston Collee. “Bucs GM Jason Licht has always valued production, and Ezeiruaku brings exactly that to the table with 16.5 sacks last season. He’s one of the most gifted pass rushers in the draft,” Jeremiah wrote. Jeremiah has said many times he bases his drafts on what he’s hearing and scouting. Joe’s not going to call edge rusher a major Bucs need, but again, Joe would applaud drafting Ezeiruaku. Hey, the Rams are ecstatic after drafting defensive rookie of the year Jared Verse at No. 19 last season. The next edge rusher off the board, Chop Robinson, had a very strong season finish for the Dolphins (6 sacks in his final 10 games). Yes, first-round rookie edge rushers sometimes make an impact late in their rookie years. (The other three edge rushers taken in last year’s first round did not have special seasons). At 6-2, 248 pounds, Ezeiruaku is a small edge rusher, but he’s got superior athleticism (a former track star) and Joe likes that he’s still just 21 years old. The former Boston College captain surely will add man strength and weight next season. If the Bucs think he’s the best available player on the board, then he’d be hard to pass up.|2025-03-18 14:55:00|422|42|5|Donovan Ezeiruaku|Bucs consider drafting talented edge rusher Donovan Ezeiruaku.|4|Mixed opinions on drafting edge rusher, focus on defense and need for leadership and depth.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""GoneGator"", ""post"": ""Yaya goes for double digits this year.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/lavonte-david-clarifies-decision-timeline-sort-of/|Lavonte David Clarifies Decision Timeline (Sort Of)|So when did Lavonte David decide he would play football in 2025? At the NFL Scouting Combine on Feb. 25, all Bucs officials were saying David was being given time to make a decision on returning to NFL for his 14th season. Yesterday, David was pressed by WDAE host Tom Krasniqi to tell fans when he actually decided he would return. David didn’t give an exact date and was fumbling for an answer, but he made it clear it was in February. (The following is David’s verbatim response, not evidence that Joe has been pounding beers and mauling plates of sushi all afternoon.) “Maybe towards middle of February, maybe? Maybe middle towards the end of middle February towards the end of February,” David replied. Did the Bucs really not know of David’s plans when they were at the Combine? Your guess is as good as Joes. The whole truth on anything is not something that flows freely at the Combine from any club. David said once he knew his (knee/ankle?)injury suffered late in the January playoff game wasn’t serious and his wellness and training team said his body still had the juice to perform at a high level, then he was ready to embrace the Bucs’ standing offer to return after a long look in the mirror. “Confident I’ll come back even better [than last year],” David said, adding that leaving Tampa is not an option. “It was Buccaneers or retirement … They’ve been loyal to me all these years, so I have to be loyal to them. … Loyal and transparent. I’ll always return the favor.”|2025-03-18 13:31:00|267|11|6|Lavonte David|David clarifies decision timeline|6|Mixed sentiments about Lavonte coverage, loyalty, retirement, and appreciation for players and the team.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""BigBucJoe"", ""post"": ""I love Lavonte, he\u2019s one of the greatest Bucs (and players) ever.

The new Bucs’ swing tackle is 6-8, 315 pounds and looks in fantastic shape. That’s one massive human being. Yesterday was the first time Heck, brought in last week in a free agent move, had met Wirfs. He was dumbstruck by Wirfs’ size. “Unbelievable,” Heck said of Wirfs. “I just saw him in the locker room – that dude is enormous. He’s unbelievable.” Heck was in awe of Wirfs from afar. Heck, who has learned to play both sides of the ball, marveled how Wirfs was the best right tackle in the game, flipped to left tackle, and now dominates there. “I mean, talk about somebody who was able to go from right tackle and then over to left, and he’s doing it at an All-Pro level,” Heck marveled. “So, I’m excited to be in an O-line room with somebody like that.” When Heck was asked what was special about Wirfs, he basically replied, you name it. “Size, strength, athletic ability,” Heck rattled off Wirfs’ attributes. “I mean, he’s one of those rare freaks that don’t come around often.” So let the record show: Wirfs isn’t only rare. He isn’t just a freak. He’s a rare freak, per Heck. Joe doesn’t think there is any question Wirfs is the best offensive lineman the team has ever had.|2025-03-18 09:00:00|240|31|8|Charlie Heck|Heck awed by size of Tristan Wirfs.|6|Mixed sentiments towards Wirfs and team, some positive and some critical comments.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""JimBobBuc"", ""post"": ""Wirfs\u2019 workout habits rubbed off on Goedeke and Mauch and we can see how those guys stepped up last year.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/without-trying-to-do-so-lavonte-david-made-his-case-for-the-pro-football-hall-of-fame/|Without Trying, Lavonte David Made His Case For The Pro Football Hall Of Fame|It really grinds Joe’s gears the way Lavonte David is shat on each and every year. Joe doesn’t give a rat’s rear end about the Pro Bowl but the guys and gals who vote on the Pro Football Hall of Fame value that dumbass game and use it to push for or run off Hall candidates. It’s an outage this is a criterion, but it is. And it’s a reason Joe gets steamed every year that David doesn’t get named to that waste of time and energy. Joe has maintained for years there is no more disrespected player in the league than David. Hell, he’s fifth in NFL history (since the NFL began keeping track of solo tackles in 1994) in most career solo tackles. And the guy can’t sniff the friggin’ Pro Bowl and never gets any run when Hall of Fame players come up. Criminal! Now yesterday at One Buc Palace, David was not asked about the Hall of Fame. He was asked how playing linebacker in the NFL has changed since he was drafted in 2012. David’s response was a helluva pitch for him being in the Pro Football Hall of Fame someday. “That’s something that I just started thinking about,” David said. “Somebody in my position playing inside linebacker who basically has to be the leader of the defense – the quarterback of the defense. “In my 14 years of playing, I’ve probably played with five defensive coordinators. [Joe’s note: Actually six.] Each defense, I adapted to it and I made it what’s good for me – I prevailed in each one. So, just adapting, taking what I learned from those defenses, and putting it into my game right now. “The game doesn’t change, people do the same thing but in different ways. Once you learn that and try to adjust to that, the game just slows down to you. It’s just fun to see all of that just come together – all of the things that you learn from your rookie year all the way until now and putting it into fruition and watch yourself and see your product on the field, how you’re moving through stuff like that and how you adapt to the game the way it’s played now. It’s a great feeling for you, personally.” And there you have it. It doesn’t matter if David played for Bill Sheridan or Leslie Frazier or lousy Lovie Smith or Mike Smith or Mark Duffner or Todd Bowles, he has adjusted, sometimes changed positions, given various responsibilities, and played elite football game in and game out for 13 years.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/bspn-best-nfl-move-was-bucs-signing-haason-reddick/|BSPN: Best NFL Move Was Bucs Signing Haason Reddick|It had gotten to the point Joe had to keep empty beer bottles away from his leather couch. The way the Bucs couldn’t get after a quarterback with an edge rusher made Joe want to grab anything within arm’s reach and rifle it at the TV. Good thing Joe can hide his remote during a Bucs game. It had reached a point where if Joe was a Glazer, he’d wing a chair from the owner’s suite onto the field, Bobby Knight-style. The lack of an edge rush was appalling and Joe really believed it was an albatross the team couldn’t overcome last season. Joe is still giddy and on Cloud 9 about the Bucs signing edge rusher Haason Reddick. In a lot of ways, Joe believes this is some cruel dream and won’t believe Reddick was signed until Joe actually witnesses Reddick throw Derek Carr to the turf of Lincoln’s Tomb in New Orleans. In fact, over at BSPN, Jeremy Fowler believes the Bucs signing Reddick was the best move any team made in free agency. Look, Joe had pointed out in many, many ways how an edge rush is so vital. There’s a reason why former NFL suits in the Pro Football Hall of Fame consistently have said a defensive end/edge rusher is the most important position on defense. Gil Brandt, the architect of the Cowboys, often said only a quarterback is more important than a defensive end. Also, Joe has pointed out too many times to count the Bucs in their franchise history only three times have had a feared pass rush (Lee Roy Selmon, Simeon Rice and Jason Pierre-Paul/Shaq Barrett). The worst those teams did was make an NFC title game (and held the Rams without a touchdown). That, boys and girls, is not a coincidence, that the most success the Bucs have had in their history was also the only times the team scared quarterbacks with an edge rush. Yeah, Joe still maintains the Bucs were an established edge rusher away from making a run at a Super Bowl. We’ll soon find out if Reddick has any more gas left in the tank.|2025-03-18 03:45:00|357|30|3|Haason Reddick|Bucs find hope in signing edge rusher Haason Reddick.|3|Mixed feelings about Reddick signing, cautious optimism and some skepticism.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Fred McNeil"", ""post"": ""I\u2019m not so sure what I make of Reddick just yet.

Thinking the Jets would give him the money he wanted, Reddick was shocked when the Jets refused. So Reddick held out, eventually signing a deal that cost him around 5 million in lost pay. Playing in 10 games for the Jets, he was able to get only one sack. Fast forward to now: The Bucs signed Reddick for a million less than his last year with the Eagles. On paper it looks good IF he can return to the form of his Eagles days when they thought him too old to keep. In 2024 there were 23 players with double digit sacks. Five were 30 or older.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/being-proactive-has-helped-lavonte-david-stay-on-the-field-and-stay-with-the-bucs/|Being Proactive Has Helped Lavonte David Stay On The Field And Stick With The Bucs|There may be a lesson here for a couple of other Bucs defenders. For Lavonte David, 35, to be entering his 14th season as one of the premier linebackers in the game, he first has to have good genes. David was asked yesterday at One Buc Palace what he does to keep himself physically healthy. Very rarely do you see David miss consecutive games. David said the trick for him is being proactive, no matter how small a bump or bruise may be. “I think the main thing for me is just taking care of things while it’s a little problem, before making it a big problem,” David said. Any time I feel any nicks or bumps, any small little thing, I try to get on top of it really fast so it doesn’t become a big problem. “Then, getting my conditioning level to where it needs to be and taking care of my body right away – eating right, doing what I’m supposed to be doing, being disciplined in all aspects. “I just feel like the off the field life when you’re disciplined, it [carries] over to the on the field life.” Joe took that last sentence to suggest that hitting the clubs today means hitting the unemployment line tomorrow. Joe has heard more and more the past few years about how diets have helped players gain longevity. We all know Tom Brady, who played until he was 45, was famously strict about his diet. You know, the famed avocado ice cream? (Anyone remember how Josh Freeman bragged he stopped at Taco Bell every day after practice? Then again, his problem wasn’t physical. His problem was between his ears.) Once upon a time players just gutted it out. As long as you were walking, you were fine and only the weaklings and attention hogs ran to the doctor. Now, with sports science and modern medicine, only the dumbarses try to act like the tough guy. And those are the guys who physically get worn down and are out of football before they hit 30.|2025-03-18 00:00:00|345|10|5|Lavonte David|Proactive approach to health and longevity in football career.|9|Positive sentiment towards Lavonte David and Tom Brady, mixed feelings about Josh Freeman.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Kieran"", ""post"": ""HOF awaits you legend."", ""post_time"": [""March"", ""18th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""2:45"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Lt.

Haven\u2019t heard much about him. "", ""post_time"": [""March"", ""19th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""5:03"", ""am""]}}"
