https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/shaq-barrett-wants-another-year/|Shaq Barrett Wants Another Year|So Bucs sacks king Shaq Barrett returned to Tampa Bay two months ago under desperate circumstances. The Bucs were desperate for a spark at edge rush and Shaq decided to unretire. He was welcomed back with open arms and made a few bucks over the final few weeks of the season. That doesn’t mean Shaq produced. He got 17 total snaps over the last two games (including playoffs) and didn’t show much. Still, his impact was felt inside One Buc Palace, Bucs GM Jason Licht said yesterday at the NFL Scouting Combine. “Ahh, it was great. He was great with the young players,” Licht said of Shaq. “It was like having another coach. Shaq is one of the best, one of the best all-time.” With energy in his voice, Licht added that Shaq could return next season. He’ll turn 33 in November. “We’ll never close the door on Shaq,” Licht said. “We’ll see where that goes. We never close the door on Shaq.” Joe asked Licht if Shaq wants back in, and Licht quickly replied that Shaq indeed wants to wear pewter and red in 2025, Joe’s fine with a Shaq return, if he’s very inexpensive. Yes, Shaq represents an upgrade from guys like Markees Watts and José Ramirez, and YaYa Diaby is very quick to credit Shaq for how much he mentored him successfully in 2023.|2025-02-27 13:32:00|227|46|6|Shaq Barrett|Shaq Barrett wants to return to Tampa Bay Buccaneers.|6|Mixed feelings on Shaq Barrett's return, mostly optimistic about his potential impact on the team.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Jeffrey Becker"", ""post"": ""why not. can\u2019t hurt. cheap is the magic word though"", ""post_time"": [""February"", ""27th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""1:35"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Bubby"", ""post"": ""Geez, I\u2019d welcome back Shaq but it\u2019s crazy to think just how bad our pass rush has gotten.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/todd-bowles-improvement-on-defense-needed-at-every-level/|Todd Bowles: Improvement On Defense Needed At Every Level|The pass defense stunk in 2024. It stunk in 2023, too. Something has to be done. It seems Bucs coach Todd Bowles has come to that decision. Speaking at the Indiana Convention Center in downtown Indianapolis, the beehive of the combine, Bowles seemed fed up with a lack of takeaways, a lack of an effective edge rush (HALLELUJAH!) and overall sloppy tackling. Bowles cited these issues on his get-done list.  “We’ve got to do a lot of things,” Bowles said. “I’m very disappointed in the way we went after balls this year – we didn’t get our hands on enough balls and get a lot of turnovers. “I don’t think we rushed the quarterback as well on the outside on the edge. We’ve got to get better at a few things. And we missed too many tackles.” Now, is Bowles fed up enough to hound Bucs AC/DC-loving general manager Jason Licht like he did to sign Baker Mayfield? Or the way Dirk Koetter stomped his feet for an edge rusher, which resulted in Jason Pierre-Paul and, subsequently, a Super Bowl win? Harold Landry is very much a JPP-like guy off the edge who is 28 years old. JPP was 29 when Licht stole him from the Giants. The above is one reason why Joe thinks Jamel Dean is in the crosshairs.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/quantifying-the-glory-days/|Quantifying The Glory Days|BY IRA KAUFMAN Jason Licht just used an interesting word to describe the state of the Buccaneers. Appearing at the NFL Combine in Indianapolis, the veteran GM said Tampa Bay is an “ascending” franchise. To all of the Todd Bowles skeptics out there, Licht’s label appears ludicrous. The Bowles bashers see a team stuck in the mud, spinning its wheels even as the Bucs have owned the NFC South since 2021. Upon further review, Licht’s assessment hardly ranks as an overstatement. After all, the Bucs have improved from an 8-9 finish in 2022 to 9-8, and then 10-7 last season. That doesn’t include the 2023 team’s rout of the Eagles in the opening playoff round. Do you know how many of the NFL’s 32 clubs have added to their win total in each of the past two seasons? Only four — the Bucs, Lions, Packers and Broncos. That’s a short list, backing up Licht’s claim that Tampa Bay is a franchise on the rise. It’s also a young club poised for a serious playoff run if the offseason goes Licht’s way. Every team churns the bottom of the roster every year. That’s life in the NFL, but the transformation of the Bucs since the 2020 championship season has been downright remarkable. Here are the starters from the Super Bowl team, noting that Vita Vea was limited to only five games due to a fractured ankle: OFFENSE    DEFENSE Tom Brady   Will Gholston Mike Evans   Ndamukong Suh Chris Godwin   Rakeem Nunez-Roches Antonio Brown   Shaq Barrett Rob Gronkowski   Lavonte David Ronald Jones   Devin White Donovan Smith   Jason Pierre-Paul Ali Marpet   Carlton Davis Ryan Jensen   Sean Murphy-Bunting Alex Cappa   Jordan Whitehead Tristan Wirfs   Antoine Winfield Jr. There’s a decent chance the team that lines up for Tampa Bay’s 2025 opener will feature only three or four starters from the championship roster. Godwin, Gholston and Barrett are unrestricted free agents. David is pondering retirement at the age of 35. The Bucs just waved goodbye to Whitehead. Even if you count Vea as a 2020 starter, the only sure players back from the Super Bowl team are Vea, Wirfs, Evans and Winfield Jr. That, ladies and gentlemen, is called a massive overhaul in a relatively short period of time. Is there any compelling reason to think the 2025 Bucs are going to fall on their keysters? Not really, unless you factor in a potential serious injury to Baker Mayfield. Licht has consistently added high-character players and Todd Bowles has forged a tight locker room. There are more reasons to believe this franchise will continue to ascend rather than decline. Mayfield’s in his prime, the offensive line is young and second-year back Bucky Irving is a 40-yard run waiting to happen. The offseason priorities are obvious — defense, defense, defense. The Bucs have the wherewithal and the motivation to give Bowles dynamic additions for his side of the ball. Fans welcome the news that Bowles is focused on sharpening Tampa Bay’s game management acumen. It’s not a stretch to suggest these are glory days for Buc fans. Five consecutive years of postseason play is a record stretch of relevance for a franchise that will celebrate its 50th year this fall. In the lexicon of sports, “ascending” is a beautiful word. Embrace it, Buc fans.|2025-02-27 12:51:00|547|26|6|Jason Licht|Buccaneers on the rise despite roster turnover and challenges.|4|Mixed sentiments ranging from optimism about potential to criticism of past performance.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""SlyPirate"", ""post"": ""\u201cTampa Bay is an \u201cascending\u201d franchise.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/you-just-cant-show-up-like-youre-playing-playstation/|“You Just Can’t Show Up Like You’re Playing PlayStation”|So why was the AdventHamstring Training Center (One Buc Palace) a borderline M*A*S*H unit with all the injuries the Bucs had last year? Players were dropping like flies in 2024. Antoine Winfield got hurt in Week 1 and was a shell of his All-Pro self. The secondary was riddled with injuries. A lot of folks immediately blame the Bucs for not doing (whatever) to prevent injuries. Of course, there was some howling for Bucs trainers to get run. Bucs coach Todd Bowles stuck up for his medical staff this week at the combine in Indianapolis. “Two years ago, we had the same schedule; we were one of the healthiest teams in the league,” Bowles said. “[In 2024], we had the same schedule and we were one of the most hurt teams in the league. “It is something you look at and check, but you can’t make sense of it now. Obviously, you want to do things better so they don’t get hurt. “When we did it right, we were praised for it. Then we do it right again [with the same schedule] and get bashed for it with injuries.” Bowles does know one solution is not acceptable. The Bucs, to try to avoid injuries, could go full-blown underwear football in all practices. No chance, Bowles said. “We do need to practice,” Bowles said, noting football is football and football is physical. “Obviously it’s a football game. You just can’t show up like you’re playing PlayStation. “We will try to figure out ways to mitigate injuries.” That’s the weird thing about injuries. They are largely unpredictable. One year, teams think they have it figured out, and the next week the team is a walking wounded organization.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/slam-dunk-josh-grizzard/|“Slam Dunk” Josh Grizzard|Rookie Bucs offensive coordinator Josh Grizzard is a protégé of Dolphins offensive guru Mike McDaniel, so Joe made sure to get private time with McDaniel this week at the NFL Combine in Indianapolis.  Joe already shared McDaniel talking about Grizzard’s preparation for securing a high-profile playcaller gig at just 34 years old. Today, it’ll be what McDaniel saw in Grizzard when he took over the Dolphins program in 2022 at 38 years old. Grizzard was a young holdover from the Brian Flores regime, but McDaniel didn’t send him packing like often happens when a new head coach arrives. “It goes back to, you know, in my reflection of my career, I’m not here if I didn’t have the fortune of being around Mike Shanahan, Kyle Shanahan and Gary Kubiak,” McDaniel said. “So I was very fortunate in my situation. As a new head coach, you evaluate a situation and you see a guy with talent that maybe wasn’t afforded the same opportunity. “So it was pretty easy to keep [Grizzard] on because he had the work ethic and the desire, and honestly I thought he would really do well being able to learn our system. And he’s absolutely taken that and run with it. That’s why he was a for sure slam dunk in my opinion to follow Liam Coen. So I’m really fired up for him and can’t wait to see what they do.” It’s worth noting that Grizzard and McDaniel played football for Yale University but not at the same time. Surely they must have bonded through their shared life experience, but Grizzard didn’t stick through three head coaches in Miami because he’s an Ivy League grad. In fact, McDaniel never even mentioned Yale to Joe. The “for sure slam dunk” description by McDaniel really struck Joe. If Grizzard really is a hidden gem, the Bucs should be able to maintain their high offensive output of last season and remain contenders.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/winning-with-jason-licht-part-iii-a-victory-lap/|Winning With Jason Licht (Part III) — “A Victory Lap”|All this week at the NFL Combine, high-ranking team suits have been plotting, scheming, angling, misdirecting and investigating for the start of free agency in 11 short days. So Joe thought this would be a great time to roll out a multi-part series on Buccaneers Ring of Honor general manager Jason Licht.  Licht’s made many defining moves that turned the Bucs into a Super Bowl champ and a lasting contender that has since won four consecutive division titles. During a private sitdown last year, Joe asked new Raiders general manager John Spytek, the former Bucs assistant GM, to field Joe’s questions on all things Licht. Spytek and Licht were very competitive inside One Buc Palace when it came to scouting and player evaluation. They would make strong their cases for players and dig in — playfully and professionally — when they didn’t get the same level of agreement from the other guy. Asked to name the best Licht draft pick, meaning a standout player that Spytek would put in Licht’s personal win column, he named iconic Bucs receiver Chris Godwin without hesitation. Spytek and the scouting staff liked Godwin, he said, but it was Licht who was much deeper love and on board the Godwin train early in the scouting process. “Chris Godwin was Jason’s guy from the start,” Spytek said. “And then the Rose Bowl happened; he played a fantastic Rose Bowl. Jason kind of did a victory lap on us like, ‘Told you guys.’ The more time we spent with Chris, he became exactly the guy that you guys see. “I just think Jason deserves a ton of credit for that. Godwin’s going to retire as the second-best Bucs receiver of all-time behind a first-ballot Hall of Famer.” What a third-round pick Godwin was, the 11th receiver taken in the 2017 NFL Draft. And guess who agrees with Spytek? Some guy named Mike Evans. Joe asked the same question of Evans and he pointed to Godwin, too. “People don’t realize what an ultimate pro he is,” Evans said of Godwin. “I’m not saying he’s a better receiver than me, but I’ve learned a ton from him in all aspects of the game, really from Day 1.” In a future piece in this series, Joe will share the words of someone who disagrees with Spytek and Evans on this subject, and tells a very intriguing draft-night story.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/bucs-get-dinged-on-nflpa-report-card/|Bucs Get Dinged On NFLPA Report Card|The nuns would be peeved at Joe. If Joe got this low of a grade on something in school, Joe would have to stick out a hand so a sexually frustrated nun with a wooden pointer would whack Joe’s palm — provided Joe didn’t get punched by a priest first. The NFLPA pumped out its annual team report card, conveniently timed when all #NFLMedia is clustered into one building in downtown Indianapolis. Each team was graded on how it treats its players whether players perceive the team to be a good employer in various categories. In an overall grade, the Bucs were ranked No. 27 in the league. First, the highlights: The strength coaches got an A. Wrote the NFLPA: “100% of players report that they get an individualized plan from their strength coaching staff, one of the three teams in the league with a perfect score.” Also, the Bucs have good grub. They got a B+ grade for the team’s nutritionist/dietician. The training staff was graded better with a B. Weight room got a B as well, and Bucs coach Todd Bowles got a B+. Maybe having edge rushers drop back into coverage so much came back to bite Todd Bowles, preventing him from getting an A? Overall, Bucs players gave their locker room a “C” and cited bad plumbing and a persistent stench in the locker room. Will that be gone with Joe Tryon-Shoyinka’s expected departure? (Joe once remembers Tristan Wirfs trying to find the source of a scent he claimed smelled like baby powder, and he believed one of the members of the Tampa Bay pen and mic club wore some weird cologne that smelled like it.) In only one category did the Bucs get a grade worse than a C- and that was ownership. Team Glazer received a D-. Among the reasons for the low score was a perceived lack of investment in facilities and allegedly not contributing to the winning culture of the team. Joe isn’t sure about the latter. Doesn’t culture start at the very top?

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/just-say-no-to-jaire-alexander-unless/|Just Say No To Jaire Alexander, Unless…|As a fan pointed out in the comments, beware of players whose teams wash their hands of them. That’s not always an absolute, but Joe thinks in this case there is some merit to the cliché. Joe and fellow fans are fed up with Jamel Dean missing so much time. Now Joe likes Dean the player (not many do), but Joe cannot depend on the guy. He’s always hurt and you don’t get healthier as you get older. And Dean’s closer to 30 every day. When it comes time for the playoffs, if Dean is even on the field, he won’t be for very long. That’s for sure. That brings Joe to Packers starting corner Jaire Alexander. The Packers are shopping him. Alexander is a talented player but he misses more time than Dean with injuries. No lie. A lot more. In the last four years, Dean has missed 11 games, including five this year, the most he has ever missed in a season. Alexander? He’s missed 34 games in the same time frame! Good grief. If the Bucs are irked by Dean’s injuries (Todd Bowles seemed irked when he grumbled yesterday about players missing time), then the answer is not bringing in Alexander. Now if you want to restructure Dean’s contract and sign Alexander on the cheap, and figure if you have both guys they could add up to a full season of starts, well, that’s a novel approach. But Joe wouldn’t say that’s savvy at all. Joe would rather the Bucs bring in a corner who doesn’t miss a month because he has a sore pinky or a guy happens to fall on him.|2025-02-27 00:00:00|276|20|3|Jaire Alexander|Concerns about players' injury history and potential trade considerations.|4|Mixed sentiment with concerns about current players and suggestions for improvements.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""OR Buc"", ""post"": ""If there are any trades it should be for a pass rusher, like Harold Landry.
