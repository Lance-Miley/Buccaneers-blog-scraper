https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/cameron-brate-assesses-bucky-irving/|Cameron Brate Assesses Bucky Irving|So former Bucs tight end Cameron Brate was on the field for great running back play in his career, including Doug Martin’s mindblowing rookie Pro Bowl season (2015), the 2020 edition of Ronald Jones and the magical spurts of Leonard “Playoff Lenny” Fournette. Now Brate gets to study Bucky Irving as a Buccaners Radio Network analyst, and he’s sounds like he’s hit a new level of impressed. “It’s amazing, like his shiftiness, the first guy not only doesn’t tackle him; the first guy never gets a hand on him,” Brate said. “And then, you know, it takes two or three guys to bring him down and then he’s falling forwared, too, on that. So it seems like every single time Bucky gets the ball it’s not going to be a negative play. “You’re going to stay ahead of the chains and he has the capability to then turn a 5-yard play into a 40-yard play. “What I’ve been really impressed with is his contributions in the passing game, too, just very natural both as a blocker and a receiver. Yeah, just super-impressed with Bucky.” Well said, Cam. As Joe shared, Irving ranks second in the NFL in yards after contact at or behind the line of scrimmage, one less yard than Saquon Barkley. But there’s no “YAC” if you make a guy miss completely, which Irving is known for. What a gem Buccaneers Ring of Honor general manager Jason Licht found in Round 4. Finally, finally, finally, this was the year that the Bucs were a team that annually finds a hit-the-ground-running RB that takes the league by surprise and by storm.|2024-12-03 14:00:00|272|27|'9|Cameron Brate|Impressed by Bucky Irving's playmaking abilities.'|2|Mixed comments with skepticism, praise, injury concerns, and complaints about coaching decisions.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Rod Munch"", ""post"": ""How long until all the praise for Bucky turns around like it did for the Muscle Hamster, and people are whining about the fact he only got 68 yards on a breakaway run, and not a TD, because he was ran down from behind."", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""3rd,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""2:10"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""David Pear"", ""post"": ""And yet he\u2019s been kept on the bench in too many critical situations.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/damn-man-that-boy-caught-up-to-me/|“Damn, Man, That Boy Caught Up To Me”|So Todd Bowles shared a lot of love yesterday for the Sunday play of edge rushers YaYa Diaby and Anthony Nelson, plus defensive tackle Calijah Kancey. “Vita Vea” was not on the coach’s lips during his visit with WFLA sports czar Dan Lucas. Vea had a quiet game, and it seems he didn’t impress his head coach. Courtesy of that low-key day from Vea and Kancey ripping off his sixth sack in only seven games played this season, each of the beastly Bucs defensive tackles has six sacks with five games remaining. They’ve also got a friendly sacks competition brewing, per Kancey speaking on the Buccaneers Radio Network. ‘Damn, man, that boy caught up to me,’ Vea said, according to Kancey. Kancey added that both players were trying to break the tie in the fourth quarter and overtime Sunday. It didn’t happen. Joe hopes Vea and Kancey each get to 10 sacks. First, that could be an NFL record or close to it; Joe can’t recall hearing of two interior linemen teammates notching 10 or more sacks in the same season. But more important, if Vea and Kancey can close the season with that many impact plays, then there’s a great chance the Bucs finish 10-7. Plus, a rousing end to the season for Kancey should give him a ton of confidence entering the postseason and the 2025 campaign. Joe wouldn’t bet against Kancey racking up huge numbers in the stretch run.|2024-12-03 13:37:00|242|13|6|Vita Vea|Bucs defensive tackles' sack competition and playoff prospects.|4|Mixed sentiments on player performance and team, some critical comments but also high praise.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""DoooshLaRue"", ""post"": ""Another no-show game by VV?

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/nobody-flinched/|“Nobody Flinched”|It is said that teams take on the personality of their head coach. Joe realizes that makes some Bucs fans uneasy.  Todd Bowles is not a popular head coach and a lot of Bucs fans don’t like his chill and chronically steady demenor. Bowles made a comment yesterday to WFLA-TV sports chief Dan Lucas that showed that Bowles was proud of his team acting, well, like Bowles. After Baker Mayfield’s second brutal interception on a 3rd-and-1 play, Bowles said his team was pure glue, a unified rock. “Nobody flinched on the sideline. He threw the interception; nobody got upset,” Bowles said, aware that an untimely screwup like that can rattle some teams. “The defense went out and played. The offense went back out there and ran the ball and made some timely throws and we got it done.” Yes, Bowles is brimming with confidence while much of Bucs fandom is completely flummoxed by the Bucs’ uninspiring showing at Carolina on Sunday. Regardless, it’s easy to see that the Bucs are a tight group capable of weathering rollercoaster-ride games and an up-and-down season. The proved it last year and are in the midst of it in 2024. Can the Falcons pull that off without becoming a fractured roster? Joe wouldn’t bet on it.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/why-4/|Why?|Now this is a major head-scratcher. So the Bucs on Sunday made Bryce Young — who was benched earlier this season and ridiculed so much it seemed his first name became “Bust” — look like the best quarterback in the NFC South at times. But then there were times when Young appeared to look like the quarterback Dave Canales benched for ineffective play. Per NextGen Stats by way of Eric Edholm of NFL.com, Young tore up the Bucs when Tampa Bay played zone defense. But when Todd Bowles flipped to man-to-man defense, Young was downright terrible. Bryce Young was at his best passing against the Buccaneers’ zone coverage in Week 13, completing 23 of 32 attempts for a season-high 242 yards. Against man coverage, Young completed just 3 of 14 attempts for 56 yards. So if man defense was smothering Young but zone defense let Young slice apart the Bucs, why the hell was Bowles running a zone defense so much? Why? Surely the stats crowd on the headset in Bowles’ ear had this information. At least Joe hopes they would during live action. If Bowles couldn’t sense his zone defense was getting torched and that his man defense was getting the job done, surely the Bucs’ stats crowd sitting upstairs had these facts — or at least a defensive assistant should have noticed. (If the stats people didn’t have this intel as the game was being played, then why even have them on coaches’ headsets?) This intel should have relayed to Bowles. Was it and Bowles just ignored it? Or did he not see it with his own eyes? Someone — Bowles, defensive coaches, the geeks upstairs — really dropped the ball here. And it damn near cost the Bucs a playoff berth.|2024-12-03 07:25:00|294|97|5|Bucs|Confusion over defensive strategy leads to near playoff disaster.|2|Commenters express frustration and doubt about Todd Bowles' defensive strategy and coaching abilities.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""LittleSage"", ""post"": ""No lead is safe with a Todd Bowles defense.

Joe thinks that perhaps Bowles misunderstood the question about those receivers making up Godwin’s production. Bowles explained none of them are Godwin. “Well, they’re not going to be Chris Godwin,” Bowles said. “I think [quarterback Baker Mayfield is] very comfortable with them because when Mike [Evans] was hurt as well, they got more comfortable early in the season. “That’s paying dividends right now. We’re not asking them to be Chris, we changed some of the routes for them so they can be themselves and we’re comfortable with them helping us out going forward.” No, Joe doesn’t think the coaches were asking Trey Palmer, Sterling Shepard and/or Jalen McMillan to be Godwin. None can or ever will. However (and this is stat geeky baseball philosophy here), all the Bucs needed was for receivers to raise their games to a point that maybe two could have half of Godwin’s numbers each. Two receivers who get half of Godwin’s production would make up for his loss, assuming they caught balls at the same rate as Godwin. Since Godwin was hurt in Week 7, tight end Cade Otton improved to the point he’s a top-third tight end in the NFL in receiving. So if two of the three receivers down the depth chart could only raise their games a little to go along with Otton’s improvement, that could add up to replace Godwin’s production.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/bucky-irving-saquon-barkley/|Bucky Irving = Saquon Barkley|Bucky Irving is beginning to show he’s one of the best running backs in the NFL. He ranks fifth in the NFL in yards per carry at 5.5. But it is his YAC yards that put him in even more elite company. The numbers Rich Hribar of Sharp Football Analysis dug up on Irving blew Joe’s mind. Joe thinks it is fair to say that Saquon Barkley is the best running back in the league. Even when he is behind or at the line, Barkley still gets production. Per Hribar, Barkley has scratched for 257 yards after contact behind or at the line of scrimmage. Impressive. Well, that just one more yard than Irving has. Irving is No. 2 in the NFL in YAC yards after getting hit behind or at the line with 256. “He’s getting more comfortable with the offense,” Bucs coach Todd Bowles said of Irving yesterday. “The more comfortable he gets, the more you can give him, the more he can do. “Both [Irving and Rachaad White] are running well – we’re happy with both of them. Bucky has a skill you can’t teach – he can make people miss in the hole. He’s tough on the inside.” What’s wild is Irving isn’t that big of a guy. But damn if he doesn’t get the job done. The Bucs had the worst rushing attack in football last year. Through 12 games, the Bucs are No. 8 in rushing yards per game and No. 4 in yards per carry. A really big reason for that massive improvement is Irving. Joe was thinking about this last night: Who is a better draft pick right now, first-round draft pick Graham Barton or fourth-round pick Irving? @LordReebs: Bucky Irving has 256 yards rushing when contacted at or behind the line of scrimmage per TruMedia. Only Saquon has more (257). Irving has those yards on 40 fewer attempts than Barkley when hit at or behind the line. … Irving is averaging a league-high 4.0 YPC when hit at or behind the line. The average for Running Backs this season is 1.6 yards per rush.|2024-12-03 03:45:00|353|27|'8|Bucky Irving|Emerging as top NFL running back.'|5|Mixed sentiments about player performance, coaching decisions, and team injuries, with occasional praise and criticism.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Steven #55"", ""post"": ""Irving was our best pick Worst to #8 in rushing says it all"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""3rd,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""5:01"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""A Bucs Fan"", ""post"": ""Let\u2019s get him healthy!

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/bucs-punt-brutal-punter/|Bucs Punt Brutal Punter|Yesterday in his day-after presser, Bucs coach Todd Bowles virtually promised the Bucs would bring in punters this week to work out and perhaps join the Bucs. Joe didn’t blame him. Bowles proved to be a man of his word. Not only will the Bucs work out punters, they will have a new punter this week. In one of the worst displays Joe has seen from a punter/kickoff specialist/place-kicking holder in one game, the Bucs booted Trenton Gill yesterday. So yes, the Bucs will have a new punter/kickoff specialist/place-kicking holder for the Raiders game on Sunday. The Bucs booted Gill. Not only did Gill gag with really poor punting, there was a snap/hold exchange that got fouled up late which caused a Chase McLaughlin field goal attempt to miss its mark. The icing on the cake was Gill missing the landing zone on a kickoff after a McLaughlin field goal gave the Bucs a 20-13 lead with just over three minutes left in the game, which gave the Stinking Panthers the ball on their own 40-yard line. This could have been lethal given the stakes that were involved with the Bucs and their playoff chances. The Bucs would have been better off with Turner Gill. Joe was so outraged about Gill’s gagging that he took to Twitter Sunday night and called for the Bucs to just give Gill $500 and tell him he had to fly home commercial and the Bucs would ship his items from his locker room at One Buc Palace to his residence and make sure to deactivate his One Buc Palace keycard.
