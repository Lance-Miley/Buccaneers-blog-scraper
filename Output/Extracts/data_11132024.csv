https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/11/todd-bowles-names-his-two-most-improved-bucs/|Todd Bowles Names His Two Most Improved Bucs|To say Todd Bowles is bullish on these two dudes would be an understatement.It’s the bye week, so Bowles got a couple of state-of-the-union questions during his trip to the Buccaneers Radio Network.One asked the head coach to name his most improved players, one on each side of the ball.Bowles went right to the big man with the funny helmet, right tackle Luke Goedeke. While Goedeke missed four games with a concussion, Bowles said his time on the field shows that he’s one of the very best right tackles in football.On defense, Bowles went with his prized rookie pupil Tykee Smith, the third-round draft pick.Smith doesn’t just get a most-improved nod from Bowles. It sounds like Bowles sees Smith as his defensive MVP.“Tykee Smith has probably had the best season over there [on defense] so far,” Bowles said. “And he’s had a heck of a year for us. And he sets the edge. He gets the ball out. He causes turnovers. He’s a very good tackler for us and he’s a very heady football player.”It’s always exciting when second-day draft picks rise up and become top-flight players. Goedeke, a 2022 second-round pick, was strong as a starter last year but Bowles said he’s shown significant improvement and is very “unsung.”|2024-11-13 19:22:00|210|23|8|Todd Bowles|Bowles names Goedeke and Smith as most improved players.|3| Mixed sentiments with some positivity and humor but also negativity and criticism.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Bucben1961"", ""post"": ""This is like my bald headed self telling you my 2 favorite hair conditioners"", ""post_time"": ""November 13th, 2024 at 2:25 pm""}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Dave Pear"", ""post"": ""No worries.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/11/the-fall-of-trey-palmer/|The Fall Of Trey Palmer|A year ago as a rookie, the Bucs were crowing about the potential of Trey Palmer, the speedster from Nebraska.Periodically he showed flashes why the Bucs were so high on him. Certainly, he could take the top off the defense. For whatever reason, he and Baker Mayfield didn’t seem to have their timing sharpened.And, of course, Palmer needed to work on his hands.In the playoff win over the Eagles, Palmer showed he was much more than a go-route receiver. He caught a short pass on the right side at midfield, made one Eagles defender miss, and Palmer was off to the races for a long touchdown, weaving through the defense using his speed to make defenders eat his cinders.This year? Palmer has been just slightly better than a rumor.This has been odd to Joe because Joe had an offensive coach tell him in training camp the team hoped to use Palmer more in the short passing game, letting his wheels take over to rack up explosive plays (see: playoff win over the Eagles).This year through 10 games, Palmer has nine catches. At this point last year as a rookie in heavy run-oriented offense, Palmer had 21 catches.It seems Palmer, for reasons unclear, has fallen out of favor with coaches. Consider what Todd Bowles said about the receivers earlier this week and how the offense has changed in the wake of the injuries to Mike Evans and Chris Godwin.“Any time you lose two All-Pros and you have a guy that’s playing for the first time, really – ‘Shep’ (Sterling Shepard) has played in this league but it’s his first time in the system – ‘J-Mac’ (Jalen McMillan) is a rookie, Trey [Palmer] is [in his] second year, you have Ryan [Miller] coming off the practice squad, so there [are] going to be some chemistry things,” Bowles said.Notice Bowles only mentioned Palmer right before he recited a practice squad dude’s name out of courtesy.Palmer entered the season as sort of WR3a or WR3b, depending on the direction of the breeze. Now? Joe isn’t sure Palmer is WR5. Miller has had more targets (11) the past three weeks than Palmer (7).Through the first 10 games last season, the fewest snaps Palmer played in a game was 23 in the season-opener.This year? In only two of the first 10 games has Palmer logged more than 27 snaps.It’s a mystery. Palmer is really the lone guy on the roster that can stretch the field.So with Evans and Godwin out and Palmer reduced to part-time status, no wonder the Bucs are throwing short so much. There’s no need for a defense to concern themselves with the long ball.|2024-11-13 17:30:00|442|41|3|Trey Palmer|Fall from potential star to underutilized receiver.|2| Lack of trust in young receivers|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Baker Bowl"", ""post"": ""It is really interesting, and honestly I have no idea either.

Some fans are acting like David is Cameron Jordan, the shell of himself former Bucs killer who has 3 sacks in his last 27 starts.David may have had a couple of rough games this season, but he’s still posting solid numbers. And Joe will suggest David might be suffering a bit because of who has been playing around him.Maybe David has lost a half step at 34 years old, but head coach Todd Bowles says David hasn’t lost a thing when it comes to practice.“[Lavonte is] so mentally tough and he loves the game. It’s something he grew up playing; he still treats it like he’s playing in high school, and that’s rare for a player,” Bowles told the Buccaneers Radio Network.“You either get bored or you get bunch of money and you don’t want to play any more. He’s not like that. Every day is like a game for him, whether it’s practice or a game. He still loves playing. He’s like a 16-, 17-year-old kid.”Joe loved hearing this about David.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/11/you-can-see-something-was-wrong-with-him/|“You Can See Something Was Wrong With Him”|So Buccaneers cornerback Zyon McCollum left Sunday’s gut-punch loss to San Francisco with a hamstring injury.He had an MRI yesterday.Joe has no word on the results and is almost scared to ask.Fellow starting cornerback Jamel Dean has been out for weeks with a bad hamstring. There is hope at One Buc Palace that Dean will practice next week and return soon after, but if the Bucs end up replacing McCollum with Dean, then that’s no upgrade to the porous secondary.Per Todd Bowles’ comments on the Buccaneers Radio Network this week, it seems McCollum tweaked his hamstring during Sunday’s game and played through it for several snaps.That may have cost the Bucs.“Zyon played tough but he didn’t tackle like he typically tackles. So you can see something was wrong with him,” Bowles said. “I think he missed about three tackles in the ballgame. If you take away that, he had the two penalties. So it wasn’t one of his better games, but he still made some plays for us.”McCollum did do some good things. For example, in the photo above, the end result was him breaking up that pass. But McCollum sure didn’t look right for a stretch in that game.Don’t get it wrong. Joe’s not saying McCollum 100 percent should have spoken up and come out of the game sooner. Maybe that’s the case, but Joe won’t argue that rookie Tyrek Funderburk would have done better if he replaced McCollum earlier.Bowles was harsh on Funderburk on the team’s radio network, calling his play against San Francisco “timid.”|2024-11-13 15:16:00|257|22|4|Zyon McCollum|Injury concerns impact Buccaneers' secondary performance.|3| Mixed emotions about injuries and staff|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""JerseyBucFan"", ""post"": ""Imagine Todd Bowles calling someone else \u201ctimid\u201d\u2026"", ""post_time"": ""November 13th, 2024 at 10:23 am""}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""garbs65"", ""post"": ""Seriously\u2026.what is with all the hamstring injuries on this team\u2026or is it just me?

Generally, this type of offense leaves a bad taste in Joe’s mouth.But how can Joe kvetch about an offense that works?Bucs offensive coordinator Liam Coen had done a strong job. But last Sunday’s game? Yikes. It was less than dink-and-dunk. More like underhand softball.Baker Mayfield threw at targets beyond 20 yards just twice against the 49ers. Neither was a completion.Mayfield only connected with wide receivers four times all game long.But how much did Coen dial back the offense? Mayfield had just one completion over 10 yards. Just one! Seven of his 11 completions came behind the line of scrimmage.Was this because left tackle Tristan Wirfs got hurt? Was this because Coen got spooked that Nick Bosa would run wild? Was the 49ers’ secondary locking down receivers that much?Or, is it what Joe believes, that the Bucs only having backup receivers finally caught up with them?|2024-11-13 14:00:00|158|28|2|Tampa Bay Buccaneers|Bucs offense struggles with limited passing game options.|6| Defense needs improvement|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""BallHawk75"", ""post"": ""Could it also be that Faker is just a dink and dunk QB?"", ""post_time"": ""November 13th, 2024 at 9:11 am""}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Ds"", ""post"": ""Are the WRs really that bad ?"", ""post_time"": ""November 13th, 2024 at 9:25 am""}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""heyjude"", ""post"": ""Last Sunday\u2019s game had errors.

They’re not.Players are enjoying their second day off in a row. Under NFL bye-week rules, head coach Todd Bowles was required to give players four consecutive days off. Instead, they got six (Tuesday through Sunday).Talking to WFLA-TV sports chief Dan Lucas, Bowles explained that if the Bucs had a scheduled practice today, the team wouldn’t have been able to get after it.“We got to get healthy first,” Bowles said. “I don’t think we could practice if we were to practice on Wednesday, we were probably walking through, so it didn’t make any sense.”Given that the Bucs have lots of little things to master, per Bowles, Joe would have preferred to see the team together today.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/11/bucs-are-bad-attacking-runners/|Bucs Are Bad Attacking Runners|There is room to improve within the Bucs defense.While the pass defense has been atrocious, the run defense? Well, the Bucs can be better. But they are not terrible.For total yards, the Bucs are the 14th-best run defense, having allowed 1,252 through 10 games.When it comes to yards per game, the Bucs give up 125 yards each week. That’s ranks No. 16 in the NFL.When it comes to yards per carry, the Bucs are awful, tied for fourth-worst allowing 4.8 yards a clip.It seems, just based on the stats from @Doug_Analytics, that the Bucs don’t attack the ball carrier very quickly. The Bucs allow an average of 2.2 yards before contact. Only the Giants and the slimy Saints are worse. Joe isn’t sure if the front-seven is getting blown out by blockers or they are slow to react or what.The slimy Saints canned their defensive-minded head coach. The Giants don’t seem ready to run their offensive-minded coach.With yards after contact, or YAC, the Bucs aren’t anything to brag about, either. But it’s not as bad as yards allowed before contact.Joe isn’t sure what to say here. If your head coach is a defensive-minded coach and the defense is bad, and his specialty is stopping the run and the run defense is lacking (despite having three first-round picks and a borderline Hall of Famer in your front-seven), well, that’s not a good look.|2024-11-13 12:00:00|232|10|5|Bucs|Bucs run defense needs improvement but not terrible.|3| Mixed sentiment on the Bucs defense|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Lt.

But, yeah, pressures are better than nothing, even though Joe thinks pressures are next to nothing.Joe has a lot of hope for Bucs outside linebacker YaYa Diaby. He’s still young. Has a ton of heart. And at times is beastly.Still, two sacks over 10 games? Even Diaby will admit that won’t cut it. So he’s looking at maybe four sacks this year?Diaby, is giving Bucs fans a glimmer of hope, though.Per @Doug_Analytics, who gets some of his intel from FTN Data, Diaby averages the ninth-quickest time to get pressure on a quarterback.That means Diaby is getting himself in position to make a play, or preferably, level a quarterback. His average is 2.39 seconds to get pressure. That’s slightly better than Micah Parsons (2.41) and almost as fast as Maxx Crosby (2.38).Alex Highsmith of the Steelers only needs 2.03 seconds to get pressure.So there is something there with Diaby. The next step is getting him to level quarterbacks, not just scare them.|2024-11-13 08:45:00|170|26|5|YaYa Diaby|Promising young linebacker|7| Mixed sentiments on player performance and team potential.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Scott"", ""post"": ""He is the only one doing well.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/11/bucs-soon-to-play-internationally-once-every-two-years/|Bucs Soon To Play Internationally Once Every Two Years|On Sunday morning Joe typed how NFL strongman Roger Goodell is looking at eight games next season to be played on foreign soil. That meant there is roughly a 50/50 shot the Bucs play a game next season outside the United States.If there are eight games, that means 16 teams likely will be involved. In other words, half the league.Per Albert Breer of SI.com, the league has a plan, approved by NFL owners, that each team will play an international game every other year. And, each team will be required to give up a home game to host an international game once every four years.Breer typed that’s why Goodell is eyeing eight foreign games in 2025.NFL owners have already agreed to a model that’ll compel each of them to give up a home game every four years, and play internationally every other year. The eight-game setup allows for that, where 16 teams go each year.Given the Bucs are one of a handful of teams with marketing rights in Germany, and that the Bucs recently opened up a bar on Marienplatz in Munich called “Krewe Embassy” (sponsored by Killian’s if you can imagine!), the chances the Bucs return to Munich seem good.Goodell last week from Munich (where the NFL attempted to wreck decades of strong relations between Germany and the United States by assaulting the locals with the Giants-Stinking Panthers game) was asked about rumors of the NFL playing in Berlin next year. Goodell responded, “Believe them.”Berlin city government this week voted to make a putsch push to host an NFL game for the next five years. Joe will take a stab and say the Bucs will be playing somewhere in Germany in 2025 or 2026.|2024-11-13 05:00:00|285|22|8|Bucs|NFL plans to play internationally every other year|5| Mixed reactions to NFL international games varying from frustration to excitement and understanding.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Tony"", ""post"": ""They seriously need to stop this crap because it\u2019s not fair to the fans here.
