https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/i-do-know-that-theyll-be-targeting-corners/|“I Do Know That They’ll Be Targeting Corners”|Sound the alarm. Release the hounds! Draft chatter is seeping out of One Buc Palace. “I do know that they’ll be targeting corners. I know that they’ll be looking at an inside linebackers,” Rondé Barber told WDAE radio this afternoon. Someone tell Jamel Dean to hold off on buying Rick Springfield tickets. Remember, Barber is a trusted man in the football court of Buccaneers Ring of Honor general manager Jason Licht, who has been known to invite Barber to an official meeting and ask him to watch film of prospects. Barber even wanted the Tampa Bay area today to know today that he’ll be “in the building quite a bit in the offseason.” The Hall of Fame cornerback also said, “I talk to Jason about players.” This is why Joe is hypersensitive to any Barber comments. Could Barber be working with Licht in a CIA-style misinformation campaign designed to make the world believe the Bucs are looking to draft a cornerback in Round 1? Perhaps. There is a deep Bucs state but Joe still can’t prove it publicly. Regardless, Barber seems to think the Bucs are poised to improve next season. “I know that they’ll find what they need to help us win some more games in 2025, man,” he said.|2025-03-17 19:05:00|211|45|7|Rondé Barber|Draft plans hinted by trusted source in Buccaneers organization.|5|Mixed opinions on drafting CBs and LBs, some optimism, some skepticism, and some trade suggestions.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Mike"", ""post"": ""It\u2019s no secret, Bucs need a CB and an Inside LB.

Bowles clearly stated that he did not have CBs that he could trust in man.  The Licht and Co. Bucs have shown that they aren\u2019t afraid to double up on DBs in a draft and that they\u2019re pretty good at finding NFL starters in rounds 2-5.  This would be a great draft to grab another pair in that range.  Preferably guys with press man and ball skills.  That would open up sections of Bowles\u2019 playbook that have been on the shelf for years and likely help shore up the way the Bucs defense has been hemorrhaging passing yardage for years now.  I love the idea of converted WR and physical freak Darien Porter or sound technician Trey Amos in the second.  Both have NFL press man skill sets but also thrive in zone.  Porter blocked 5 kicks in his career.  Certified ball hawk and press man master Nohl Williams can be had in the third or fourth. Melo Dotson fits the same profile and should be available in the same late day two range.  The Bucs need bodies at the CB position.  I remember most of us balking at how many were on the roster after last season\u2019s final cuts to 53 but sure enough by mid season they were still short at the position.  If Bowles must devote that many roster spots to a position it would be nice if that legion of DBs could be deployed in both man and zone configurations.  I\u2019ll take ball hawks with proven production over track speed or man coverage skill though.  The 2025 Bucs need to produce more picks far more than they need to bolster their sack total.  There are a lot of CBs who play with a nasty streak in this draft.  It\u2019s uncanny how many of these players play bigger than their britches against the run and seem to little things like quick outs and dump offs for 5 yards super personally.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/robert-hainsey-takes-baker-mayfield-reminder-to-jacksonville/|Robert Hainsey Takes Baker Mayfield “Reminder” To Jacksonville|It almost sounded like former Bucs center/fan punching bag Robert Hainsey said recently that he learned more from Baker Mayfield than Tom Brady. Hainsey, Jacksonville’s new big-money center, was asked on the team website about working with Tom Brady and Baker Mayfield during his four seasons in Tampa. What did he learn from working with those guys? Hainsey said being around Brady was “pretty cool” and he learned a lot of football from Brady, in addition to learning how to be a professional and take care of his body. Mayfield? Hainsey’s praise was over the top. “He’s the ultimate teammate,” Hainsey said of Mayfield. “He’s the ultimate competitor and I can’t really say enough good things about him because it was a blast to work with him. He changed my life a lot just because of the way he operates. It’s like, ok, he’s here to win, he’s here to compete. That’s what we’re all trying to do but he brings it every day. Always a constant reminder of what your mentality needs to be like when you’re walking into this building.” Joe was pleased to hear the Mayfield respect flowing from Hainsey, who no longer has to tow the Bucs’ company line. Mayfield has been an incredible signing by Buccaneers Ring of Honor general manager Jason Licht. It’s one everyone knows about but routinely overlooks. Man, if Mayfield somehow delivers the Bucs a Super Bowl ring next season, he’ll be a better signing than Brady.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/lavonte-david-derrick-brooks-is-mr-franchise/|Lavonte David: Derrick Brooks “Is Mr. Franchise”|Lavonte David is one of the greatest players in Bucs history. But he’s still looking up at Mr. Derrick Brooks, statistically, historically and in reputation. Who says that? Lavonte David, that’s who. David has the fifth-most solo tackles of all NFL players since the league began keeping tackling stats in 1994. David finished last season with a career total of 1,111 solo tackles. One player ahead of David is Brooks, who has 1,300 solo tackles. So if David keeps up his pace — averaging 85 solo tackles a season — he wouldn’t touch Brooks’ mark for most franchise solo tackles unless he plays in 2026. Maybe. And if he stays healthy. David was asked today about possibly catching Brooks. He admitted that was in the back of his mind but it wasn’t a major reason why he chose to play at least another season. David wanted to make it clear: He respects the hell out of Brooks, but he’s no Brooks. “I’m not competing with Derrick Brooks – Derrick Brooks is still light years ahead of where I want to be,” David said. “It would be an incredible accomplishment, to be the leader for a franchise in tackles – that’s something that every kid dreams of, especially a kid in my position. “I never thought I would be signing a contract to play my 14th season with the same organization. It’s incredible, man. It’s very humbling, it’s very amazing. It would be great to [reach 1,300 tackles], but at the same time, I’m just blessed to be able to play this game. “‘D.B. is Mr. Franchise. Everybody wants to model what they do after Derrick Brooks, on the field and off the field. To be mentioned in the same breath is always incredible for me.” David has deep respect for Brooks. Recently when he appeared on NFL Network to discuss returning to the Bucs, he noted how humbled he was to be mentioned with Rondé Barber and Brooks as Bucs ironmen, being one of the few to play 13+ years for the Tampa Bay. So Joe guesses David is not ruling out playing a 15th season. If he really is chasing Brooks, it would be a season for the ages for 35-year-old David to tie or break Brooks’ mark next season. David needs 189 solo tackles to catch Brooks. David’s season-high is 147 back in 2015. The NFL record for most solo tackles in a season was Ray Lewis in 1997 with 156.|2025-03-17 16:32:00|413|9|7|Lavonte David|David targets franchise tackling record but respects Derrick Brooks highly.|7|Admirably optimistic comments reflecting appreciation for Lavonte David's athleticism and career.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Idroolpewter&red"", ""post"": ""Ironman indeed.

And now enhanced by a trip to the Combine and some nuggets direct from Cosell, one if my other favorite proper draft analysts!  This made my night.  It\u2019s absolutely awesome stuff.  My personal target for the Bucs in the first is Donovan, ideally with a little trade back, but if Green or Pearce fall to the Bucs and they end up being the pick I\u2019ll still be pleased.  I have faith in Licht and Co. to make the right call when it comes to their respective character issues.  Green is rumored to have had a pair of incidents of getting pushy with females but all anyone knows for sure is he was dismissed from the team at West Virginia his freshman year for \u201cundisclosed reasons.\u201d  He was my first favorite but Donovan and his refined technique, character, freaky wingspan and times at the combine have him as my firm favorite after more thorough scrutiny.  His wingspan is basically the same as the OTs he\u2019ll be facing and I know Mr. Sullivan doesn\u2019t put much stock in arm length since it can be compensated for with technique but it does convey an advantage in establishing the arc of contact around the edge and gives him a wider strike zone as a tackler.  Green has T-Rex arms and hands and he used them beautifully against the likes of Coastal Carolina but the character concerns and lack of length contributes to his lack of value against the run, makes it easier for NFL OTs to wash him out of the pocket have and have busted him way down in my eyes.  Pearce is awesome but he\u2019ll be gone by the Bucs pick methinks.  I like all the Bucs interviews except for Princely.  He is not a clean scheme fit and his film is meh.  Reddick is great but only under contract for 2025 and one of these players all represent good value to me so unless Nick Emmanwori is still on the board I\u2019d take a true edger over Campbell.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/lavonte-david-reflects-on-lost-super-bowl-chance/|Lavonte David Reflects On Lost Super Bowl Chance|Lots of Bucs players and officials agonized for a long time over the January playoff loss to Washington.  A missed sack by Calijah Kancey, other lost opportunities and a doink Commanders field goal to win by three points made for rough postgame times. Earlier this year, Todd Bowles told Joe it would take a long time to get over the loss. No 24-hour rule on that game. Joe asked Lavonte David today at One Buc Palace how he handled the defeat and David didn’t hesitate to respond. He saw it as a lost shot at a ring, which is extra painful for a guy like David who has seen many tough Bucs seasons. “It was real hard,” David began. “I felt like we had the opportunity to play in the Super Bowl this past season. You know, I feel like we had the guys. I feel like we were in the [right] place. I feel like we were motivated but things just didn’t go our way. A lot of things that we could have done better and I feel like once you learn from those things you get seasoned and you feel like you can take it the next step.” David added that the experience will benefit so many young returning Bucs and leave the whole roster more hungry. “I feel like we’re even more motivated now … I feel like we can get over that next step,” David said. Joe likes David’s mentality on this and Joe assumes it’s matched by the other veterans across the team. Hopefully, that helps prevent what’s become an annual midseason dip in the Bucs’ play.|2025-03-17 11:46:00|272|41|7|Lavonte David|Buccaneers reflect on Super Bowl loss|5|Mixed sentiments with critique of Baker and defense, optimism for the team's future success.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""GJ"", ""post"": ""I think consistency and having a majority of the team back together will cut down on the turnovers and mistakes that popped up occasionally and that this year is going to be the one in which they put it all together.

That\u2019s like having an offense that goes up and down the field and doesn\u2019t score touchdowns. Who cares?? So what?? On top of that your QB lead the league in turnovers which is putting a struggling defense on the field more than they should. Want to level up? David in particular needs to work on his drops. Too many times last year I saw him make bad decisions at the top of the stem on which receiver to take in zone coverage. Most will blame it on his age but David is still moving at an elite level. The defense as a whole needs to get drastically better at zone defense if that\u2019s what the identity is going to be.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/known-quantity/|Known Quantity|BY IRA KAUFMAN He was lost and now he’s found. Haason Reddick’s “bizarre” season with the 2024 Jets is in his rear-view mirror. His eyes are now fixed dead ahead toward helping Tampa Bay resurrect a pass rush that was agonizingly erratic for Buc Nation last season. Reddick is also about to discover that the distance between these two franchises is far greater than 1,100 miles.  The Glazers may not be the league’s best owners, but Woody Johnson, who purchased the Jets in 2000, is among the worst. The Jets have suffered through nine consecutive losing seasons and haven’t made the playoffs since 2010. The Bucs need Reddick’s pass-rushing skills in the worst way and at the age of 30, Reddick is poised to give Tampa Bay his best. If he recaptures his old form, Reddick stands to cash in next year as a free agent. He was drafted by the Cardinals in 2017, the final year for Bruce Arians on the Arizona sidelines before he switched to the broadcast booth. His first three years in the desert produced only 7.5 sacks as Arizona coaches inexplicably moved Reddick from the edge to inside linebacker. “Haason Reddick is a great kid,” Arians said in between golf rounds. “He struggled to play against the run early in his career, but he figured it out. He’s a great pass rusher. I thought it was a great move by the Bucs. I think he can have a year like Shaq Barrett did when he first came to Tampa.” Barrett registered 19.5 sacks for Tampa Bay in 2019, the year Arians and Todd Bowles arrived at One Buc Place. In 2022, Reddick posted 16 sacks for the Eagles during the regular season and 3.5 more takedowns in the playoffs. You don’t have to be a math major to figure out the total — 19.5 sacks. When his peers chose the NFL’s top players a few months later, Reddick came in at No. 48. “He’s kind of like a tweener guy, a little bit of a ‘backer and a little bit of a defensive end,” said Philadelphia’s former All-Pro center Jason Kelce. “But he’s 100 percent of a pass rusher. No matter what game we’re playing, Haason’s going to get his.” The stage appears to be set for Reddick to prove his disastrous year in New York was one big mistake. After the Jets traded for him, he failed to report until late October due to a contract dispute. He hired Drew Rosenhaus as his new agent and signed with the Bucs quickly as a free agent last week. “It’s really good for the Bucs,” Chris Simms said of the one-year deal that provides Reddick with $12 million in guaranteed money. “They need another guy on the edge and Haason Reddick has the ability to be a top-notch pass rusher. You’re across from YaYa Diaby and they’ve got Vita Vea and Calijah Kancey, so it’s going to be hard to double-team Reddick.” Tampa Bay’s 4-man pass rush is now established … it’s Reddick, Vea, Kancey and Diaby, reading from left to right. If they stay healthy, that’s a formidable group, one that should allow Bowles the flexibility to blitz strategically, instead of out of necessity. At times, Reddick has been compared to Von Miller as a dynamic pass rusher with a variety of moves to maneuver past offensive tackles. “He’s one of those guys that remind me of a Von, just being able to put his body in different positions,” said Rachaad White. Reddick arrives as far more of a known quantity than Barrett, who started only 15 games in four years with the Broncos before emerging as a Pro Bowl rusher in Tampa. Last season left a very bad taste in Reddick’s mouth and any suggestion that he’s past his prime is hard to swallow. Is he Myles Garrett or T.J. Watt? That’s quite a stretch, but all the Bucs pine for is a return to the Haason Reddick who rolled up 50.5 sacks in a 4-year span before his nightmare season in the city that never sleeps. If Reddick attains double-digit sacks, the Bucs will be open to giving him the long-term contract extension he craves. If Reddick disappoints, he’ll hit the free-agent market, seeking his fifth different team within a 6-year span. Reddick isn’t here to drop into coverage in the flat. He’s not here to stuff the strong-side running game. He’s here to hunt quarterbacks. Coming off a forgettable season, Reddick is seeking to atone for some poor decisions that cost him playing time and millions of dollars. It’s a fresh start, just in time for a Buccaneer franchise seeking a powerful finish.|2025-03-17 10:11:00|781|24|7|Haason Reddick|Reddick aims to revive pass rush for Tampa Bay Buccaneers.|7|Mixed sentiment, positive comments on Reddick's potential but some skepticism and concern raised.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Todd"", ""post"": ""As the mocks come more into focus there are a number of them starting to show Mike Green falling to the Bucs-Yeah."", ""post_time"": [""Todd""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Baking with Grizz"", ""post"": ""Im glad he is here.

Bowles won\u2019t have to rely on his \u201cguile,\u201d as the Sage often refers to it, that is his methods of manufacturing sacks with the use of frequent, exotic blitz packages that leave the middle of the field wide open.  The Bucs\u2019 sack totals have always been acceptable under Bowles and his defenses are consistently stingy when it comes to giving up points as well but the total pass yards he is giving up and the soft, wide open middle that feeds opponents QB\u2019s YPG and leaves the Bucs defense unable to make stops like they need to outside the red zone is a problem we have watched get worse and has fans foolishly calling for his head.  This defense doesn\u2019t just need more sacks to get to the Super Bowl.  It needs to cut down on opponents time to throw.  It needs better containment of mobile QBs and another ILB who can stay with the receivers who mirror those QBs when they leave the pocket and not get lost when they have to deal with multiple receivers in their zone.  Teddy Buchanan from Cal is an ILB can do that as well as blitz and play the run.  He is a former QB with excellent measurables who should be available in round 4 or 5 to step in as a rookie and patch that hole in the middle of Bowles\u2019 third down defense.  He is also a ballhawk- elite, decisive read and react skills in heavy traffic and hands that pulled in multiple one-hand INTs.  Reddick is an excellent addition at a great price but he is only the first item on the list of ingredients this defense needs to pick up and get cooking to make this defense Super Bowl worthy.  Besides closing the void in the middle the other long-standing and getting worse over the past few seasons issue is the glaring deficit in the INT department.  Another ball hawking Cal Player, CB Nohl Williams could help in the INT department as well as be something else Bowles said he did not have last season which is a CB who can play press man.  He should be there for the Bucs in the third round.  I\u2019m thrilled by the Reddick signing and his history with Foote- Licht and Co. can put a big fat check mark next to proven pass rusher but now it\u2019s time to move on to addressing the other glaring holes on the roster that are hamstringing the defensive side of the ball."", ""post_time"": [""March"", ""17th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""4:16"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter19"": {""username"": ""Defense Rules"", ""post"": ""teacherman \u2026 \u2018Bowles has finished top 10 on sacks every year he has been year.\u2019"", ""post_time"": [""March"", ""17th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""4:32"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter20"": {""username"": ""Simeon4HOF"", ""post"": ""Wonderful article as always"", ""post_time"": [""March"", ""17th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""5:31"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter21"": {""username"": ""Darin"", ""post"": ""One good year and then he quit playing.

Retired quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick wants to marry Jon Gruden and rookie Bucs playcaller Josh Grizzard for a day of film breakdown and mentoring. Fitzpatrick hosted Gruden on his Fitz & Whit podcast and point blank told the Super Bowl-winning Bucs coach that he’s got to bring Grizzard to his football lair in Tampa. Gruden often hosts ex-player and coaches at all levels of the game to study with him. “I need to connect you with Josh Grizzard,” Fitzpatrick told Chucky. “Young guy, really smart dude that’s been in a few different systems, and I think he can learn a lot from you and you’d help him out a lot. So I would like to hopefully bridge that gap for you guys.” Gruden seemed open to it and Joe is confident Grizzard is smart enough to be all over it. Remember, Grizzard and Fitzpatrick have a relationship dating back to Fitzpatrick mentoring him in Miami. Joe was always amazed that former Bucs tight end O.J. Howard passed on opportunities to sit down with Buccaneers Ring of Honor tight end Jimmie Giles, per Sage of Tampa Bay Sports Ira Kaufman. And Joe knows former Bucs cornerback Vernon Hargreaves didn’t seek out legend Rondé Barber early in his career for insight, even thought Barber was often at team headquarters.|2025-03-17 09:54:00|225|23|8|Josh Grizzard|Fitzpatrick and Gruden arrange mentoring session for Grizzard.|4|Mixed opinions on Gruden's potential impact, some skepticism, some support, and differing views on his relevance.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Greg"", ""post"": ""There are certain people that get it and others that don\u2019t and never will.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/i-thought-it-would-be-fun/|“I Thought It Would Be Fun”|Hey, if you can ball out and win at the same time, what is more fun than that? That’s the way new Bucs edge rusher Haason Reddick saw it when he decided to sign with the Bucs last week. The Bucs are a winning team. Reddick said he has known Bucs coach Todd Bowles for years and knew about him even longer. Tampa Bay almost became a no-brainer destination, he said, when you throw in a chance to help others on the field, re-establish as an elite edge rusher and win. “Just the fit,” Reddick said of what drew him to the Bucs. “After talking to Footy [outside linebackers coach Larry Foote], after talking to Coach Bowles, their vision for how they plan to use me here, that was very intriguing and something I knew I needed. “Outside of that, I felt like this was a team that was a couple short pieces away. I felt like that I could come and bring my knowledge, bring my abilities and blend it with the guys that are already here. “You’ve already great pieces. You’ve got Vita [Vea], you’ve got [Calijah Kancey], you’ve got YaYa [Diaby]. So just knowing that could come here and help out, I thought it would be fun.” Well, Joe is pretty sure if Reddick is drilling quarterbacks, then the Bucs are winning. And Joe wants that kind of fun. So the more sacks the merrier, Mr. Reddick. More sacks mean more wins and more fun for everyone.|2025-03-17 04:05:00|250|19|8|Haason Reddick|Reddick excited to join winning Bucs team|6|Fans show optimism, praise team and players, desire for specific draft picks to bolster defense.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Kenton Smith"", ""post"": ""Girls ain\u2019t the only ones who just want to have fun!"", ""post_time"": [""March"", ""17th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""4:19"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Jeffrey Becker"", ""post"": ""grats joe. u deserve this hand-picked signing"", ""post_time"": [""March"", ""17th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""5:09"", ""am""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""Bucsarg"", ""post"": ""Lots of football players think Todd the Bucs team and organization are winners.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/370066/|Running It Back|The Bucs are flying under the radar again. Joe’s hearing all the about the same teams from national football sophists: the Chiefs, the Vikings, the Eagles, the Commandos, the Bills, the Seahawks. Lil’ ‘ol Tampa Bay? Stuck down there in the NASCAR division? Pfft! Whatever. Well, Bucs AC/DC-loving general manager Jason Licht is once again quietly pulling off the unthinkable. Remember when the Bucs won the Super Bowl after the 2020 season? And Licht brought the whole gang back, 22+1 starters? Licht has basically done it again with pretty much every player on his dangerous offense returning. Well, one guy in the national media is paying attention. John Daigle hopped on the Ross Tucker Podcast last week, perhaps the best series of football-only podcasts you’ll find. There, while Daigle was speaking specifically about fantasy football, he basically warned folks that the Bucs may be even more dangerous on offense than when they finished with the third-best offense in the game last year. “Between [Chris] Godwin, Baker [Mayfield], Mike Evans, Bucky Irving in his second year, you just have to love the overall offense environment for Tampa Bay as a whole, said Daigle, of EstablishTheRun.com. Daigle also pointed out, yes, Liam Coen bolted in the dark of the night to Jacksonville but the Bucs did promote his right-hand man Josh Grizzard to replace him. Joe really hates to put pressure on a first-time offensive coordinator and first-time play-caller, but Grizzard has a chance to make this offense even better, even though that may be unfair and unreasonable. Think about it: The Bucs started three rookies in Graham Barton, Jalen McMillan and Bucky Irving. If those guys improve, common for good players, imagine how good this offense could be.  |2025-03-17 04:00:00|287|22|8|The Bucs|Bucs poised for powerful offensive season with returning talent.|4|Mixed sentiment with concerns about defensive depth, injuries, and luck impacting Super Bowl hopes.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""First Last"", ""post"": ""After so many bad seasons, I\u2019m fine just winning the division and making the playoffs.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/why-not-asante-samuel/|Why Not Asante Samuel?|Joe is of the mind that the Bucs, just like they needed an established edge rusher and signed Haason Reddick, need a quality cornerback in free agency. While the free agent crop has been picked through worse than a Plant City strawberry patch after St. Patrick’s Day, one cornerback catches Joe’s eye. That’s veteran corner Asante Samuel. He didn’t play much for the Chargers last year due to a bum shoulder. Before that, Samuel was a three-year starter in Los Angeles. He’s still just 25. One drawback on Samuel is he isn’t a ballhawk, which Bucs coach Todd Bowles professed to desire this offseason. Samuel has six picks, all from 2021-2023. Samuel just played in four games last year and had no picks. When opposing quarterbacks target Samuel, he has allowed 59.5 percent of those targets to be completed. Jamel Dean’s career completion percentage when targeted is 58.7. So it’s not like there is a huge drop off. BSPN NFL analyst and Chicago-area high school coach Matt Bowen has the following breakdown of Samuel. Samuel has a playmaking mentality at cornerback, with the foot quickness and sudden closing speed to break on the ball. A shoulder injury limited Samuel to four games last season, but he has six interceptions and 26 pass breakups in his four years with the Chargers. In the past four seasons, Dean has 34 pass breakups. Joe is not necessarily looking to replace Dean with whatever leftovers are available after a week of free agency. Joe actually thinks Dean is a decent if not good corner. Joe’s issue is he can’t stay on the field. Last year, for example, when Dean got hurt against the slimy Saints in New Orleans and missed four games, the Bucs cratered and lost four games in a row. Coincidence? Joe doesn’t believe in coincidences in the NFL. Half of those losses in that four-game tailspin were one-score games. Don’t think the Bucs could have used Dean in those games? And that’s why “this Joe” reached the end of his rope with Dean. Again, “this Joe” thinks he’s a good player but Dean could be Darrelle Revis and it wouldn’t matter if he can’t get on the field. What bothers Joe is that Dean couldn’t finish three of the last four Bucs playoff games, the most important games of the year. The last two playoff games Dean couldn’t finish were one-score games as well. Don’t think losing a starting corner in a close playoff game makes a difference? The Bucs will keep Dean. And Joe is OK with that so long as the Bucs have someone capable to fill in because you just know Dean will get hurt. It’s not if but when. Would Samuel be OK with being a part-time starter?|2025-03-17 03:45:00|461|24|7|Asante Samuel|Evaluating cornerback Asante Samuel for the Bucs' defense.|2|Mixed sentiments with skepticism and hope for improvement in the team's defense.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""garro"", ""post"": ""Joe!"", ""post_time"": [""March"", ""17th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""4:21"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""heyjude"", ""post"": ""Would love to get Asante.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/bucky-brooks-haason-reddick-bucs-a-perfect-free-agent-marriage/|Bucky Brooks: Haason Reddick, Bucs A “Perfect Free Agent Marriage”|The past few days, “this Joe” has been trying to fully immerse into March Madness and wallow in non-stop college basketball conference tournament games, as Joe is wont to do each spring. (Joe wants to thank the Florida Gators and the St. Johns Red Storm for making Joe nice beer money this past week.) Yes, Joe is into the college hoops this time of the year, no question. But Joe’s attention was, admittingly, distracted. Joe has been pounding beers for week still celebrating Bucs AC/DC-loving general manager Jason Licht shocking the world, breaking down and signing an established edge rusher in free agency. If Reddick is anything close to what he was from 2020-2023, Joe truly believes Reddick will spark the entire defensive line when it comes to throwing quarterbacks on the ground. It isn’t just Joe who thinks this was a dynamic move by Licht. So too does NFL Network analyst Bucky Brooks. In a column Brooks typed for NFL.com, Brooks included the Reddick signing as one of his “five perfect free agent marriages” last week. Haason Reddick OLB  Age: 30 CONTRACT: One year, $14 million, with $12 million guaranteed. After posting four consecutive 11-plus-sack seasons from 2020 to 2023, the speed-rushing demon should re-emerge as a premier playmaker in Tampa. Todd Bowles’ aggressive scheme should create more one-on-one opportunities for the ninth-year pro to win utilizing his superior speed, quickness and athleticism to overwhelm blockers on the edge. With an entire offseason to knock off any rust remaining from an extended holdout in 2024 (he recorded just one sack and three QB hits in 10 games with the Jets after returning to the field), the former Pro Bowler could be the X-factor that helps the Buccaneers make a deep playoff run this season. This is exactly what Joe has been beating up keyboards about for the past few months. Joe really, really believed the Bucs were an established quality edge rusher away from being a team that can make a Super Bowl run. Reddick is that guy if can recapture what made him an elite edge rusher in four of the previous five seasons.|2025-03-17 00:00:00|356|14|7|Haason Reddick|Reddick boosts Bucs' defense for potential playoff run.|4|Mixed sentiments with optimism, skepticism, and some confusion expressed by commenters.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""IrishPirate"", ""post"": ""Cheers to that!!! \ud83c\udf7b"", ""post_time"": [""March"", ""17th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""12:33"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""SlyPirate"", ""post"": ""This roster is going to be loaded by the start of the season."", ""post_time"": [""March"", ""17th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""2:12"", ""am""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""Oxycondomns"", ""post"": ""what the heck?"", ""post_time"": [""March"", ""17th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""2:33"", ""am""]}, ""commenter3"": {""username"": ""garro"", ""post"": ""That dress is sooo last season Dennis.
