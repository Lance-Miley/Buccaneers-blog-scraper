https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/baker-mayfield-gets-his-men/|Baker Mayfield Gets His Men|Sage of Tampa Bay Sports Ira Kaufman likes to say one thing in particular about the 2025 edition of Baker Mayfield.  “He’s callin’ a lot of shots at One Buc.” That may be a bit of hyperbole, but there’s plenty of truth to it. Mayfield got his offensive coordinator for the second consecutive season, and he got Chris Godwin back along with today’s news of receiver Sterling Shepard re-signing. And don’t forget Mayfield’s starting line is intact, though key O-line backups and Mayfield friends have left the building Robert Hainsey (Jacksonville) and Justin Skule (Minnesota). Shepard, 32, was Mayfield’s college teammate and buddy at Oklahoma. He was drafted by the Giants and became a fan favorite up there, and he also was known for his supermodel ex-wife. After various injuries, “Shep” was on the couch with no team last spring when Mayfield called him to see if he wanted a dance — a last dance? — with the Bucs. He did. Shepard got hurt in training camp and didn’t make the Bucs’ 53-man roster, but he was willing to play for practice squad money and got promoted quickly. Shepard finished with 32 catches for 334 yards with handful of big plays and stupid penalties. The latter drove fans crazy, but there is no denying Shepard is a very solid option as a No. 5(ish) receiver. He’ll compete with Trey Palmer and Todd Bowles-fave Rakim Jarrett for a spot behind Mike Evans, Godwin and Jalen McMillan. Bowles talked about personally scouting receivers at the NFL Scouting Combine, though Joe is dubious after today’s Shepard signing and Godwin’s chatter about hard practice this August. Joe agrees with Kaufman that Mayfield has a very heavy hand in a lot of things on his side of the ball. He should. He’s a young franchise quarterback the Bucs hope has at least another five seasons in Tampa.|2025-03-14 20:55:00|312|42|6|Baker Mayfield|Mayfield makes moves to strengthen Buccaneers' offense for upcoming season.|4|Mixed sentiments regarding Baker Mayfield's performance and draft priorities, with notable criticism and praise.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""FilthyAnimal"", ""post"": ""Shepard re-signing has ZERO bearing on the Bucs draft plans at receiver.

Haason Reddick took a couple of brisk steps toward the podium at the media studio inside One Buc Palace this morning, he greeted reporters and wore a smile. In Reddick’s mind, he wanted to put the past behind him. Specifically, Reddick didn’t want to discuss being traded from the Eagles to the Jets last year, his subsequent hold out, and a nightmare of a season that didn’t begin until October. “Very bizarre,” is how Reddick described his 2024 season with a chuckle. That was a line he repeated a couple of times. That was about the extent that he allowed reporters any insight into why the Jets turned out to be a nightmare for him. The Bucs didn’t bring Reddick in to be an afterthought like he was in the New Jersey Swamplands (one sack). Rather, the Bucs brought him to town because he had 50.5 sacks the previous four seasons for the Eagles, Panthers and Cardinals. A couple of times Reddick said he wanted to keep the past in the past and was just focused on the future. Joe hopes Reddick doesn’t put the past behind him. After two years in Arizona, Reddick was labeled a bust because Cardinals coaches thought he could be the next Derrick Brooks instead of a scary pass rusher. In his fourth year in the league, Arizona had a change of heart, moved him back to outside linebacker and allowed Reddick to release the hounds. Reddick responded with 12.5 sacks when he moved back to outside linebacker. Joe also hopes Reddick doesn’t forget how he walked on at Temple. Coming from a disadvantaged home, he overcame a lot of obstacles to eventually win a scholarship at the Philadelphia institution. Joe sure hopes Reddick doesn’t put that past behind him. Because that work ethic is why Reddick will getting paid this year if he lives up to his past history. If Reddick wants to forget the Jets, no problem. Just also remember the good of the past and how that helped mold him into the player he is.|2025-03-14 16:48:00|351|20|6|Haason Reddick|Reddick's past and future in football discussed with optimism and caution.|7|Optimistic reactions to Reddick's addition, high expectations for next season, positive outlook on defense.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""infomeplease"", ""post"": ""Let\u2019s face it, the Buc\u2019s have a great organization.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/connections-key-for-haason-reddick/|Connections Key For Haason Reddick|So new Bucs beastly (hopefully) edge rusher Haason Reddick met with Joe and other local media at One Buc Palace today and made a few things very clear. No. 1, Reddick is in Tampa because of his connections with Bucs coaches. In particular, Bucs outside linebackers coach Larry Foote spent two years around Reddick in Arizona, and Foote was a bit of mentor for the Cardinals’ first-round pick. While Reddick was pegged as an inside linebacker by then head coach Bruce Arians (his final season there), Foote was all over the versatile Reddick to learn how to get to the quarterback. After Foote moved on, the Cardinals finally made Reddick an edge rusher, what he was in college at Temple, and he exploded. No. 2, Reddick’s smile told a huge story when he was asked today about playing with Vita Vea and Calijah Kancey. And Joe will say a No. 3 message from Reddick is he wanted to play in a place that felt like home. A walk-on at Temple from a very tough southwest New Jersey city named Camden (is the Campbell’s soup factory still there?) Reddick said he’s known all kinds of adversity in his life and it feels routine to him. So his high-profile holdout mess with the Jets last season, after what he called business disagreements with the Eagles, isn’t something that set him back, he said. Reddick said he’s currently 6-1, 245 pounds and ready to the attack-dog violent edge rusher he’s known to be. His greatest strength? Reddick said it’s smarts. He knows how to win at the line of scrimmage. Joe will share more from Reddick later today.|2025-03-14 11:04:00|275|33|5|Haason Reddick|Reddick's connection with Bucs coaches and optimism about future.|8|Positive outlook on team improvements with new acquisitions and defensive strategy adjustments.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""WiscoJoe"", ""post"": ""Maybe it\u2019s PTSD from El Serpiente but I was getting worried when he didn\u2019t put pen to paper right away \u2026 very grateful he did though and that he\u2019s here.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/little-to-no-risk-for-bucs-signing-hasson-reddick/|Little To No Risk For Bucs Signing Haason Reddick|When Joe first saw the note from BSPN’s Adam Schefter that the Bucs and edge rusher Haason Reddick agreed to terms, Joe started thinking it was a weird Twilight Zone dinosaurs-in-Manhattan hallucination. Then, Joe thought Schefter was being punked by a fake Schefter account. You know the type; they spring up like mushrooms every year during free agency. When Joe finally realized it was real, Joe then pulled a Fred Sanford. Whenever he was shocked, he grabbed his heart thinking he was about to stroke out and reunite with his deceased wife, yelling, “ELIZABETH!” A dark stain on the Bucs franchise has finally been rectified. In fact, Joe just wants to celebrate this move by Bucs’ AC/DC-loving general manager Jason Licht. Speaking on NFL Network earlier this week, reporter Sara Walsh noted there is virtually no risk in the Bucs signing Reddick to what amounts to a bit more of a prove-it contract. “Baker Mayfield is an example on one of those [players the Bucs] had on [a prove-it contract], and then they had to pay Baker, but it was a prove-it deal, much like Hasson Reddick is going to be,” Walsh said. “So the risk-reward here isn’t huge here for the Buccaneers. It’s a one-year deal. “They really need some help pressuring the quarterback. They need help [at] edge rushers, and they’re going to get that. And they are going to hope that this is Reddick who’s very motivated after what happened last year with the Jets. Wants to come out here prove to everyone he’s deserving of a big time contract. And perhaps Jason Licht has struck gold again when it comes to finding these guys that you can plug in, that can impact this team immediately.” Joe really, really believes Reddick will make the Bucs’ pass rush all across the front line better. From YaYa Diaby to Calijah Kancey and Vita Vea. There simply aren’t many teams that have enough bodies on an offensive line to handle those four guys in a pass rush, provided Riddick returns to his former beastly self. One of those four is going to be attacked with just a single blocker.

Joe probably still won’t believe the Bucs got an edge rusher until actually seeing Reddick on a football field. If Joe wasn’t so jaded by the lack of pass rushers since Jason Pierre-Paul and Shaq Barrett were healthy, Joe should have seen a signing of an edge rusher coming by Bucs AC/DC-loving general manager Jason Licht’s own words at the combine last month in Indianapolis. Licht noted how young NFC South quarterbacks are a big topic at One Buc Palace. “We’ve been talking about this a lot,” Licht said. “In Carolina, Bryce Young really came on this year and showed why he was such a coveted pick. We think [Michael] Penix is a really good quarterback, a dynamic quarterback. He’s got a really good arm and is a smart guy. “[Young NFC quarterbacks are] keeping everybody on their edge. We have to continue to not just remain competitive but try to stay ahead.” And what better way to stay ahead and stay competitive against rising young quarterbacks? Get after their ass with a pass rush. Joe believes Reddick won’t just have a rebirth in Tampa Bay, he will make the Bucs’ pass rush across the line better.|2025-03-14 07:00:00|218|29|7|Jason Licht|Bucs boost pass rush to counter young NFC quarterbacks.|6|Fans are optimistic about Reddick but acknowledge the need for further defensive depth improvement.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Living in TB12's Shadow"", ""post"": ""We can only hope that Reddick is the missing piece to a pass rush.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/how-much-gas-in-the-tank-does-stephon-gilmore-have/|How Much Gas In The Tank Does Stephon Gilmore Have?|Yeah, Joe knows the Bucs signed a Lions cornerback yesterday. This brings Joe to the following question: The Lions lost Carlton Davis to free agency. If this Kindle Vildor was any good, why didn’t the Lions keep him? Of course, Detroit has a new defensive coordinator. Maybe Vildor doesn’t fit well there now? And Joe is confident Bucs coach Todd Bowles got good intel on Vildor from his good friend, Lions coach Dan Campbell. Joe still isn’t satisfied and wants more help at corner, which brings Joe to veteran corner Stephon Gilmore. Yeah, Gilmore has been around the block. He’s 34. And Bowles at the combine said over and over again he wants ballhawks. Gilmore is no longer a ballhawk. He hasn’t had more than two picks in a season since he led the NFL with six playing for the Belicheats. Gilmore did start 15 games for a playoff team last year, the Vikings. How bad could he be? Perhaps Gilmore has just enough gas in the tank to start six games or so? We know if Jamel Dean is still on the roster come September, it’s pretty clear he will miss games.
