https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/tristan-wirfs-returns-to-training-rehab-on-monday/|Tristan Wirfs Returns To Training, Rehab On Monday|Most offensive lineman take a beating through a season. That includes Bucs All-Pro left tackle Tristan Wirfs, who sprained his knee early in November against the 49ers and also dealt with an ankle issue. So Wirfs has been enjoying rest and relaxation since the Bucs’ season ended but that extended chill ends next week. “I’ll start training on Monday, slowly get back into it, moving around,” Wirfs told WDAE. “Getting back in the rehab and everything. Feeling good. It’s nice to take a little time off.” Joe’s glad it sounds like Wirfs doesn’t have any lingering issues. And Wirfs will have his training buddy waiting for him, Bucs right tackle Luke Goedeke. Per Wirfs, Goedeke already has resumed mauling in the gym. Joe can only imagine how jacked up Goedeke will be entering the final year of his rookie contract.|2025-02-08 12:28:00|140|29|6|Tristan Wirfs|Wirfs returns to training after injury for upcoming football season.|6|Mix of cautious optimism and slight concerns about player health and draft strategy.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Pickgrin"", ""post"": ""How is it even possible that 3 Tackles came off the board before this guy???"", ""post_time"": [""February"", ""8th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""12:50"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Pryda30"", ""post"": ""Good for him It\u2019s kind of crazy that he\u2019s already starting a train for the following season but that\u2019s why he\u2019s an all pro #Greatness"", ""post_time"": [""February"", ""8th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""12:52"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""LouisFriend"", ""post"": ""As long as his medicals look good \u2013 extend Goedke this offseason.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/we-know-what-we-need-to-fix/|“We Know What We Need To Fix”|So many NFL players descend upon the Super Bowl site every year, this time New Orleans, and wander through the media center where one can find radio row. Bucs running back Rachaad White stopped in to chat with Baker Machado of Front Office Sports. There, White talked about the season that was and his look at the Bucs for 2025. “Our expectations are high,” White said. “They were high this year. “We let a couple of close games slip. We felt like we should have won. It came down to the wire. “And then, obviously, we let the last game of the season slip. It came down to the wire. But you have to give credit where it is do.” How much different would the season had been if the Bucs were able to take care of business in Atlanta and Kansas City, and even at home against San Francisco? Joe still cannot blame players for the Kansas City loss in overtime. The Bucs were down Mike Evans and Chris Godwin and still had a chance for a game-winning score in their last possession of regulation. “We know what we need to fix,” White said. “We need to build on [last season]. “We got new changes once again in our building. This is my fourth year with a new OC. But I’m pretty sure you can lean on Baker because of what he has been through.” It stinks for White that Liam Coen left. White easily had his best season running the ball. Can White build on that? Will new offensive coordinator Josh Grizzard be able to reignite White’s strong skills in the pass game? Time will only tell.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/mark-wahlberg-infatuated-with-baker-mayfield/|Mark Wahlberg “Infatuated” With Baker Mayfield|Lots of nuggets come from Media Row at the Super Bowl. Joe’s got a bunch to share over the next few weeks.  It’s a place where the entertainment world and the NFL cross paths a bit and Joe got this one from the Dumb Zone podcast. So actor/comedian Jeremy Piven, the Entourage star, is a big football fan and explained on this show that he loves Baker Mayfield and called him “one of the real ones.” Naturally, Piven was then asked how Mayfield got on his radar. “You know, doing Entourage, and [Mark] Wahlberg is infatuated with him. I don’t know how I got on his radar; I was somehow in Cleveland doing [standup] shows. … And I was in Cleveland and just connected with Baker when he was playing with them. And he’s one of these guys who like came out to the show. He shows up. He’s not one of these guys who says, ‘I’ll be there,’ and doesn’t show up.” Piven went on to ramble about Mayfield’s drive and football IQ. The tide certainly is turning for Mayfield when it comes to national perception. No, not because some Hollywood dudes have a man crush. Mayfield has gone from castoff joke in the minds of national NFL pundits to a quarterback worthy of a degree of respect. A strong 2025 season from Mayfield should remove the unwarranted lingering stink and doubt from the all national conversations about him. At that point, the Bucs might have a beloved and bonafide celebrity as their franchise QB.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/todd-bowles-doesnt-care-what-outsiders-think/|Todd Bowles Doesn’t Care What Outsiders Think|The Kirk Cousins drumbeat began about 11 months ago after the first wave of free agency. The Dixie Chicks signed Cousins. The Bucs, who some thought would win just two games (!) the prior, were toast. They’re run is over. Perhaps the most underachieving Pro Bowl quarterback in the NFL, Cousins was supposed to lead the Dixie Chicks to the Super Bowl. Good times in Atlanta. This was barked over and over and over and over again through October. Something funny happened along the way. The Dixie Chicks stunk. Cousins was beaten up and eventually benched. In a playoff run! Who benches the next Hall of Fame quarterback in a playoff run? (Please note Joe’s sarcasm.) The Bucs won 10 games and another division title. So they exceeded expectations, right? Bowles scoffed at this last month and bluntly said what someone in Los Angeles or Cincinnati or New England — who has never been to a Bucs training camp practice or ever sat inside One Buc Palace — has to say about his team means nothing to him. “We underachieved as far as ourselves are concerned,” Bowles said. “We don’t worry about external expectations. Our internal expectations were for us to go to the Super Bowl. “Injury or regardless, our internal expectations are to go to the Super Bowl. We did not get that accomplished. “We did some good things throughout the year, yes. We had guys injured, yes. We got to the playoffs, yes but our expectations are to win the Super Bowl.” Tomorrow is the Super Bowl but the Bucs were bounced at home in the wild card round. Bowles has said this offseason is time for reflection. How can he be a better coach? How can the Bucs be a better team. Well, a starting point is very simple to Joe: Go get a friggin’ edge rusher.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/josh-grizzard-receives-tristan-wirfs-stamp-of-approval/|Josh Grizzard Receives Tristan Wirfs’ Stamp Of Approval|OK, so Joe is going to do some dot-connecting here. Joe might be off, but perhaps not. If Baker Mayfield had an issue with new Bucs offensive coordinator Josh Grizzard or didn’t like him or didn’t think Grizzard could get the job done running the Bucs offense, Grizzard might still be a “passing game coordinator.” Or he might just be in Jacksonville. Bucs All-Pro tackle Tristan Wirfs and Mayfield are very tight. The two are great friends and if they’re not at home, they’re either at One Buc Palace or they are hanging out somewhere or fishing. So Joe doesn’t believe Wirfs would rave about Grizzard being his new coordinator if Mayfield told him Grizzard was a mistake of a hire. Speaking with Ari Meirov of The33rdTeam, Wirfs seemed genuinely pumped to have Grizzard taking over for the departed Liam Coen. “We’re excited bout ‘Griz,’ too,” Wirfs said. “He was here this year. Knows the system like the back of his hand. “He’s a wizard. It’s going to be fun.” That’s comforting. Joe doesn’t know he excited to be about Grizzard because he has very big shoes to fill. And Joe is suspicious a first-time play-caller can actually make an offense more explosive than the third-best offense in the game. Joe is keen on seeing what sort of wrinkles Grizzard can work into the offense he inherited.  |2025-02-08 00:00:00|227|17|5|Josh Grizzard|Tristan Wirfs praises Grizzard as new offensive coordinator.|6|Overall, the sentiment is cautiously optimistic with some concerns about high expectations for the new OC.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""ReeeBarrr"", ""post"": ""Psyched to see it play out!"", ""post_time"": [""February"", ""8th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""12:10"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""White Tiger"", ""post"": ""I keep hearing folks focus on Grizzard comments about making this offense more explosive than last season.
