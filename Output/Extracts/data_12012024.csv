https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/bucky-irving-on-pace-for-1037-yards-rushing-a-bucs-record/|Bucky Irving On Pace For 1,037 Yards Rushing & A Bucs Record|Some easily could argue that Bucky Irving is on pace for the greatest season ever by a Buccaneers running back. Yeah, it’s been that good. Rookie Irving was a monster today in the breakout game of his career against Carolina — 25 carries for 152 yards and his 6th rushing touchdown of the season. Irving is averaging 5.5 yards per carry. That’s 732 yards on 133 carries with 5 games remaining. If that continues, Irving will finish with the best yards-per-carry average in a Buccaneers season by a full-time running back. Yes, Irving would have a more efficient rushing season than any delivered by Doug Martin, James Wilder, Warrick Dunn, LeGarrette Blount and more. During the Bucs’ last Super Bowl season, Ronald Jones ran for 5.1 yards per carry, which was a new high in a Tampa Bay season. Jones also had 7 touchdowns on the ground in 2020. Leonard “Playoff Lenny” Fournette got the headlines, but RoJo carried most of the mail. Irving has been better than all those guys, all those special seasons. Oh, and Irving also leads the NFL in catch percentage, hauling in 95 percent of the balls thrown his way. That includes three receptions today for 33 yards. At 8.1 yards per catch, Irving has been better than Rachaad White as a receiver this season. And Irving is on pace for 50 catches. Enjoy it, folks. Joe sure is. And pray Irving’s hip is ok.|2024-12-01 22:23:00|240|29|9|Bucky Irving|Breakout season for Bucs rookie running back Bucky Irving.|6|Mixed feelings on running backs, injuries, coaching decisions.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/ira-kaufmans-10-takeaways-from-bucs-panthers-8/|Ira Kaufman’s 10 Takeaways From Bucs-Panthers|BY IRA KAUFMAN Had it all the way. The Bucs took advantage of some major breaks to avoid a broken heart Sunday during a 26-23 OT victory at Charlotte that left Carolina fans stunned and Buc Nation elated. The Panthers had the better of play for much of the afternoon before dynamic rookie Bucky Irving took command and Baker Mayfield rebounded from what looked like a serious leg injury. The result, coupled with a loss by the reeling Falcons, leaves Tampa Bay and Atlanta tied atop the NFC South at 6-6. The Falcons own the tie-breaker edge with five games remaining, but the schedule favors the Bucs and Kirk Cousins is playing so poorly, the calls for rookie Michael Penix Jr. under center are sure to grow. The Panthers have been playing good football for a month now under former Bucs OC Dave Canales — and it showed. Carolina led 13-10 at the half but could have easily been up double digits if not for two makeable field goals that were missed and a potential TD catch by Adam Thielen that was ruled incomplete and upheld upon review. The Bucs looked sloppy and lethargic in the opening 30 minutes, going 0-for-5 on third down and committing thoughtless penalties. Then it was Irving to the rescue as he rushed for 116 of his 152 yards after the half before being sidelined by a hip-pointer. Thielen got his revenge with a scoring catch that gave the Panthers a 23-20 advantage with only 30 seconds remaining in regulation, but Mayfield drove Tampa Bay into FG range for Chase McLaughlin. In OT, Thielen’s sensational one-handed reception gave Carolina a first down at the Buc 34. All appeared lost before Anthony Nelson stepped up with the game’s biggest defensive play, stripping the ball from Chuba Hubbard. YaYa Diaby fell on the loose ball as Buc fans rejoiced Mike Evans and Rachaad White then sparked a game-winning drive as the Bucs evened their division record at 2-2. Coming off an OT setback against the Chiefs, Carolina walked off the field demoralized. The Panthers had this game in their grasp — until they didn’t — and the Bucs realize they got away with a pedestrian effort. Here’s how Tampa Bay kept hope alive, knowing a 4-1 stretch run will likely be good enough for a fourth consecutive division title: * With his 28 touches, Irving responded with 185 yards from scrimmage, repaying Liam Coen’s confidence in a fourth-round steal. He’s averaging 5.5 yards per carry and Irving is only 268 yards away from a 1,000-yard rushing season. Only that troublesome hip-pointer stands in his way. * Nelson played a strong game overall with six tackles and three QB hits against Bryce Young, who has looked like a different quarterback in the past month, throwing only one pick in that span. Overall, the Buc pass rush was underwhelming, although Calijah Kancey had a few standout moments. * While the run blocking was stellar, Tampa Bay’s offensive line rarely gave Mayfield a clean pocket. He was sacked four times and Carolina’s pressure contributed to two interceptions. Although the Bucs rolled up 445 yards, they converted only 2-of-12 on the money down and scored only two TDs in five trips to the red zone. * Coen’s worst call of the day came with the Bucs clinging to a 17-16 lead with 3:15 left in regulation. They faced third-and-1 at the Carolina 2-yard line, with a chance to go up eight points. White carried wide to the left and was stopped for a 6-yard loss as the dejected Bucs settled for a FG. Even analyst Mark Schlereth, not known for pointed comments, couldn’t believe the Bucs didn’t call for a run between the tackles. * Evans came up big time and again with 118 yards on his eight catches. He gave the Bucs an early 7-0 lead when he reached up with his right hand and hauled in Mayfield’s high fade pass to the left corner of the end zone while keeping both feet inbounds. We’ve seen No. 13 do it before, but you have to appreciate how he made an exceedingly difficult catch look routine. * The first half was almost unwatchable. There were penalties galore, missed tackles, missed field goals and a general lack of precision from both teams. Where was Tampa Bay’s sense of urgency? * For the second consecutive week, Chris Izien may have been Tampa Bay’s best defensive back. The kid can play. * Buc fans shouldn’t take McLaughlin for granted. His 51-yarder that tied the score on the final snap of regulation was clutch. On the rare times he misses a kick, it’s a shock. * You had to wonder what Kyle Trask was thinking when Mayfield re-entered the game after sitting out only two snaps injured and promptly threw a pick that set the Panthers up at the Tampa Bay 20. Trask had just attempted a single pass, matching his total for last season. * The Bucs have been established as 7-point favorites at home against the Raiders, who have dropped eight in a row. You can bet Todd Bowles will train his focus on rookie tight end Brock Bowers, off to a terrific start in the pros. Meanwhile, Coen will try to find a way to contain game-wrecker Maxx Crosby. who has 34.5 sacks and 86 QB hits since 2022. Other than those two studs, the Raiders stink. |2024-12-01 22:09:00|905|28|6|Ira Kaufman|Bucs win OT game in struggle|3|Mixed sentiment with some optimism towards individual players but pessimism towards overall team performance.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Dew"", ""post"": ""I thought Coen said our 3rd string running back would get more carries?"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""1st,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""10:17"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Ed"", ""post"": ""This game wasn\u2019t anything to get excited about unless your last name is Irving.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/jason-licht-expresses-urgency-should-be-fuming/|Jason Licht Expresses Urgency, Should Be Fuming|Buccaneers Ring of Honor general manager Jason Licht has handed his head coach a stellar young offensive line, an upper tier quarterback, a Hall of Fame receiver, a Pro Bowl rookie running back, the best kicker in Bucs history and a load of talent on defense. And still the Bucs struggle. Man, if Joe were Licht, Joe would be ready to punch multiple people in the face. The patience of Mr. Licht is incredible. Yeah, Licht has issues when it comes to finding an edge rush and the 2024 nside linebacker situaton is bizarre, but Joe can’t find a lot of flaws for a roster-builder still paying off a Super Bowl on the Bucs’ salary cap. Before today’s game, Joe heard the urgency in Licht’s voice on the Buccaneers Radio Network. “We’ve got to win. Our backs are against the wall. There’s no room for error,” Licht said. The GM added that this Bucs roster tends to to play well in backs-against-the-wall situations. While that certainly didn’t happen as a unit today against the Panthers, some of those studs Licht put in Bowles’ cupboard had a hell of a day. Man, Joe looks at the talent differential between the Bucs and Panthers and wants to puke. The Bucs should have beaten Carolina by two scores on paper. But in reality, they were lucky not to lose. Licht delivered a little hope for the future in his pregame chat. “Hopefully Jordan [Whitehead] can come back,” Licht said of his injured starting safety. “We can make the playoffs and he can come back.”|2024-12-01 21:53:00|261|38|4|Jason Licht|Struggles and hope for Buccaneers' future|5|Mixed sentiment with criticism of coaching and performance, some optimism about talent and potential.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Winny Testaverde"", ""post"": ""I think maybe some see Licht and the current Bucs roster through a rose colored funhouse mirror."", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""1st,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""10:00"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""All_da_way"", ""post"": ""A road win against a divisional opponent is tough.

The Stinking Panthers have the third-worst yards-per-game allowed average in the NFL (the Bucs are the fourth-worst). So a team ought to be able to move the ball on such a cotton candy-soft defense, right? Well, not exactly. Not the sleepwalking Bucs today. The Bucs, with a superior quarterback, a superior offensive line, a superior running attack and with a future Hall of Fame receiver, acted on third downs as if they were facing the 2002 Bucs defense. The Bucs converted on just 16 percent of their third downs. Yes, 16 percent! The Bucs found themselves in 12 third down predicaments. They converted just two. TWO! How?

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/not-pretty-by-any-means/|“Not Pretty By Any Means”|Hey, what happened to the old adage that says any NFL road win is a thing of beauty? Well, whoever wrote that hasn’t suffered through numerous 2024 Panthers games like Joe has, including today’s. It’s a bad Panthers team, one that already traded multiple good players to prepare for the 2025 NFL Draft. And the Panthers’ suckage was further highlighted today by conservative playcalling by their head coach (thanks, Dave!) and a brutal kicking game. Still, Joe is hearing it from fans annoyed because Joe is not doing cartwheels down Dale Mabry Highway after a thrilling Bucs overtime victory, a breakout game by the Bucs’ special young running back and a legendary Bucs rushing day. Ok. Joe gets it. A win is a win and it feels 100 times better than a loss. But there were serious issues on the field. Heck, even Baker Mayfield himself sounded exasperated during his postgame interview on FOX. “Not pretty by any means,” Mayfield said of the win, noting many offensive penalties and his own crappy plays. It’s ok to win ugly. But it’s December and the season is — and was — on the line. The Bucs have to play better. Joe knows it. The Bucs know it.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/what-got-into-sterling-shepard/|What Got Into Sterling Shepard?|[UPDATE 10:16 p.m.] Video has surfaced on social media of a Bucs staffer and a Bucs security member holding back wide receiver Sterling Shepard from going after some Stinking Panthers players. It was after the Bucs’ win in overtime today at Charlotte. The Bucs were in the bowels of Bank of America Stadium heading to the locker room where Shepard was hollering at Stinking Panthers players and started walking toward them (Joe couldn’t see them from the video). Shepard, instead of heading to the locker room, did a 180 and started walking toward the voices. It appears the man who physically stopped Shepard is long-time Bucs vice president of player engagement Duke Preston. This Preston is no pushover. He’s a former Illinois center who had a brief stint with the Bills. He then became a player counselor with Notre Dame before getting his current gig. Joe has no idea what sparked Shepard’s reaction, but good thing Preston and Bucs security were around to get into Shepard’s path and steer him to the Bucs locker room. Per FOX Sports Radio Carolina beat writer Sheena Quick, Stinking Panthers safety Sam Franklin was running smack at Bucs outside linebacker Jose Ramirez. which seemed to predicate Shepard’s outburst. Joe won’t embed the video here because Shepard used adult language, but here’s a direct link. Man, Rachaad White wasn’t kidding when he said Bucs coaches say Shepard needs supervision. [UPDATE 10:16 p.m.] It seems Tim Weaver of SI.com has some more, but not a whole lot more, on what took place in this postgame hassle. Though Weaver didn’t have any specifics about what sparked the hassles, it seems Stinking Panthers safety Sam Franklin was incensed enough he tried to charge the entrance to the Bucs locker room. Video in this link shows Franklin being dragged away from near the Bucs’ locker room entrance. Weaver also typed that whatever the hollering was about, it was Shepard who tried to get at Franklin for trying to get into the Bucs locker room. Now Joe has been outside a lot of NFL locker rooms over the year and for any player thinking he could barge into an opponent’s locker room without first getting permission is hilarious because team security and the cops would tackle someone that would make Derrick Brooks smile.|2024-12-01 21:16:00|383|15|3|Sterling Shepard|Altercation between players after Bucs vs Panthers game.|6|Mixed reactions to player behavior, some supportive, others concerned about potential consequences.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Ben the GA Buc"", ""post"": ""Like the attitude.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/career-high-completions-for-bryce-young/|Career-High Completions For Bryce Young|So the Bucs had only one official pass defensed today, a huge one by Zyon McCollum, while sad Panthers quarterback Bryce Young had a career high 26 completions and 20 incompletions. What happened? All together now, “Soft zone meets no edge rush.” Joe is aging rapidly through this gut-wrenching Bucs season. The way the Bucs make so many quarterbacks look special is astounding. Consider that Kirk Cousins has thrown 9 touchdown passes and 12 interceptions in the 10 games he’s played that were not against Tampa Bay. Versus the Bucs, Cousins has 8 TD throws and 1 interception through two Falcons victories. Does anyone think that’s a coincidence? Joe was hopeful today with Calijah Kancey and Vita Vea entering the game hot and the Bucs having starting cornerbacks Jamel Dean and Zyon McCollum back healthy for the second consecutive game. But the pass defense was the same old sad story, though it looked slighly less ugly because the Panthers’ have subpar receivers overall. Joe admits that losing safety Mike Edwards early in the game (hamstring) looked like a significant loss since Edwards had made a couple of plays, but that’s a bit of a reach. If the Bucs hope to do anything special this season, Todd Bowles has to re-think his soft-zone, off-coverage pass defense.|2024-12-01 21:12:00|215|23|2|Bryce Young|Bucs struggling in pass defense against Panthers.|3|Mixed sentiments with some optimism but overall leaning towards pessimism.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Lightningvinny"", ""post"": ""Call Rosenhouse , see if he can get us a 32 year old pass rusher that in the past helped us win a Super Bowl ,,    See if he knows a punter too"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""1st,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""9:16"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Sheen"", ""post"": ""Vin \u2013 Shaq can\u2019t play for anyone else this season\u2026Fins won\u2019t release him"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""1st,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""9:18"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""Sheen"", ""post"": ""We also lost Britt which really put our pass defense in a bind"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""1st,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""9:20"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter3"": {""username"": ""Beeej"", ""post"": ""lol"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""1st,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""9:24"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter4"": {""username"": ""DBS"", ""post"": ""1 sack by accident.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/bucs-dodged-a-major-major-bullet/|Bucs Dodged A Major, Major Bullet|The Joe typing this here post has been a monster fan of Bucs offensive coordinator Liam Coen for the job he did this season, sometimes under trying circumstances. “This Joe” has been impressed to the point of being convinced Coen will be a head coach somewhere next year, college or NFL. However, Coen needs to find a way for the NFL and/or FOX to destroy any evidence of the Bucs offense today with the exception of their first drive and last drive. Coen made questionable decisions most of the game, gaffes Joe was not expecting to come from a guy like Coen. His biggest error damn near cost the Bucs their playoff dreams. Second half, third-and-one, just over four minutes left in the third quarter. On the previous possession, Baker Mayfield was sacked to end the drive and in the process, had his right foot stomped on by Jadeveon Clowney. Mayfield could barely get off the field on his own. When he sat on the bench and had to get back up to enter the peep show medical tent, Mayfield had to rock like a mental patient back and forth just to gain steam to stand up. So on the next Bucs possession, after a solid run by Bucky Irving and a short pass to Irving, it was third-and-one and Coen put Mayfield back in the game. Even with the bum ankle on his plant foot. Who knows what trainers shot him up with for the pain? So the smart move would be to feed Irving the ball. Irving was hotter than a firecracker. Instead, Coen called for Mayfield to pass, and the throw ended in a pick by Stinking Panthers safety Xavier Woods. That led to a field goal putting Carolina up by a touchdown 16-10 Why in the world did Coen call for a pass? Your quarterback just got hurt. He hurt his plant foot. Again, who knows what his ankle was shot up with? And with a running back who was hotter than Rachel Watson, you have your cold, hurt quarterback throw when you only need one measly yard? Why? That massive brainfart came really, really, really close to Pearl Harboring the Bucs’ season. (The usage/non-usage of Irving at critical times of the game late and into overtime is another story. But to be fair to Coen, here is video of Irving walking off the field after the game with some sort of bodywrap around his midsection and he hollered, “F’ no!” when asked if he was alright.) “This Joe” still thinks Coen will be a head coach next year. But now he’s going to have to hatch a convincing dodge of an answer to the question, “What the hell were you doing against the Stinking Panthers, man?”|2024-12-01 20:52:00|461|35|2|Liam Coen|Coen's questionable decisions nearly cost Bucs their playoff dreams.|4|Mixed sentiments about coaches and players, some critical, some optimistic, and some questioning decisions.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Chris from Gainesville"", ""post"": ""Also the shirt passes to RBs.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/rollercoaster-game-for-baker-mayfield/|Rollercoaster Game For Baker Mayfield|He threw two ugly interceptions and ate an overtime sack that simply cannot happen. And there was more on the negative side for Baker Mayfield today against the Panthers, but the Bucs’ quarterback also hit six targets, escaped a pass rush and ran for a critical first down with seconds remaining in regulation. Plus, Mayfield recovered from an in-game injury and had money throws in overtime and the fourth quarter with the season on the line. In short, Mayfield was all over the place and didn’t have a great game, but he delivered true franchise-quarterback moments. The Bucs (6-6) rose up to tie the Falcons (6-6) atop the NFC South and win their second consecutive road game against a sad but scrappy Panthers team. Mayfield now has 25 TD throws and 11 interceptions this season with 3,034 yards passing and a completion rate over 70 percent. He also has blown away his prior career high in rushing yards. Last week, Joe enjoyed a serious and lively panel discussion on FS1 that revolved around whether Baker Mayfield deserves to be the No. 6-ranked quarterback in the NFL, or whether that should go to Lamar Jackson. Fun stuff. No, Joe doesn’t see Mayfield in that tier of quarterbacks, but he’s top-10 and Joe’s damn glad the Bucs aren’t quarterbacked by Kirk Cousins.|2024-12-01 20:43:00|220|26|5|Baker Mayfield|Rollercoaster game highlights Mayfield's ups and downs.|4|Mixed reactions with some positivity but overall critical and questioning player performance and coaching.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""adam from ny"", ""post"": ""i got older, grayer and balder in just 60 minutes\u2026"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""1st,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""8:49"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""adam from ny"", ""post"": ""make that 70 minutes   \ud83d\ude42"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""1st,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""8:50"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""74 Bucs Fan"", ""post"": ""I blinked and missed Trask playing.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/bucs-defense-was-clutch-as-usual-for-the-opponent/|Bucs Defense Was Clutch As Usual — For The Opponent|Anthony Nelson saved the season. That’s great, but for Joe, it’s like a dude standing in the middle of his burning house hollering, “It’s fine, it’s all fine!” One fantastic play for the ages isn’t going to make Joe forget the s(p)it show Joe witnessed this afternoon. Again. The Bucs defense was on the cusp of giving up its fourth loss of the season on the final Stinking Panthers drive of the game. Then Nelson rose up, stripped a ball from Chubba Hubbard, and YaYa Diaby pounced on it and held on for dear life. That play may have saved the Bucs’ season. Joe knows this was a win, but man, if this came against Baltimore or Pittsburgh or Kansas City, that’s one thing. But dang, the Bucs had to fight for their very lives — against the Stinking Panthers! Good grief! Credit to the Bucs offense on the second drive of overtime after the Nelson strip. Rachaad White had one of his best runs in a long time to set up a chip shot field goal by Chase McLaughlin. Still, against a garbage team like the Stinking Panthers, the edge rush couldn’t breathe on Bryce Young? In the abstract, this doesn’t surprise Joe because even the Bucs’ defensive line coach less than a month ago admitted the Bucs don’t care about an edge rush. But to play so flaccidly on defense as to not have any edge rush against a quarterback who was benched this year, well, Joe’s at wit’s end and has reached the very bottom of his deep well of patience about an edge rush. That is coaching malpractice and that twisted mentality about not caring about sacks from the edge damn near sunk the Bucs’ pirate ship today. “They didn’t blink, they fought,” Bucs coach Todd Bowles said of his defense in the fourth quarter and overtime. They may not have blinked because they were sleepwalking. Joe can never remember being close to angry after a win. But that’s right about where Joe is right now. There is no way in hell with all that was at stake for this Bucs team that they shouldn’t have destroyed the Stinking Panthers. The Bucs won. They probably shouldn’t have and likely wouldn’t have playing like that against any other team. This defense has a long way to go if the Bucs want to make any kind of postseason dent.|2024-12-01 20:22:00|401|55|2|Bucs Defense|Nelson's play saved game but defense criticized for weak performance.|3|Mixed sentiments with criticism toward coaching decisions and defensive performance, questioning the future of Bowles.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Buc Nutty"", ""post"": ""AGREED!!

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/playoffs-creep-closer/|Playoffs Creep Closer|Do the Bucs look like a contender? Who cares? They are a contender. After today’s freak show in Charlotte, the Bucs have won back-to-back road games and climbed their way back to 6-6. The NFC South title is a clear path now. It’s the Bucs and the Falcons to the death. Atlanta imploded today and fell to 6-6 while the slimy Saints did the same to drop their record to 4-8. The talent-challenged Panthers are 3-9. The Bucs’ remaning opponents are the Raiders, Panthers and Saints at home, and struggling Dallas and the Chargers the road. Atlanta heads next to Minnesota, before coming home for the Raiders and Giants. Then they head to Washington and close at home against the Panthers. The Bucs have an easier schedule, but do they have enough heart and coaching to beat the teams they should? Joe would bet a few nickels on the Bucs winning the division outright. They’ve got a better quarterback than Atlanta and more talent across the roster. Man, Joe would love to see the Bucs host the Vikings in the Wild Card round.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/do-the-bucs-have-the-best-running-game-in-the-nfl/|Do The Bucs Have The Best Running Game In The NFL?|Joe was flashing back to the 1990s this afternoon and slamming shots in ecstasy. It had nothing to do with Trent Dilfer and everything to do with the Bucs running the ball 39 times for 236 yards and a TD. Dammit, the Bucs might have the best rushing attacking in the NFL. Somewhere, Jon Gruden was drinking watered down American beer and screaming, “Pound The Rock.” Yes, Carolina has a terrible run defense, but this was their worst beatdown of the season on the ground. The Bucs relentlessly hammered away for 6.1 yards per carry and the Panthers had no answer. And it wasn’t just Bucky Irving. The Bucs ran right and left and up the gut. Rachaad White capped off overtime with a 38-yard scamper to set up the winning kick. The Bucs entered today’s game ranked No. 4 in the NFL in yards per carry. They might be No. 2 when the NFL week ends. Joe hasn’t seen a Tampa Bay run game like this since 2015. And this one keeps improving as the season marches on. It certainly helps when your entire offensive line is 27 years old and younger. If running the ball wins games in December and January, then the Bucs are in fine shape.|2024-12-01 20:11:00|210|29|9|The Bucs|Dominant running game leads to potential NFL ranking increase.|3|Fans are concerned about Bucky's usage and team's defense.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Oxycondomns"", ""post"": ""feeling bucky might not play next game. him returning kicks not smart."", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""1st,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""8:12"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Trask To The Future"", ""post"": ""ONLY ONE BUCS QB HAS 100% COMPLETION RATE"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""1st,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""8:13"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""Erik w/ UniqueModernArt.com"", ""post"": ""If Tucker got R White\u2019s carries, we would DEFINITELY have the best rushing attack in the NFL."", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""1st,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""8:14"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter3"": {""username"": ""OrlandoBucFan"", ""post"": ""Love the run game.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/survival-3/|Survival|This doesn’t even feel like a win for “this Joe.” Yeah, the Bucs won. All that matters is eating W’s. But it feels like cleaning up a bunch of puke. This game sucked. If it wasn’t for the Stinking Panthers being, well, stinky, this would have likely been a playoff-dreams-ending loss. And if we’re all frank, it should have been. The offense mostly stunk. Really, really questionable playcalls and personnel usage (non-usage) from an otherwise excellent Bucs offensive coordinator Liam Coen. As always, zero edge rush whatsoever, which has reached unforgivable sin-levels by the entire Bucs organization, from Team Glazer all the way down to the towel boys. Shaky special teams play at the worst possible time. Anthony Nelson should never have to buy a drink in the greater Tampa Bay area until the 2025s eason begins because he single-handedly saved the 2024 Bucs season. Joe could go on. It’s a win. Thank goodness for that. It feels like a loss. This team has serious problems if this is how it responds with a chance to tie the Dixie Chicks for the NFC South lead with five games to go, even if the playoffs are still in sight. With so much at stake, this game shouldn’t have been remotely close. Kudos on the win, but damn guys, you have a month’s worth of work to clean up in just a few days.|2024-12-01 20:00:00|232|54|2|Joe|Conflicted feelings about a lackluster football game.|4|Mixed feelings about the win, with criticism of the performance and coaching.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Tbbucs3"", ""post"": ""\u201c With so much at stake, this game shouldn\u2019t have been remotely close\u201d"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""1st,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""8:04"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Ds"", ""post"": ""Never apologize for winning sure we can clean stuff up but a win is a win"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""1st,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""8:04"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""Alvin Scissors Harper"", ""post"": ""If the normally reliable kicker for the Panthers makes his field goals, or the refs don\u2019t screw the Panthers on the Thielen TD, which was a TD, we lose.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/hall-of-fame-game-from-mike-evans/|Hall Of Fame Game From Mike Evans|Amazing, amazing stuff from Mike Evans today, even while not being fully healthy from his injured hamstring.  But he’s healthy Joe? No, he’s not. That’s the only explanation why the Bucs haven’t thrown Evans a deep shot in weeks. Regardless, Evans was there for huge catches against the Panthers seemingly whenever Baker Mayfield needed him. He finished with 8 catches on 12 targets for 118 yards and 1 TD, including one of the greatest grabs you’ll ever see. (Video below). It was Evans early, and it was Evans in overtime on a critical third down. And Evans’ mere presence helps open up the running game for Bucky Irving to dominate, and for Rachaad White’s overtime heroics. Thanks, Mike!

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/buccaneers-23-panthers-23-ot/|Buccaneers 26, Panthers 23 (OT)|Damn, this game took years off Joe’s life. Wow! No style points for the Bucs today, but what a special day for electric rookie running back Bucky Irving, Mike Evans, money kicker Chase McLaughlin and game hero Anthony Nelson, whose overtime forced fumble might have saved the season. Irving hammered away in the second half to rack up 24 carries for 158 yards and a touchdown in regulation. It’s about damn time the Bucs freed him up for true bellcow work. But with a chance to put the game away late in the fourth quarter, the Bucs went with handing off to Rachaad White. What??? It turned out to be a recipe for a Bucs field goal that led to the Panthers exposing the Bucs’ Charmin-soft pass defense. But Baker Mayfield got the ball back down three points with 30 seconds remaining and three timeouts. He executed beautifully, franchise-quarterback stuff, to set up the 51-yard overtime-forcing field goal by McLauglin. White, however, was the overtime dagger with a big run to set up the game-winning field goal. Good for him. Too-often lifeless and mistake-prone was the Bucs offense, though, with Mayfield throwing two brutal interceptions that would have cost the Bucs if they were playing a decent team. But they were not playing a good team, which has been a theme of the past month. The Bucs were to close the season with a pumpkin-pie-soft schedule that included the sad Panthers twice. Carolina simply does not have the necessary talent, as evidenced today. Still, the Panthers hung with the Bucs, which was embarrassing. But a win is a win, and the Bucs are tied for the NFC South lead at 6-6 with the Falcons. Wow. Just wow.|2024-12-01 19:46:00|287|101|5|Buccaneers|Bucs narrowly win over Panthers in overtime nail-biter.|6|Mixed reactions with concerns about defense, Mayfield, and coaching but some optimism and relief.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Austin"", ""post"": ""Todd still \ud83d\udca9 the bed"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""1st,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""7:47"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""D-Mac"", ""post"": ""The scarecrow, Bowles, still needs to go."", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""1st,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""7:47"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""Tbbucs3"", ""post"": ""Anthony Nelson saved the season!"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""1st,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""7:47"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter3"": {""username"": ""Leopold Stotch"", ""post"": ""Oh my God \ud83d\ude31\ud83d\ude31\ud83d\ude31"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""1st,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""7:47"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter4"": {""username"": ""Erik w/ UniqueModernArt.com"", ""post"": ""Bu-cky Bu-cky Bu-cky!"", ""post_time"": [""Erik"", ""w/"", ""UniqueModernArt.com""]}, ""commenter5"": {""username"": ""Tee in NC"", ""post"": ""Way to find a way defense.

Atlanta lost 17-13 and their record dropped to 6-6. The Bucs are 5-6 as they kick off minutes from now in Charlotte. No excuses, Bucs.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/betting-the-bucs-week-13-edition/|Betting The Bucs (Week 13 Edition)|Joe’s got a documented 9-8 season record in this space after last week‘s picks. No more brown bag over Joe’s head in the Winn-Dixie frozen food aisle. “Betting the Bucs” reveals where Joe is throwing cash within today’s Buccaneers game against the Panthers. Of course, it’s only Joe’s pregame picks, not in-game wagers, like when Joe struck more gold betting on the Bucs -9 points immediately following their opening-drive touchdown against the Giants last Sunday. (Sports betting is legal in Florida but there’s only one government-regulated Florida sportsbook monopoly run by the Seminole tribe. That’s where Joe gets the betting lines.) Good luck!  Mike Evans Over 5.5 catches (+140) — Any wager tied to extending Mike Evans’ streak of 10 consecutive seasons of 1,000 yards receiving has Joe’s attention. Evans, now healthy, seems destined to get 9 or 10 targets today. So Joe likes the odds of him catching 6 balls. Evans had 5 catches on 6 targets last Sunday while only playing 60 percent of the Bucs’ snaps. A $20 bet here returns $48.  Buccaneers -7 (+110): The official game line is Bucs -6, -115, but Joe’s giving the extra point to get a better payout. Yeah, Joe feels that strongly about this game, and it was a subject late in the recent Ira Kaufman Podcast. Simply put: The Panthers’ only real strength is an average offensive line. Plus, Joe believes Carolina’s post-bye home loss to the Chiefs was sort of their Super Bowl. They’re primed for a letdown emotionally and because they played over their heads against Kansas City, which is reflected in the betting line. Carolina allowes 30.2 points per game, and Joe fully expects the Bucs to get there.    YaYa Diaby Over 0.5 sacks (+145) — Inside the halls of One Buc Palace, team officials believe Diaby is on the verge of a breakout based on film and practice, but also because of the strong play lately of Vita Vea and Calijah Kancey. However, Joe especially likes this wager because Diaby is likely to get extra work today with fellow edge rusher Joe Tryon-Shoyinka missing the first game of his career. Also, as evidenced above, Joe believes the Panthers will be playing from behind, and in desperation mode for a chunk of the game. It’s a “sacks” wager, so Joe’s not going crazy here.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/bucky-irving-gets-a-christian-mccaffrey-comparison/|Bucky Irving Gets A Christian McCaffrey Comparison|So a former All-Pro linebacker, a guy who spent years hating the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, is a huge Bucky Irving fan. Ex-Panthers LB Thomas Davis (2005-2018) nowadays treats fans to some Xs and Os work for the Panthers’ official website. Examining today’s Bucs-Panthers matchup, Davis had Joe putting down the Egg McMuffins at JoeBucsFan.com world headquarters and hitting the rewind button. Davis compared Bucky Irving to his 2017 teammate Christian McCaffrey. He added that Irving sometimes makes NFL defensive players look like high schoolers. “This kid has emerged as one of the most elite backs in the NFL and kind of reminds me of Christian McCaffrey with the ball in his hands — breaking tackles, smaller in stature but big in heart,” Davis said. Joe thinks that’s a hell of a comparison from a former defensive player that is no hot take artist. Davis said Panthers defensive players must have true commitment to tackling when they see Irving step between the White lines.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/testing-running-backs-eyes/|Testing Running Backs’ Eyes|Panthers head coach Dave Canales, last year’s Bucs offensive coordinator, gave some cool insight into the Todd Bowles defense on Friday. Canales, of course, knows all things Bowles very well. And he sounded like a playcaller who is expecting his young quarterback, Bryce Young, to take a barrage of blitzes today when the Bucs-Panthers game kicks off at 4 o’clock. Frankly, if Bowles doesn’t blitz Young a lot — considering he’s got his starting cornerbacks back on the field healthy — then Joe might have a complete meltdown. Canales said Bowles is a masterful disruptor. “A coordinator that’s not just going to let you sit back there and run your normal plays. He’s going to challenge all your protections. He’s going to challenge your concepts — all the different things that require the eyes of the running back,” Canales told his team’s’ website. ” … Different types of coverage styles, so that your receivers aren’t just attacking the same coverages the same way. And he’s doing it for so long. You know, he’s got a real knack for when to call what.” Joe sees Young as a quarterback who occasionally makes some A+ reads and touch throws, but he’s definitely inconsistent and he only scrambles about three times a game. If the Bucs defense plays like an average NFL defense today, the Panthers should be in for a long afternoon.|2024-12-01 08:48:00|230|8|5|Dave Canales|Insights on Bowles defense vs. Young-led Panthers.|7|Mix of optimism and aggression in fan comments ahead of crucial game for the Bucs.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Kenton Smith"", ""post"": ""I\u2019m hoping our defense can wipe that dorky smile off his clueless face here in about 7 hours or so!

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/zyon-mccollum-let-baker-mayfield-be-baker-mayfield/|Zyon McCollum: Let Baker Mayfield Be Baker Mayfield|Joe knows some Bucs fans cringe when they see Baker Mayfield running 40-50 yards downfield to throw a block or trying to truck a linebacker. And Joe guesses if some Bucs coaches were given truth serum, they may not like it either. But Bucs cornerback Zyon McCollum has a hunch if coaches don’t let Mayfield be himself, he may become a lesser quarterback. Joe was talking to McCollum last week and asked him despite how Mayfield’s hustle stokes his teammates, was there a part of McCollum that whispers to himself, “Get down, Baker.” That has never crossed his mind. “Honestly, no,” McCollum said about thinking Mayfield needs to get down or be a little less aggressive. “That never went through my head. “The type of player Baker is, he plays the game the way it is meant to be played and good things happen. And when I see a quarterback doing that, playing the game the way it is meant to be played, hard-nosed like that, I’m not worried about him being hurt or injured because he is in the flow of the game.” This reminded Joe of the old football saying; if you play not to get hurt, that’s when a player gets hurt. Besides, McCollum said, Mayfield’s hustle energizes teammates. “It gets us all on our feet,” McCollum said. “He had me jumping around [blocking 40-50 yards downfield for Bucky Irving against the Giants]. It invigorates me. It fills me up with energy. That type of play is crazy, from a quarterback?” McCollum recounted how he saw that play develop with Irving nearly breaking a 90-yard run and Mayfield waving Irving to follow him to freedom at midfield. “All I saw was Bucky running and then out of nowhere, I see Mayfield,” McCollum recounted. “I’m like, ‘Dang.’ “When you see a guy who cares like that, it’s like, ‘OK, I’ve got no excuses.'” Sometimes a team needs a spark like Mayfield to ignite them. Joe guesses it’s best to let a player be himself.|2024-12-01 02:00:00|336|22|8|Zyon McCollum|McCollum supports Mayfield's aggressive playing style.|9|Mixed sentiment towards Baker Mayfield with appreciation, criticism, and uncertainty expressed by commenters.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Badbucs"", ""post"": ""Baker is a football player not just a qb.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/graham-barton-explains-rise-of-the-offensive-line/|Graham Barton Explains Rise Of The Offensive Line|While the Bucs have a losing record and will have to scratch and claw their way to a potential playoff berth, one thing about the Bucs has been a joy to watch. That’s how the offensive line may now be the strength of the team. Oh, sure, the Bucs have a good run game, and that’s in part due to the line developing so well. Naturally, Joe would have mentioned receivers but now the Bucs really only have one tried and true receiver, Mike Evans, and even he isn’t quite 100 percent (depending who you listen to). So yeah, the offensive line has really developed and you could say they are a top-10 unit or better when healthy. Joe asked rookie center Graham Barton why the line has evolved into a tough force. “Liam,” Barton said of Bucs offensive coordinator Liam Coen. “He puts us in a good position to be successful. The way he mixes in play-action pass, and the way we run the ball and then quick throws. “So when we do need to push the ball down the field we can do that because we showed the defensive line multiple looks. It kind of gives them a second to hesitate. “It’s a testament to, one, him.” And like Billy Mays would say, “But wait, there’s more!” “And two, the work we put in as a unit,” Barton added. “The countless hours and tons and tons of reps. We sort of gelled as the season has gone on.” And that, in turn, has really sprung the run game. Barton insisted he could be playing better and the line has room to improve. “I hope Sunday was a game we can build on,” Barton said about curb-stomping the Giants last week. “I think we left some things out there at the end of the game that we can clean up on.” Barton added all of his offensive line teammates are hungry for improvement. “Continue to work and never being satisfied, that is sort of a key,” Barton said of the offensive line’s goal. “Always looking to improve.” Joe sees the Bucs’ offensive line as the best it’s been since 2021, and maybe the best since the Super Bowl season of 2020.|2024-12-01 00:35:00|372|19|8|Graham Barton|Bucs' offensive line strength and improvement under Liam Coen.|8|Mostly positive comments about team performance and potential.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/kancey/|Calijah Kancey Discusses Sacks|The interior defensive line is the element of the Bucs defense that has allowed the team to stay in games. In three of the last four games, the Bucs have lost by one score. In two of the three, the Bucs lost on the final drive. Yeah, last week the Bucs destroyed the Giants but previously, the Bucs had lost four straight entering the bye week with the final three one-score losses. Still, beginning with the 31-26 loss to the Dixie Chicks, Bucs defensive tackles Vita Vea and Calijah Kancey have been on fire. In the last three games (losses to Kansas City and San Francisco and a win over New York) Kancey has four sacks. Vea in those same games has three sacks. That’s seven combined in the last three games. Compare that to the Bucs’ starting outside linebackers, you know, the edge rushers? The only thing those guys are rushing is the buffet in the team cafeteria. Joe Tryon-Shoyinka and YaYa Diaby have a combined four sacks all year. In just the past three games, Kancey and Vita have damn near doubled that mark. Joe last week asked Kancey why everything was clicking for him and Vea. Is it that Kancey turned the corner recently and, because of his calf injury in training camp, he is just now 100 percent? Do Kancey and Vita finally have a strong working relationship and play off each other? Kancey told Joe that is too simplified. “Really, it’s just the consistency and doing all the little things so we can continue to perform at a high level,” Kancey said. Fair enough. In today’s “Gameday Tampa Bay” game preview. Joe noted the Bucs could be down three outside linebackers today. JTS didn’t make the trip to Charlotte yesterday, so he is out. So too is Markees Watts (who?). And Anthony Nelson did not practice Friday as he is dealing with an unspecified personal issue. He is listed as questionable for today. So the Bucs, in theory, could be down three outside linebackers. Joe thought that was bad. Then Joe got to thinking, the Bucs don’t get production from outside linebackers/edge rush as it is. So what if JTS, Watts and Nelson may all be out today? After all, zero minus zero still equals zero. Where would the Bucs even be without Kancey and Vea?|2024-12-01 00:10:00|391|10|5|Calijah Kancey|Bucs' interior defensive line key to recent success.|5|Mixed sentiments on team performance and potential strategies, some optimism for playoffs despite setbacks.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Alexandre Nascimento"", ""post"": ""So now we can assume Jose Ramirez will be activate?"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""1st,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""12:29"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Lou."", ""post"": ""This is the time to deploy the dime, to drop a safety into a rover position, or to generally re-imagine the defense.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/gameday-tampa-bay-313/|Gameday Tampa Bay|Game 12 Bucs (5-6) at Stinking Panthers (3-8) Kickoff: 4:05 p.m. TV: FOX (WTVT-TV Channel 13, locally) with Chris Myers, Mark Schlereth and Jen Hale.  Streaming: NFL+ (Geographic restrictions apply; subscription may be required). Radio: Buccaneers Radio Network WXTB-FM 97.9 in the Tampa-St. Petersburg region (Transmisiones de radio en español en WTMP-FM 96.1 y WMGG-AM 1470 en Tampa). Additional stations throughout Florida on the Buccaneers Radio Network can be found here. The game also will be broadcast on SiriusXM Channel 381 (Buccaneers Radio Network feed). Weather: Not bad for the first day of December with temperatures in the lower 50s. Tailgaters will have to have a coat unless they are near the grill. By kickoff, look for it to be 54 degrees, per AccuWeather.com. The temperature will drop pretty quickly once the sun sets and should be 45 by the end of the game. No precipitation is expected with sunny skies clear day, albeit a little breezy. Odds: Per Hard Rock Bet, as of midnight, Bucs -6 (-275); over/under 46.5. Referees: Tra Blake and his gang are flat out homers, per Sharp Football Analysis. In his career, home teams in games called by Blake and his outfit are 18-13. It’s much worse in games played by division rivals. In divisional games, Blake and his posse see to it that the home team is 7-1. Injuries: Bucs — Out: Tykee Smith (knee), OLB Joe Tryon-Shoyinka (ankle), OLB Markees Watts (knee), S Jordan Whitehead (pec). Questionable: CB Troy Hill (ankle/foot), OLB Anthony Nelson (personal), LT Tristan Wirfs (knee/ankle). Stinking Panthers — Out: WR Jalen Coker (quadriceps). TE Ja’Tavlon Sanders (neck). Questionable: OLB Amare Barno (knee), OLB Jadeveon Clowney (knee), CB Caleb Farley (shoulder), S Nick Scott (hamstring). Outlook: The Stinking Panthers have a garbage defense. As a Bucs fan who lives in the Carolinas Twittered Joe, “Mike Smith bad.” They can’t stop the run and struggle with the pass. Tight ends eat them up. There is just no way the Bucs should lose this game if they are serious about making a run for the playoffs. Now the Bucs may be vulnerable on defense. The Bucs are down possibly three outside linebackers Joe Tryon-Shoyinka, Markees Watts (wh0?) and maybe Anthony Nelson, who was on the injury report as questionable and did not practice Friday with an unspecified personal matter. But, it’s not like the Bucs get any pass rush production from their outside linebackers anyway. So, you know, zero minus zero is still zero. It sure helps that Vita Vea and Calijah Kancey have been on an absolute tear. If the Bucs just keep hammering the Stinking Panthers on the ground, this shouldn’t be a contest. If the Bucs lose this game, they have no business talking playoffs. Fun facts: It looks as if Bucs QB Baker Mayfield may set a career mark today. He needs 201 pass yards for 6th-career 3,000-yard season. In three of his past four road games Mayfield had had at least two touchdown passes. … With a touchdown today it will give RB Rachaad White six games in a row with a touchdown. White often has decent games against the Stinking Panthers. In his last two games against Carolina, White has at least 90 yards from scrimmage. … WR Mike Evans needs to average 100 yards a game the rest of the way to break 1,000 yards receiving and keep his career-long streak alive. … DT Vita Vea currently has a four-game road streak of a sack each game. … DT Calijah Kancey has a three-game streak of a sack. He has five sacks this season. … Stinking Panthers QB Bryce Young is coming off a season-high 263 yards passing game in a loss to the Chiefs. He has thrown a touchdown in five straight games and has not thrown an interception in his last two games. … RB Chubba Hubbard has 1,002 scrimmage yards, his second-straight season with 1,000 scrimmage yards. … LB D.J. Wonnum has a sack in his last two games. … CB Jaycee Horn had a career-high 10 passes defensed this season. |2024-12-01 00:00:00|679|10|4|Gameday Tampa Bay|Buccaneers favored against struggling Panthers|3|Mixed sentiment, leaning slightly towards optimism.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""adam from ny"", ""post"": ""for some reason i like listening to that wacky guy schlereth\u2026"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""1st,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""5:28"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""adam from ny"", ""post"": ""and jen inhale\u2026\u2026\u2026.need i say more   \ud83d\ude42"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""1st,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""5:28"", ""am""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""TampabayDJ"", ""post"": ""Bucs win 35-13"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""1st,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""6:03"", ""am""]}, ""commenter3"": {""username"": ""heyjude"", ""post"": ""Loving the Bucs Fun Facts!
