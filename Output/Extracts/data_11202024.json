Joe has no doubt that the Barber brothers will be talking plenty behind the scenes.Of course, all the chatter in New York is about the Giants (2-8) just benching franchise quarterback Daniel Jones in favor of third-stringer, fan-favorite Tommy DeVito. But it’s equally about the Giants needing to tank for draft position.Tiki Barber said Monday that he would be studying Tuesday’s news conference of Giants head coach Brian Daboll to see if the Giants are sincere about having DeVito be successful.“It’s the next media availability that I’m very interested in,” Barbers said before Tuesday’s news conference.“Like I’m really interested to see what the reaction is. Because if it’s like ‘eh, whatever,’ I don’t know if Tommy’s going to be successful. If it’s like they love Tommy, he’s been grinding here as the scout team quarterback. We love what he brings and we’re excited for him and we’re going to rally around them,’ then he has a chance. Not to be the starting quarterback in 2025 [and] beyond, but just to be successful.”Well, Joe heard that take from Tiki Barber on Monday and listened to the Daboll news conference yesterday. There was no excitement from the head coach raving about how DeVito has been killing it on the scout team, or barking that DeVito is a winner that will energize the team.Assuming Tiki has the pulse of the team, Joe’s conclusion was the Giants are not doing their best to win games.

Quarterback Baker Mayfield has improved upon a career year in 2023. The revamped offensive line is solid if not strong and seemingly improving by the week. The Bucs rank No. 3 in explosive plays.What’s there to quibble about?In an ESPN feature focused on the performance of offensive coordinators this year, reporter Jenna Laine had to do some stretching to find a Coen negative. And it really has nothing to do with Coen at all.Injuries.… … The Bucs lost 50% of their scoring offense when wide receivers Mike Evans and Chris Godwin went down because of injuries, with Godwin out for the season. Mayfield is still performing at a high level but not having the threat of a downfield passing attack has hurt their chances.Yet even after Evans and Godwin went down, for the first two games after their injuries, Coen still got production. It only seemed in the last game, the loss to the 49ers, the loss of Evans and Godwin finally caught up with Coen.Joe can think of two potential negatives for Coen, and one is nitpicking.First, what has happened to Jalen McMillan and Trey Palmer? McMillan is nowhere close to the same receiver who was balling out in practice and training camp. Palmer? His numbers are way down.The second potential drawback for Coen is the final drive in the loss to the 49ers where the Bucs had to kick a field goal to tie the game (which the defense naturally shat the bed and couldn’t hold), Coen didn’t have arguably his best available offensive player on the field, Bucky Irving.It’s players, not plays. So Joe gets why the Bucs wanted Rachaad White on the field. He’s a better blocker and receiver. But he stinks running between the tackles, which is exactly what Coen called for — with all-too-predictable results.Other than those items, Coen has done such a solid job with the offense, “this Joe” believes Coen will be a head coach somewhere in 2025.", "post_time": "2024-11-20T13:00:33+00:00", "word_count": 366, "number_of_comments": 32, "article_sentiment_score": "8", "article_subject": "Liam Coen", "article_summary": "Coen excels as Bucs' offensive coordinator despite minor setbacks.", "responses": {"commenter0": {"username": "Nutterbuccer", "post": "Yes head coach right here in Tampa no way the bucs keep Bowles after the season.

Sound familiar?Well, Joe read  stats yesterday from data scientist (highfalutin title for “statgeek”) Sam Hoppen, currently of FantasyPros and soon to be for BSPN Bet. He listed the explosive play rate for NFL defenses.(There are various definitions of explosive plays, depending on who is doing the numbercrunching. Hoppen defines explosive plays as pass or run plays of 15 yards or more.)When it comes to the Bucs, it’s gross. It seems 11 percent of opposing offenses’ plays against the Bucs defense go for 15 yards or more. That puts the Bucs’ defense at No. 25 for explosive play rate.The worst is the Browns who allow 12.5 percent of opponents’ plays to go for at least 15 yards.With the Bucs, it really doesn’t matter if it is the run or the pass. Some 2.5 percent of runs against the Bucs defense go for 15 yards or more. That’s No. 23 in the league — depressing considering how much Bucs head coach Todd Bowles stresses stopping the run.Pass defense? Hoppen has the Bucs ranked No. 24 with 8.7 percent of pass plays going for at least 15 yards.This may not be as bad as The Smiths (Lovie and Mike).

This thing he is doing for Baker Mayfield, Dude he already has done it for Will Levis and turned him into a NFL QB.
