Well, today offensive coordinator Liam Coen called Mayfield “the modern day Brett Favre.” Sorry, Coach. Joe can’t go that far. At Mayfield’s age, Favre was a three-time league MVP and a Super Bowl champ. But Joe gets it. Favre and Mayfield had similar styles and played the position with a similar mentality and love of the game. And Mayfield has posted extraordinary numbers the past two seasons. A less biased view of Mayfield’s play came this week from Matt Ryan, the former Falcons star QB. After 15 seasons with the Falcons and Colts, Ryan now works for CBS and was asked to rank the NFC playoff quarterbacks. He put Mayfield at No. 3 after Jared Goff and Matt Stafford. Ryan lauded Mayfield for his overall performance this season, as well as for intangibles like being “gutsy” and “competitive.” After Mayfield, Ryan had (in order) Sam Darnold, Jalen Hurts, Jayden Daniels and Jordan Love. Joe likes the ranking of Mayfield at No. 3. It’s still a quarterback-driven league and the Bucs with Mayfield are in excellent position again to win a playoff game or two (or three?).

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/concern/|Concern|Joe doesn’t know at this point if anyone can point to the Bucs’ 2024 schedule and say, “The Bucs beat/lost to that team, therefore in the playoffs the Bucs will… “ In a playoff preview article typed by the ESPN team of NFL beat writers, Jenna Laine offered a reason for concern for the Bucs. Reason for concern: The defense has struggled with health and consistency. It has rarely had a healthy squad this season, especially in the secondary. While the Buccaneers have given up only 17.0 points per game since their Week 11 bye — second best in the league — only one of those opponents had a winning record. Over the course of the season, Tampa Bay has allowed 249.3 passing yards per game, the fourth most in the league. Joe is right there with Laine about the team’s inconsistency. Have a really good game and/or beat a good team one week, shat the bed the next. That began with Detroit and continued through last Sunday’s game when the Bucs had to fight like mad to beat the slimy Saints. (Yes, the Bucs beat the Commandos in Week 1 and then beat the Lions the following week. Did anyone, in mid-September, believe the Commandos were a “good” team? No. They molded into one as the season progressed, sure.) Joe can’t point to the “only played one team with a winning record since the bye” angle. Why? That one team with a winning record is also a playoff team. And the Bucs stomped out the Chargers in their own crib. The Bucs have proven they can beat good teams (Detroit, Philadelphia, Los Angeles) and hang with good teams (lost in overtime to the Chiefs). The problem is, the following week, the Bucs vomit on their feet. In Joe’s mind, next week’s division round game is the one to sweat about.|2025-01-07 16:28:00|311|53|5|Joe|Bucs face inconsistency concerns heading into playoffs.|5|Mixed feelings on team performance and coaching, uncertainty about future success and leadership.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""#99 the big fella"", ""post"": ""Buccaneers will win this game Joe!

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/jon-gruden-bucs-will-beat-commanders/|Jon Gruden: Bucs Will Beat Commanders|It’s on to the divisional round of the playoffs! That’s the word from the Bucs’ first Super Bowl head coach. Tampa-resident and booted Buccaneers Ring of Honor member Jon Gruden (expected back in the Ring soon) is a Barstool Sports analyst these days. Chucky still has players he loves but rarely if ever mentions a player he doesn’t love. What kind of analysis is that? Anyway, one guy Chucky really loves is the Bucs’ quarterback. And it sounds like true love. “Tampa Bay, they’re dangerous. They’re going to win this first-round game against Washington, you watch,” Gruden said on a Barstool Sports show last night. “Baker Mayfield is a great quarterback, man. He’s a great player. I love Baker Mayfield, man. Even my wife loves Baker Mayfield. We got Mayfield jerseys. We even made Christmas cookies with Mayfield’s number on there.” So there you go. The Bucs will win Sunday and face either the Eagles on the road or the Rams-Vikings winner at home a week later. However, Joe must admit that Gruden has proven he’s not the next great Swami when it comes to game picks. Perhaps that’s why the Gruden “Shred Line” is so popular.|2025-01-07 13:46:00|197|43|8|Jon Gruden|Former Bucs coach predicts playoff win for Tampa Bay.|6|Mixed sentiments with some optimism and skepticism towards the team's performance and predictions.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Pops Malone"", ""post"": ""Right on chuckwagon!!!

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/report-jaguars-ask-to-interview-liam-coen-will-he-accept/|Report: Jaguars Ask To Interview Liam Coen; Will He Accept?|So NFL Network reports the Jaguars formally requested to interview Bucs offensive coordinator Liam Coen for their open head coach position. There is no report regarding whether Coen turned down the opportunity, or will turn it down. Per NFL rules, Coen wouldn’t be eligible to interview until next week. Last week, Coen played negotiator at his weekly news conference. He artfully danced on both sides of the fence, talking about how happy he is in Tampa and how he’s in no rush to be a head coach. But Coen also said he wants to be a head coach and didn’t try to say he needs more seasoning for the job. It felt like Coen’s agent (assuming he has one) was smiling and nodding in agreement while watching on YouTube and sipping a congnac. As Joe has written previously, Joe hopes Team Glazer finds and meets whatever Coen’s price is to not interview for a head coaching gig this year.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/distracted-bucs/|Distracted Bucs|Is it logical to believe the Bucs were distracted Sunday against the Saints, overly consumed with Mike Evans getting his 11th consecutive season of 1,000 or more yards? Joe thinks the Bucs were distracted. Significantly. First, Evans seemed overly focused on his record. Go watch Evans’ reaction to Jalen McMillan’s Week 17 touchdown in the fourth quarter against the Panthers. And then go watch him in the seconds after McMillan’s game-winning TD on Sunday. Both times you’ll see a player who doesn’t look happy, and one that is not celebrating with his teammate. Joe loves Evans as much as any fan, but Joe has to call it straight. It sure seemed like the streak was weighing Evans down. Todd Bowles gave SiriusXM NFL Radio insight yesterday into how important the streak was to the club. “I think the team and the coaches were more excited than Mike was,” Bowles said. “In the locker room, there was so much emotion.” Joe admits to fishing for reasons why the Bucs came out terribly flat against the woeful Saints, trailing 16-6 at halftime. There was no good reason for that, so Joe keeps coming back to the streak. Defensive players as well as offensive guys told Joe after the game that the Evans streak was a constant on their minds throughout the game. That’s highly abnormal. Joe’s glad the streak-freak is over. Hopefully, all involved learned a valuable lesson or two for next year’s 1,000-yard chase.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/motivated-vita-vea/|“Motivated” Vita Vea|Joe’s antennae always come alive when a player talks about another player’s motivation. The “E” word, effort, can be a dangerous subject. Effort is not a question or concern on the Buccaneers, if you ask Todd Bowles. He’s been saying that for months. Fans have seen the Bucs defense look awful in the first halves of games. Retired Bucs tight end Cameron Brate (2014-2022) thinks that’s more a function of playcallling, he told the Buccaneers Radio Network yesterday. “The past few games, first half, we seemed a little bit conservative with our defensive playcalling,” Brate said, adding that offenses are often heavily scripted earlier in games, which can play a role. “Gotta find a way to [play more effective defense] in the first half.” Then Brate, without being asked, lauded Vita Vea for his performance Sunday against the slimy Saints. “Vita was truly unblockable the entire game. And when he’s healthy, motivated, you know, and playing well, like it’s a totally different defense,” Brate said. “I would say the back half the season we’ve really seen that and the impact it’s had on the defense.” The “motivated” line really stuck with Joe. “Motivated?” Would Brate use that word talking about other Bucs captains like Lavonte David or Mike Evans. Interesting choice. Joe’s not blasting Vea, but that comment was hard to ignore. Pro Bowler Vea finished this season with a career high seven sacks, and career highs in tackles for loss (10) and quarterback hits (13). Tom Brady was raving about his constant push in the trenches on Sunday. Joe’s desperate for Vea to have a big game Sunday night against the Commanders. Joe believes the Bucs’ best shot to win is for their defensive stars to make a few standout plays each. If that happens, it should provide just enough room for the Bucs offense to win the game.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/todd-bowles-rachaad-white-will-get-more-touches/|Todd Bowles: Rachaad White Will Get More Touches|Since the Bucs curb-stomped the Chargers in Los Angeles, Bucs running back Rachaad White’s touches have dropped each week. And that brings Joe to Sunday’s division-clinching win over the slimy Saints. White logged 18 snaps on offense. He didn’t touch the ball once. Look, the Bucs, especially after the Dallas debacle, had their backs to the wall. And there is no doubt who the team’s best running back is, Bucky Irving. Even Bucs offensive coordinator Liam Coen said he was going to get Irving more snaps. He almost had to. The Bucs had no room to hold back their best players. Yesterday, either Bucs head coach Todd Bowles was having the back of White, or Bowles really does want White to touch the ball more, which means less touches for one of the NFL’s most dynamic backs. “We have to get him more touches,” Bowles said of White. “The kind of way the game went in the first half, I thought the defense stayed on the field too long, didn’t give them many opportunities. “The second half, I think we were trying to press some things, we backed up and made some plays in the passing game, but we have to get him more touches for sure.” Why? Irving is the guy getting the job done. It’s the playoffs. Guys who earned touches should get them. Irving has earned them. Joe did find it a little weird that Sean Tucker had two carries for 16 (!) yards yet White didn’t touch the ball. Joe believes that White had turned into a decent fullback type. Yeah, you read right: Fullback. He’s developed an ability to get a couple of tough yards between the tackles. That happened last year in a key game at Atlanta as well. Joe is not anti-White, just more pro-Bucky. The Bucs should not be taking touches from one of the NFL’s most dangerous players. This is the playoffs. It is win-or-Cancun. It’s not worthless preseason football.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/ex-bucs-gm-talks-sunday-stunner/|Ex-Bucs GM Talks Sunday Stunner|Did the Bucs really just need a fourth-quarter comeback to beat the slimy Saints after trailing 16-6 at halftime? Keep calm. The Commanders, the Bucs’ playoffs opponent, blew a 17-point lead on the Saints and were a two-point conversion from losing to them three weeks ago. Still, the Bucs sad early showing Sunday in a must-win game against tanking New Orleans was troublesome. Even former Bucs rock star general manager Mark Dominik admitted to being concerned and surprised. Dominik, who doesn’t hide rooting for the Bucs, co-hosted on SiriusXM NFL Radio last night. “You know, on Sunday I’m sitting there watching the Bucs, it’s the third quarter and I’m like, ‘Gosh, they might be out of the postseason. They might be done. What’s going on?'” Dominik shared. “Spencer Rattler’s playing like a man possessed and, you know, Baker Mayfield makes dynamic throws. You know, the Buccaneers, five straight years in the postseason, Jason Licht’s done a great job with that football team, really put them in position.” Dominik went on to praise Todd Bowles and share his disbelief that Bowles has so many doubters. Dominik noted that so many other teams have underachieved when the Bucs have not. “It’s ludicrous that people were talking about Todd Bowles being fired, even last week,” Dominik said. As for Sunday night’s Bucs-Commanders matchup, Dominik called it the “feel-good story” of Sunday’s three-game playoff slate but didn’t offer a winner.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/thats-good-karma/|“That’s Good Karma”|Joe already thought of this but it sparked another element that could pay off for the Bucs come free agency. Yesterday a lot of the hollering shows on TV picked up on Mike Evans’ extending his streak of 1,000-yard receiving seasons. Equally important, per ex-players Darius Butler and Pat McAfee, players noticed that too. Most know that Bucs coach Todd Bowles gave offensive coordinator Liam Coen and Baker Mayfield the green light Sunday to throw to Mike Evans so he could reach the 1,000-yard receiving plateau, even though the Bucs led by 8 points and could take a knee to win the division and go to the playoffs. At the time of that play, the Stinking Panthers and Dixie Chicks had gone to overtime so no one on the field knew Atlanta would lose. Evans not only extended the streak, but his catch pocketed him $3 million in bonuses as a result. That, Butler said, was why players across the league took notice. McAfee praised the Bucs for doing something for a loyal player, even if maybe the Bucs should have just taken a knee. “That could have been a pick-six,” McAfee said on his ESPN show. “But, nah, we’re going to stick up for our guy. We’re going to let our guy get his numbers. … “That’s good karma,” McAfee said. “That’s doing the right thing for your player who has done all the right things for your city, for your team, for your community.” Players across the NFL notice that stuff. Word travels. Maybe Bowles remembers what it was like when he played? More important, when Bowles played, money wasn’t handed out like it is now. So bonuses were a bigger deal. Maybe that was on Bowles’ mind? Butler noted that players are very aware of this type of gesture. There is angst at The Star, Cowboys headquarters, because Cowboys players were miffed that quarterback Cooper Rush did not start on Sunday. By Jerry Jones approving of the Rush’s benching (you cannot tell Joe that Jones has no say about when a Cowboys quarterback is benched), Jones avoided a $250,000 bonus to Rush. So that got Joe thinking that when free agency comes in two months (yup, March 12) and the Bucs are trying to lure a player or two to Tampa, they’ll see how some owners dodge paying guys and then notice how Bowles goes out of his way to make sure his players get paid. That should help recruiting.|2025-01-07 07:00:00|413|24|8|Mike Evans|Players appreciate Buccaneers' gesture towards Evans for bonuses.|9|Positive reactions to Bowles' decision to help Mike Evans set records and earn bonuses.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""KABucs"", ""post"": ""Maybe we can attract a good edge rusher to sign here with the way the Bucs do things + weather + no state tax.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/this-guy-is-just-changing-lanes-on-the-autobahn/|“This Guy Is Just Changing Lanes On The Autobahn”|Former NFL offensive lineman Brian Baldinger is a big fan of what Bucs offensive coordinator Liam Coen did turning the league’s worst rushing offense into a top-five rushing offense. And while Baldinger raves about rookie Bucky Irving (“This guy is just changing lanes on the Autobahn.”), Baldinger noted it takes a team to build an offense. Of course, Irving has been a catalyst. Baldinger also loves how Coen schemes the offense and has a diverse blocking plan, Baldinger even gave a shoutout to running back Sean Tucker who he said, “came out of nowhere.” He sort of did since he did little to nothing during his rookie season. Joe loves Bucky’s ability to make guys miss. And Joe finds it a welcome change to watch a running back make his own holes when the holes aren’t there — and they aren’t always there. He’s making all kinds of people miss. Food for thought: The Commandos have the league’s third-worst rushing defense, allowing 137.5 yards a game. And the Bucs run game has been on fire for the most part since the bye. Joe likes that matchup.  |2025-01-07 03:45:00|186|25|8|Bucky Irving|Baldinger praises Bucs run game improvements|3|Views are mixed with some optimism about specific players but frustration with team performance.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""BUC N A"", ""post"": ""It\u2019s in our hands."", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""7th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""4:08"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Keydoc"", ""post"": ""Do you think that perhaps Liam kept things rather pedestrian with the play calling against the Saints?

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/liam-coen-baker-mayfield-and-short-passing/|Liam Coen, Baker Mayfield And Short Passing|Last week in his weekly press conference, Bucs offensive coordinator Liam Coen needled (?) Joe for focusing so much on how the long pass is pretty much a thing of the past. Coen either had the impression that Joe was calling him out for this or felt slighted in some way. Joe is sorry if it was taken that way. That certainly was not Joe’s intent. Was only pointing out in Baker Mayfield’s passing charts how the long pass is rarely used. Nothing more. (Shoot, Joe has typed for months he believes Coen will be a head coach somewhere in 2025. He’s that good. And Joe also pointed out several times that only a first-class a-hole would nitpick one of the better offenses in the league. You know, if it’s working — and it surely is — that’s the best you can ask for. That’s what one wants.) Coen went into detail last week why he throws shorter passes to, for example, Mike Evans. Coen of course wants to get the ball into Evans’ hands. So why take a bunch of low-percentage shots when you can call shorter routes which have a higher percentage of getting caught and let Evans’ wheels take over from there? Makes sense. However, before Coen needled (?) Joe, Joe wondered if one reason for the short passing (guessing “dink and dunk” didn’t go over well at One Buc Palace), by Coen was if he believed that was more in Mayfield’s wheelhouse. It seems a stat guy has some statistics that suggest that could be a factor. It seems Mayfield has been damn accurate in short passes. The passes charted below (if the chart doesn’t show, click here) show Mayfield’s overall completion percentage from the line of scrimmage to 9 yards, 10-19 yards and 20 yards and beyond. There is also a category for “highly accurate completions.” The only spot where Mayfield is a little shaky is a highly accurate completion percentage over 20 yards. Maybe, it is a combination of the two? Regardless, Coen’s explanation about short passes makes sense to Joe. But it also seems Mayfield is taking advantage of that philosophy.  |2025-01-07 00:00:00|358|34|7|Liam Coen|Coen explains strategy behind utilizing short passes effectively for Mayfield.|5|Mixed feelings about the team's performance and coaching, with some optimism and criticism present.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Andy"", ""post"": ""their is something about this team i just love."", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""7th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""12:11"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""GoneGator"", ""post"": ""I wonder what it would look like since the bye?
