https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/the-bucs-preston-smith/|The Bucs & Preston Smith|An established edge rusher just hit the street. That means chaos erupted in the beer-stained conference room at JoeBucsFan.com world headquarters. The interns are chilling beer and trying to keep Joe from hyperventilating. Today the Steelers cut veteran outside linebacker Preston Smith. The former Packers stud turns 33 in November and he’s coming off an interesting 4 1/2-sack season. Pittsburgh traded for Smith at last year’s November trade deadline, but by year’s end, Smith was on the bench behind dudes who recovered from injuries. He was inactive in Week 17 and for the playoffs. Smiths’ claim to fame in his 10-year career? In addition to 70 1/2 sacks (plus 4 1/2 in the postseason), Smith has never missed a game with an injury. Joe sees Steelers fans on social media a little perplexed by the cost-cutting move. He was going to hit the Steelers salary cap next season for more than $13 million. Joe is in favor of any edge rusher like Smith that appears more lethal than Bucs outside linebackers like Markees Watts, José Ramirez, Joe Tryon-Shoyinka and Anthony Nelson.|2025-02-14 19:19:00|181|34|2|Preston Smith|Steelers cut veteran outside linebacker Preston Smith|2|Mixed opinions on signing Preston Smith, leaning more towards skepticism and preference for youth.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""FortMyersDave"", ""post"": ""Like Joe, I am positive that Preston Smith would be an upgrade over JTS or any of the other OLBs which Joe mentioned above but at 33 he would simply be a band-aid and the Bucs will be back to square one in a season or so even if he contributes positively.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/sean-murphy-bunting-talks-secret-sauce/|Sean Murphy-Bunting Talks “Secret Sauce”|The legend of Buccaneers Ring of Honor general manager Jason Licht takes many forms. The 2025 free agency siren goes off in 24 days and former Bucs cornerback Carlton Davis, a Bucs Super Bowl champ and a Licht 2018 second-round draft pick, is going to get a fat new contract somehwere. Lots of former Licht draft picks are making money around the league. Another Bucs Super Bowl-winning corner drafted in 2019, Sean Murphy-Bunting, is entering Year 2 of his fancy three-year deal with the Cardinals. He’s well-liked in Arizona, where he had a strong second half of last season that included three interceptions and two forced fumbles. Late last year, Murphy-Bunting was asked by Cardinals team media to talk about the “secret sauce” that makes a Super Bowl winner. It’s an obsession in Arizona, where they’ve never brought home Lombardi trophy. SMB had a very Bucs-Bowles sounding answer. “The secret sauce I would say is staying together. You gotta stay together. You gotta win when it matters. … November, December, January, playoff football, you gotta be on the same page,” Murphy-Bunting said. “The camaraderie goes a long way. And just being able to show up every single day and work and know what you’re working for. Not getting complacent with it, and just kind of understanding it’s always bigger than you.” Todd Bowles and current Bucs players put a lot of team success on the camaraderie SMB mentioned. Players will say it’s what kept the Bucs together through the traditional Bowles-Bucs midseason lull that ends with a quality run and a division title. That unity also is a reason Joe thinks the Bucs often turn back to former players in times of need. And it’s why Joe thinks versatile safety Mike Edwards returning (again) in free agency this year along with Bucs sacks king Shaq Barrett is very much on Licht’s mind.|2025-02-14 14:17:00|312|19|8|Sean Murphy-Bunting|"Former Bucs players share ""secret sauce"" for team success."|8|Mixed sentiment leaning towards optimism with some concerns about player performance and team dynamics.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""bucsfan990"", ""post"": ""I want him back"", ""post_time"": [""February"", ""14th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""2:52"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Aqualung"", ""post"": ""SMB hasn\u2019t regressed, he\u2019s improved.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/mike-evans-credits-kyle-trask/|Mike Evans Credits Kyle Trask|Bucs fans have enjoyed four years of Kyle Trask mystery.  Is this guy any good? Can he be a starting quarterback? Nobody knows. The 2021 second-round draft pick has barely played and he’s about to turn 27 years old. Will the Bucs re-sign Trask in free agency? His rookie contract is about to expire. Joe is very curious to see if the Bucs cut Trask a check, or if any other team is interested in him as a No. 2 QB rather than a No. 3. Buccaneers Ring of Honor general manager Jason Licht has said he would have been comfortable starting Kyle Trask in the 2023 season if Baker Mayfield didn’t win the job. This week, Mike Evans gave Trask a hell of a compliment. It almost felt like a farewell ‘thank you.’ Evans told Loose Cannons that he owed gratitude to Trask for making him a better player. That’s right, Evans said Trask is “my boy” and Trask “can play.” Evans said Trask is improving each year and is a great teammate. Evans added that he’s caught a lot of balls from Trask in practice and receivers need quality QB play in practice in order to improve, and Trask made that happen for him. Joe doesn’t have a strong feeling about Trask returning or moving on. How could Joe? Trask is an unknown. However, Joe is an empathetic guy and will feel badly for the Trask cult if he leaves Tampa and actually plays some quality football somewhere else.|2025-02-14 14:00:00|251|54|7|Mike Evans|Evans praises Trask's contribution to his performance.|6|Mixed opinions on Trask's potential, uncertainty about his future and value as a backup.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""AL121976"", ""post"": ""I wouldn\u2019t be upset if they kept him.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/the-lions-and-jamel-dean/|The Lions And Jamel Dean|One of the great scoops during the dawn of 2024 free agency had to do with the Buccaneers’ defensive backfield. Jeremy Fowler of ESPN seemingly came out of nowhere with word that the Bucs were interested in trading Jamel Dean or Carlton Davis. And guess what? Three days later, off went Davis to the Lions in exchange for a 2024 third-round draft pick. The Lions also got a 2024 sixth-round pick and 2025 sixth-round draft pick from the Bucs. The third-rounder sent to Tampa was the No. 92 overall pick, which became eight-touchdown rookie Bucs receiver Jalen McMillan. Well done, Jason Licht! That Fowler report still intrigues Joe. If true, which it sure seems to have been, the Bucs were willing to part with Dean, who has become a punching bag for Bucs fans. Many fans — and Sage of Tampa Bay Sports Ira Kaufman — are repulsed by Dean’s ball skills and think he’s approaching Jermaine Phillips’ level of brittle. Those aren’t the qualities a team should want in its high-paid cornerback. So Joe believes Dean’s status for the 2025 Bucs is shaky. If a team was considering dealing you once, then it’s highly likely that option remains on the table. Dean can play, but he can’t be counted on, and he’s set to earn $12.5 million this season. The Bucs would preserve about $8.5 million in salary cap room if they get rid of him by cut or trade. Joe’s looking at Detroit as a potential option because if they thought Davis fit their defense, then they probably think Dean does as well. They’re similar players. Davis played well for Detroit but he stayed injury prone and missed four regular season games plus the playoffs. Now he’s a free agent that will be in demand on a multi-year deal. Joe can’t see the Lions giving up great draft capital for Dean, but perhaps they’d throw in a young linebacker or interior offensive lineman that excites Buccaneers Ring of Honor general manager Jason Licht.|2025-02-14 12:16:00|335|42|7.5|Jamel Dean|Bucs trade Dean with questions on potential|3|Mixed sentiments about player Dean's performance, injuries, salary, potential trades, and team strategy.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""BuckyBuc"", ""post"": ""do it asap"", ""post_time"": [""February"", ""14th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""12:22"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Saskbucs"", ""post"": ""Yeah I think I cut bait unless we think that salary is worth keeping some CB depth  but 12.5 for a number 3 is steep!

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/logan-hall-is-not-a-concern/|Logan Hall Is Not A Concern|The man behind WalterFootball.com, Walter Cherepinsky, seems to be irked by Logan Hall. After the 2024 season, Bucs coach Todd Bowles praised Hall, the 33rd overall pick in the 2022 draft. Now Hall may not have the numbers fans would expect from such a high draft pick but it’s clear Bowles groomed Hall to take Will Gholston’s place. Hall seems to have done that quite well. Not well enough for Cherepinsky. Logan Hall was taken atop the second round in 2022, but he hasn’t lived up to his draft status. An upgrade could be obtained on the defensive line. Well, Joe gets what Cherepinsky types — that one would expect more from Hall. But again, Gholston didn’t rack up a bunch of stats, either. He did eat up blocks. The Bucs have too many glaring holes on the defense to loose sleep over Hall. We know the Bucs need an edge rusher in the absolute worst way. The Bucs certainly need an inside linebacker and maybe two if Lavonte David retires. And Joe thinks the Bucs need to move on from Jamel Dean and perhaps Jordan Whitehead. With Dean, he may fall into Raheem Morris’ famous saying, “I’ll tolerate you until I can replace you.” Right now, the Bucs don’t have a replacement. But Hall? Nah, he’s far down the needs list. If he’s executing what the coaches want, it really shouldn’t matter where he was drafted.|2025-02-14 10:30:00|237|21|4|Logan Hall|Mixed opinions on Logan Hall's performance and future with Bucs.|5|Mixed feelings about Logan Hall's performance, potential for improvement, and team priorities.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Austin"", ""post"": ""Took a pretty good step this year, don\u2019t see why he can\u2019t take another one"", ""post_time"": [""February"", ""14th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""10:38"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""StickinUp4Centers"", ""post"": ""That being said, wouldn\u2019t be mad if BPA was another DL that wrecks havoc."", ""post_time"": [""February"", ""14th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""10:39"", ""am""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""FilthyAnimal"", ""post"": ""Hall is fine.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/myles-garrett-and-the-bucs/|Myles Garrett And The Bucs|The question for Joe is not if the Bucs should be interested in disgruntled Browns defensive end Myles Garrett. The question should be, why the hell wouldn’t they be? An edge rusher is the most important position on a defense. And since the Bucs damn near ran it back in 2021, the Bucs have been bereft of an edge rush that might startle an old woman. Over at BSPN, follicly-challenged Billy Barnwell thinks the Bucs should be interested in Garrett. Billy thinks, like Joe, Garrett could put the defense over the edge, Interestingly, Billy doesn’t believe Garrett would cost the Bucs more than one first round pick and he thinks the Bucs’ edge rush isn’t a priority. …They have to work on re-signing veterans Lavonte David, Chris Godwin and Ben Bredeson, and edge rusher isn’t a real point of weakness. Todd Bowles’ defense also generates so much of its pressure with blitzes, so Garrett might mean more for a team that rushes four and relies on the defensive line to get home. … Well, first off, Calijah Kancey is not an edge rusher as Barnwell claims in the linked story. Bucs coach Todd Bowles uses him there at times because: 1) The Bucs suck at edge rush and, 2) Kancey’s speed and size is a pass protection nightmare for some tackles and all running backs. Not a real weakness at edge rush? Well, through 14 games last year, the Bucs’ best edge rusher was a backup. So yeah, Joe thinks it is safe to say edge rush is a Grand Canyon-sized weakness. If Joe didn’t think the Bucs were a good edge rusher away from a Super Bowl run, Joe would be slightly content letting YaYa Diaby try to work through his struggles of the first 14 games last year. YaYa had a strong push at the end of the season. Joe really doesn’t care about the name of the Bucs’ next edge rusher — Myles Garrett, Trey Hendrickson, Josh Sweat, Haason Reddick. Just get a proven sack artist in here who won’t quit on the team after he signs his contract.|2025-02-14 07:00:00|352|51|4|Myles Garrett|Bucs consider adding him to boost defense.|4|Mixed opinions on pursuing Garrett due to cap, chemistry, and performance concerns.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""LEWI"", ""post"": ""We got to restructure ALOT of people to pull this off, I do think there is a chance even if its minor"", ""post_time"": [""February"", ""14th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""7:18"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Colonel Angus"", ""post"": ""That would be the best use of our draft picks if winning now is our priority, which it should be.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/the-case-for-ben-bredeson/|The Case For Ben Bredeson|Joe doesn’t get this, someone help Joe out. What’s the problem with Ben Bredeson? The Bucs’ left guard was a starter on one of the NFL’s best offensive lines. The Bucs finished third in passing and fourth in rushing. Still, Joe sees from time to time Bucs fans looking for a replacement. Why? If he was so bad, how could the Bucs have had one of the best offenses in the game? Over at Yahoo!, NFL columnist Frank Schwab took at a look at the Bucs’ main free agents. Key free agents WR Chris Godwin LB Lavonte David OLB Joe Tryon-Shoyinka G Ben Bredeson Who’s in/out: The decisions on Godwin and David will be interesting. They’re franchise legends, but David is 35 years old and Godwin is coming off a major leg injury. Tryon-Shoyinka and Bredeson are starters, and it will be interesting to see how the Buccaneers prioritize them. Joe will get this out of the way: Joe would be very, very surprised if Joe Tryon-Shoyinka is back. Partly because the Bucs are done with him but mostly his agent likely wants JTS to go somewhere that he thinks JTS will be developed and not have to worry about covering Adam Thielen. Bredeson? Joe has no idea why they would let him walk, unless a team swooped in and dropped an insane amount of cash in his lap. Joe does not believe in fixing something not broken. The offensive line is not broken, not even close. And remember, Bredeson played just to the left of a rookie center who hadn’t played the position in three years. Who knows how many times Michigan Man Bredeson bailed out Graham Barton. Shoot, the stat aggregator Football Insights had the Bucs as the second-best pass-blocking line in the game. You can’t tell Joe that Bredeson is a stiff. So long as Bredeson doesn’t get some crazy offer from another team, Joe sees no reason for the Bucs to want to disrupt one of the best offensive lines in the game. Like any in-house free agent, Bredeson can re-sign at any moment, long before he hits the market next month.|2025-02-14 03:45:00|356|37|7|Ben Bredeson|Defends Ben Bredeson's value on Bucs' offensive line.|4|Mixed opinions on re-signing Bredeson, with some supporting continuity and others favoring potential replacements.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""FlBoy84"", ""post"": ""Agreed on Bredeson, made a similar case on another post re: Hainsey.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/i-thought-i-pooped-the-bed-with-tampa-at-the-combine/|“I Thought I Pooped The Bed … With Tampa At The Combine”|It’s always neat to look back at the draft process of some players. And Bucs All-Pro left tackle Tristan Wirfs offered up a couple of fun anecdotes about his. The stories of how former Bucs tight end foot-rubbing Rob Gronkowski should have never been drafted by New England are famous. He did almost everything wrong in his interview in their building but punch a coach. The funniest of the stories included then-New England offensive coordinator Bill O’Brien sticking Gronk in a room. O’Brien told him to break down tape and give him a report when he returned. When O’Brien returned, Gronk was curled up on the floor sound sleep. Wirfs, speaking with Ari Meirov of The33rdTeam, didn’t have quite as crazy of a story, but it’s good. Wirfs actually thought there was no way the Bucs would draft him. Though he didn’t offer specifics, Wirfs said he blew chunks in his meeting with the Bucs at the combine. Later while on a Zoom call with the Bucs, he was late. In other words, Wirfs was convinced he didn’t make a good impression. How wrong he was. “I didn’t think I was going to Tampa,” Wirfs said. “I thought I pooped the bed in the interview with Tampa at the combine. And then they were actually my first [Zoom call]. “The pre-draft interviews after the combine normally they’re in person, but it was COVID. We’re all on Zoom. They’re my first Zoom meeting. I’ve never used Zoom before. “I was like two or three minutes late because I couldn’t figure out how to get logged on. I was like, ‘I blew it. They hate me.'” Then came draft night and Wirfs found out the opposite was true: The Bucs loved him. Enough to trade up to get him. “I was ecstatic after that,” Wirfs said. “I was excited to get down there.” Meirov asked Wirfs if being the fourth tackle selected motivated him to have such a strong rookie season, as if to show the rest of the NFL they made a mistake passing on him. After a long pause to think, Wirfs said, “Maybe. Maybe a little bit.” What did motivate Wirfs, he said, was knowing he would have to block for Tom Brady. “You know, when [the Bucs] called me on draft night, they’re like, ‘You ready to protect Tom Brady?’ And I was like, ‘I’ll get ready.’ That was kind of on top of my mind.” And Wirfs came out and played like he was a five-year veteran. The Bucs, and all Bucs fans, knew right off the bat when he stonewalled Cam Jordan in Week 1, that Bucs AC/DC-loving general manager Jason Licht discovered the Hope Diamond, very likely the best offensive lineman in Bucs franchise history.|2025-02-14 00:00:00|460|24|8|Tristan Wirfs|Wirfs impresses Tampa despite initial doubts.|6|Mixed opinions on Gruber and Wirfs, with some high praise and skepticism.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Mr. Creosote"", ""post"": ""I love Gruber and he should be in the HOF but Tristan is better."", ""post_time"": [""February"", ""14th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""12:03"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Steven007"", ""post"": ""Gruber in the Hall of Fame?
