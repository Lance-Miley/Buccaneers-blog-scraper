https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/11/we-dont-need-any-new-players/|“We Don’t Need Any New Players”|Don’t you dare imply to Todd Bowles that his roster could use an upgrade.He doesn’t want to hear it.The Bucs have all the talent they need to win.“We don’t need any new players. No doubt about it,” Bowles said today. “If we stop making the mistakes that we’re making, we’re in every game at the end, we gotta turn it around and turn the losses into wins.”Joe can’t argue much with Bowles here. The Bucs are 4-6 but easily could have two more wins under their belts. They’ve lost two games in overtime and then there was yesterday’s blown fourth-quarter lead and blown shot to put the game away late.The Bucs may not need new players, but they sure need old players. The majority of wide receiver snaps yesterday went to Ryan Miller and Rakim Jarrett. That’s quite a giant step down from Mike Evans and Chris Godwin.Hopefully, Evans returns in New Jersey against the Giants on Nov. 24, following this week’s bye.In the meantime, Bowles will take his coaches and players back to the lab to get the defense right, and more.|2024-11-11 20:13:00|183|99|4|Todd Bowles|Bowles confident in existing talent despite team's challenges|7| Mixed sentiments on coaching vs. players|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Durango 95"", ""post"": ""Bowles is likely right.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/11/nfl-com-bucs-playoff-probability-is-33-percent/|NFL.com: Bucs’ Playoff Probability Is 33 Percent|So you’re telling me there’s a chance! Joe’s hearing the famous Dumb And Dumber line echoing through the beer-stained halls of JoeBucsFan.com world headquarters.The Bucs are reeling on a four-game losing streak and the defense is struggling to look professional.At 4-6, the Bucs are what their record says they are. But the great news is the same axiom applies their opponents!!! And the Bucs only have one opponent out of seven remaining that currently has more than three wins.The data nerds at NFL.com claim the Bucs have a 33 percent chance to make the postseason, via wild card or division title.Bucs fans that have yet to smash everything in their homes and are dialed into the playoff chase might want to watch tonight’s Monday Night Football game. It’s the Dolphins against the Rams (4-4) and NFL.com says the Rams will have a 26 percent shot at the NFC playoffs if they win tonight, or a 12 percent chance if they lose.ESPN says the Bucs have a 22 percent shot at the postseason and the New York Times model puts Tampa Bay at 15 percent.All this data crunching is hilarious. It reminds Joe of how some people believe election exit-poll data is accurate.Regardless, this is just a fun math exercise. None of this gets real unless the Bucs win their next three games — against the brutal Giants (2-8), the weak Panthers (3-7)  and the bumbling Raiders (2-7).At 7-6, the Bucs would be a true contender for the postseason.|2024-11-11 19:02:00|248|28|7|Bucs' Playoff Probability|Bucs have a shot at the postseason despite recent struggles.|6| Mixed sentiments on Buccaneers' playoff chances and coaching staff.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Mike Johnson"", ""post"": ""Now what is the probability of Coach Bowles been fire right now?\nWe need to make a statement.
