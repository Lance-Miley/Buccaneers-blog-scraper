https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/todd-bowles-and-frankie-luvu/|Todd Bowles And Frankie Luvu|Joe painfullly confesses to being a Frankie Luvu admirer. The Commanders linebacker, who the Bucs will see plenty of on Sunday night, plays so darn hard and has a such a unique story. Unfortunately, Luvu had a bunch of strong games against the Bucs with the Panthers before landing in Washington on a massive free agent contract in March. Luvu’s strip of Bucs receiver Trey Palmer in the season finale last year nearly gave Joe a heart attack (Bucs won 9-0 on the road). And in a critical Bucs-Panthers game in Week 17 of the 2022 season, Luvu sacked Tom Brady and found his way to 13 combined tackles and three tackles for loss. The guy was all over the field. Joe expects the same for Luvu on Sunday. For the Commanders’ defense, he’s Mr. Everything. Luvu has 8 sacks and a team-leading 14 quarterback hits. He blitzes a lot and lines up in various positions, and he covers well. Joe has thrown darts at Todd Bowles’ history of not developing an edge rusher. So it’s sort of ironic that Luvu was a 2018 undrafted rookie with the Jets when Bowles was head coach. Luvu was a surprise darling of Jets camp and made the team as an edge rusher out of Washington State. He had a good rookie year but then Bowles was fired after the season. Joe watched Luvu in a video interview at Commanders training camp this season and he said he had a lot of fun playing for Bowles and then lost his love of football quickly in his two Jets seasons without Bowles. Eventually, Luvu moved to inside linebacker and found his calling as a dynamic player with the Panthers. He appears even more versatile this year playing alongside future Hall of Fame linebacker and Commanders leading tackler Bobby Wagner. Yeah, Joe is concerned about Luvu causing trouble for the Bucs offense and his old coach.|2025-01-09 21:51:00|321|10|8|Frankie Luvu|Commanders linebacker impresses with versatile play against former coach.|4|Mixed opinions on Todd Bowles' coaching abilities, with some skepticism and acknowledgment of improvement.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Big Joe"", ""post"": ""You see?

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/fighting-to-the-finish/|Fighting To The Finish|BY IRA KAUFMAN There’s still time for the Buccaneers to order an inspirational T-shirt they can wear during warmups before Sunday night’s playoff game. You’ve heard the message before and it fits this football team to a T: Tough times don’t last, tough people do. That phrase applies to the 2024 Bucs in so many ways. Start with the 4-6 trench they found themselves in, dropping them three games behind the Falcons in the NFC South.  Injuries were mounting, along with turnovers, and it would have been easy for players and coaches to conclude this just isn’t Tampa Bay’s year. Instead, a 6-1 stretch drive vaulted the Bucs to the NFC’s No. 3 playoff seed heading into Sunday’s prime-time matchup against the Commanders. “It’s a group of guys who just won’t go down,” Cody Mauch told me in the aftermath of the regular-season finale. “We definitely dug ourselves a hole, but this is a group that wants to go to the playoffs and make some noise.” These Bucs have been at their best when it counts the most. They boast a 247-135 scoring advantage in the second half and the latest example of their resilience came last week, when they overcame a 16-6 halftime deficit against the Saints. This team looks adversity in the eye — and spits. Baker Mayfield leads the way by repeatedly raising his game in the final two quarters. Mayfield threw 11 of his 16 interceptions in the opening half and that ball security in the final 30 minutes has been a major factor. Mayfield’s legs have also been instrumental, especially as games progress. He ran for 118 yards and six first downs in the first half this season, followed by 262 yards and 18 first downs on the ground in the final two quarters. “Bake gets in some weird spots back there,” Mauch says. “Whether it’s pressure or an extra guy we can’t block, most quarterbacks are going down in that situation or they throw the ball away. Not Bake. He’s going to find a crease, he’s going to lower his shoulder and go to battle for us, so we’re trying to do the best we can for him.” No matter how the postseason unfolds, the Bucs can take pride in their physicality and mental toughness. It’s a tribute to the coaching staff and the kind of players Jason Licht welcomes into the building. “I know one thing,” says Tristan Wirfs. “We’re resilient as heck.” Want another way to measure this club’s tenacity? There are 17 teams, more than half the league, who finished the year with a negative turnover ratio. Only one team in that group is still playing — the Bucs at minus-5. This is not a franchise often lauded for its mental toughness, but things started to change when Tom Brady arrived in 2020. When No. 12 retired, the prevailing thought was the Bucs would struggle to remain relevant. Those fears turned out to be misplaced. Even the loss of Chris Godwin for the final 10 games couldn’t derail this locomotive. At the time, Godwin was Tampa Bay’s best player. Heck, he may have been the NFL’s premier wide receiver at that stage. Just another obstacle to overcome. These guys go about their business without fanfare … and without distractions. Sure, they tend to make it hard on themselves. Those dismal first halves against Dallas and New Orleans were tough to take for Buc fans, but this club won 10 games. Only nine teams had a better record. When these Bucs are down, they don’t stay down. They fight. Tough people fight. Bring on the T-shirts. |2025-01-09 18:48:00|604|18|8|Buccaneers|Resilient team overcomes adversity with tenacity and mental toughness.|2|Comments range from pessimistic doubts to optimistic support for the team.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""GoneGator"", ""post"": ""They could have easily sat around, like losers do, and blamed and complained.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/baker-mayfield-jump-starts-bucs/|Baker Mayfield Jump-Starts Bucs|Sometimes when a team is lethargic, coaches often try something unorthodox to shake it out of its funk. Take last Sunday playing the slimy Saints in a win-and-in game. One reason Bucs coach Todd Bowles signed off on going for it on fourth-and-eight in the second half is Bowles was trying to jolt his team to life. Prior to that, the Bucs played like their heads were somewhere else. Today, offensive coordinator Liam Coen admitted that sometimes this shock to the Bucs’ system comes organically when Baker Mayfield runs for a first down. “I definitely think that had something to do with us maybe waking up a little bit and getting things going,” Coen said of Mayfield’s scrambles. He ran 9 times for 68 yards. “We were maybe going through the motions a little bit sometimes in the first half. Not taking anything away from New Orleans – they had a great plan and did some good things against us, but we weren’t really playing at our highest level, if you just put it that way. Mayfield’s scrambles “helped the guys out, I think, getting a little bit of juices going. You ended up seeing some good things after that.” Joe couldn’t help but think of when the Bucs hosted Washington in 1998 in the divisional round at the crib formerly known as the CITS (community investment tax stadium). The Bucs offense was even sluggish by Father Dungy’s standards. In the second half, John Lynch picked off a Brad Johnson pass and he Gronk-spiked the ball right in front of the Bucs’ bench. It was right by the offense as if to say, “Will you guys get your heads out of your arses and play ball?!” And then Mike Alstott took over. The Bucs won and went on to face the Rams in the NFC title game. If it takes Mayfield to run to get the offense flowing, then by all means, run Baker, run!|2025-01-09 18:35:00|325|16|8|Baker Mayfield|Mayfield's runs energize Bucs|5|Mixed sentiments about Baker's impact, with both positive and critical comments from the audience.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""ReturnGrudenToRing"", ""post"": ""Baker had me when he did \u201cThe Block\u201d heard round the world."", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""9th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""6:46"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Anyhony"", ""post"": ""1999 season"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""9th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""7:07"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""JK"", ""post"": ""Or when he kinda maybe started a lil dustup and left his boys to clean it up.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/beware-raiders-may-poach-john-spytek/|Beware: Raiders May Poach John Spytek|While most Bucs fans are peeking between their fingers hoping Bucs offensive coordinator Liam Coen isn’t plucked by another coach-needy team, a key member of Bucs AC/DC-loving general manager Jason Licht’s staff has been floated as a target for a team that as of this afternoon is looking for a new general manager. Today in Las Vegas, Tom Brady Mark Davis canned Raiders general manager Tom Telesco, who is one of the better talent evaluators in the game. If you listen to a lot of SiriusXM NFL Radio and/or football podcasts like Joe does, many NFL insiders believe Brady is either calling the shots for the Raiders’ football operations or is “advising” Davis. Of course, last year Brady became a minority owner of the Raiders. This leads CBS NFL insider Jonathan Jones to speculate (?) Brady has his sights aimed at Bucs assistant general manager John Spytek. Their connections go back all the way to Ann Arbor when they were teammates at Michigan. @jjones9: The Raiders will have plenty of qualified candidates for their now vacant GM job. One name to keep an eye on: Bucs AGM John Spytek. He’s been a critical part of Jason Licht’s staff in Tampa and played with Tom Brady at Michigan. He’s also interviewing with the Titans. This makes sense. A huge reason Brady came to the Bucs in the spring of 2020 was the talent already on the roster. Spytek was a key person securing that talent. And in his three seasons with the Bucs, Brady saw first-hand how his former Wolverine brother-in-arms went about his business. Brady has called a handful of Bucs games in person this yar and has seen how that talent has developed. And knowing Brady (just a little), Joe is confident Brady has studied lots of Bucs film as he prepped for games. It would stink to lose either Mike Greenberg or Spytek, Licht’s valued and trusted lieutenants. Both hold the title of “assistant general manager.” But sooner or later one or both will run his own NFL franchise. Joe can think of a whole lot of worse places to live and work than booming Las Vegas.|2025-01-09 18:22:00|359|20|7|John Spytek|Raiders may target Bucs AGM Spytek for GM role.|5|Mixed sentiments towards front office staff leaving, trust in Jason Licht for replacements.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Jethro Tull"", ""post"": ""One more year\u2026..one more year\u2026\u2026.one more year\u2026\u2026."", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""9th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""6:26"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""ModHairKen"", ""post"": ""If they want to leave, can\u2019t stop them.

And the news is largely good. Lavonte David (knee) was upgraded from “limited” yesterday to a full participant today. Same for No. 1 tight end Cade Otton (knee). Another member of the knee club, starting safety Antoine Winfield, Jr. has been full-go all week. Otton has missed the past three games; Winfield has missed four. Still limited is starting cornerback Jamel Dean (knee), who missed Sunday’s game against the Saints. Replacement Josh Hayes has been hanging in there for Dean, but the competition level kicks up Sunday. Joe would feel much better if Dean is back in the lineup.  |2025-01-09 17:39:00|105|28|8|Cade Otton|Antoine Winfield|6|Mixed sentiment with optimism and concerns expressed about player performance and injuries.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Mike C"", ""post"": ""LFG!!!"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""9th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""5:45"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""unbelievable"", ""post"": ""Great news on those 3, and agree about needing Dean."", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""9th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""5:48"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""Inwoodjeremy"", ""post"": ""Evan\u2019s had a rest day."", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""9th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""5:58"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter3"": {""username"": ""Hawk"", ""post"": ""Evans had a \u2018casino\u2019 day."", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""9th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""6:02"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter4"": {""username"": ""ReeeBarrr"", ""post"": ""Great news!"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""9th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""6:04"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter5"": {""username"": ""Tbbucs3"", ""post"": ""Culp has filled in nicely for Otton\u2026."", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""9th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""6:07"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter6"": {""username"": ""MJ"", ""post"": ""dont forget Tykee has been huge!! thats 2 safeties back"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""9th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""6:15"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter7"": {""username"": ""JBBUCS_06"", ""post"": ""I\u2019m actually ok w/ Hayes as he\u2019s more aggressive than Dean with better short area/lateral quickness IMO.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/national-picks-going-to-bucs/|National Picks Trending To Bucs|Joe hears the national analysts leaning heavily but not completely in Tampa Bay’s direction for Sunday night against the Commanders.  NBC will have the broadcast and two of their chief analysts, former Bucs QB Chris Simms and ProFootballTalk.com guru Mike Florio, have picked the Bucs to win. So has Rob Gronkowski, which came during his recent visit to Up & Adams. CBS chief insider Prickly Pete Prisco is in the Bucs’ camp, thinking they’ll win in a shootout. His CBS colleague, Leger Douzable, a Tampa native who played for defensive end for Todd Bowles with the Jets, picked the Commanders. Douzable has been watching the Bucs secondary and doesn’t see them having enough to win. NFL Network’s Brian Baldinger, the former offensive lineman, already picked the Bucs to win on his podcast, The Best Football Show. Baldinger told an interesting story of chatting in a golf cart with Bowles at Bucs training camp, and he expressed how much confidence the Bucs have in every aspect of their operation. Remember, Baldinger is a pesonal friend of Calijah Kancey. Joe’s heard many other predictions out there, and the Bucs seem to be getting three out of four.|2025-01-09 13:57:00|195|31|8|National Picks Trending To Bucs|Analysts favor Bucs to win against Commanders in Sunday night matchup.|6|Mixed feelings about the Bucs game, hoping for a good defensive performance.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Cometowin2"", ""post"": ""Put $50 on the Bucs -3 to win over Commanders and still have $25 bets to win the NFC Championship and SB.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/liam-coen-confirms-only-one-head-coach-interview-request/|Liam Coen Confirms Only One Head Coach Interview Request|So the Bucs’ hot offensive coordinator may not be such a hot commodity across the NFL. Exhale, Bucs fan, but don’t get too comfortable. A report of Liam Coen planning to interview wiht the Jacksonville Jaguars for their open head coach gig was confirmed today by Coen at One Buc Palace. He also said he is unaware of any other teams interested in him for a head coach opening. That jibes with reports across the NFL landscape. An assistant coach on a team playing in the postseason (like Coen is) may interview for a head coaching job only after the first week of postseason games, per NFL rules, and it can only be via a streaming conference call. So expect Coen to interview with the Jags next week. Joe is nervous and Joe considers any thought of the Jaguars being an unattractive job to be ludicrous. Jacksonville has a talented young quarterback under contract, two good offensive tackles, a superstar rookie receiver and a solid young tight end, in addition to a young double-digit edge rusher. The Jags also have an owner with a history of giving head coaches a ton of rope. Heck, Jags owner Shad Khan gave brutal Gus Bradley four seasons, and he gave Doug Marrone a fourth season (2020) after his team imploded in 2019. The Jaguars also have plenty of salary cap room and play in a weak division. Joe also listened to Hall of Fame tackle Tony Boselli on Jacksonville media yesterday talk about how Khan intentionally has a head-coach-driven operation — meaning the general manager doesn’t wield most of the power. Regardless, Coen is here and doesn’t have a lot of options.

One has to go back 12 years to find a rookie quarterback who won a road playoff game. His name is Russell Wilson. In that 2012 season, the Seahawks handed the ball to their third-round draft pick and Wilson guided a balanced offense with a lockdown defense to a record of 11-5. Seattle went on the road to Washington on Wild Card weekend and beat another rookie QB, Robert Griffin III. Neither rookie QB had special stats. On Sunday, the Bucs will host stud rookie QB Jayden Daniels and a Washington team that isn’t as good as that Seattle club of years ago. Will Daniels be the first since Wilson to win on the road in the postseason? Per CBS, only three NFL rookie QBs have ever won a road playoff game. The numbers show Daniels has played strong on the road this season.|2025-01-09 12:57:00|162|23|6|Bucs vs. Commanders|Bucs are favored to win due to QB history.|2|Overall lack of confidence in the defense against Washington's QB and the outcome.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Tbbucs3"", ""post"": ""Against Todd Bowles defenses, I fear mediocre backups like Cooper Rush and Marcus Mariota more than I do pro bowlers"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""9th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""1:01"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Boge"", ""post"": ""I have no faith in Todd to shut down JD.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/two-ex-bucs-laud-liam-coen-creativity-slap-bruce-arians-byron-leftwich/|Two Ex-Bucs Laud Liam Coen Creativity; Slap Bruce Arians-Byron Leftwich Calls|How bout that Bucs running game! It’s literally the best rushing attack in franchise history. And it’s got two ex-Bucs in near disbelief — and taking a shot a former regime. So former Bucs tight end Cameron Brate (2014-2022) sat down with ex-Bucs defensive lineman Beau Allen (2018-2019) on the Green Light podcast. Yes, the subject of the Bucs offense arose and Brate gushed over the job new offensive coordinator Liam Coen has done. Essentially, Brate said, the Bucs have run three offenses well this season: the pass-heavy unit with Chris Godwin and Mike Evans healthy, the run-heavy group that saw Cade Otton shine with lots of two-back sets when Evans was lost for three weeks after Godwin got hurt, and then a new look when Evans returned and Bucky Irving became a prime focus. Both Brate and Allen have been blown away by the Bucs’ running game, and how much it’s changed and improved. “So creative, the pony (two-running back) personnel packages. They had a few plays they ran this year, I have actually no idea how [Coen] had the balls to call them,” Brate said. “Like he was pulling the front-side guard and tackle away from the play hoping the D-Tackle and D-end would pinch. And it worked. Just really creative in both the run game and the screen game.” Allen responded that he thinks Coen’s time calling plays in college helped him be creative versus what was seen under Arians-Leftwich rushing attack. “Dude, with Bruce Arians for the Bucs, it was like, ‘Duo. Dive solid.’ You know what I mean? You double team and you get four yards,” Allen said. “It was horrible,” Brate quickly replied. Ouch! Yeah, Coen is a master at scheming the run. And he’s got his quarterback throwing for a 71 percent completion rate logging 40-plus touchdowns.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/extra-concern-for-lavonte-david-knee-injury/|Extra Concern For Lavonte David Knee Injury|Legendary Bucs linebacker Lavonte David had another strong season and the Bucs will be hurting if he retires instead of coming back for what would be his 14th NFL year. David turns 35 this month and everything looked great for his return, Joe believed. The Bucs are a contender. His beloved head coach, Todd Bowles, will be back. Joe knows the team wants David back and he’ll get a nice contract offer. And David played all 17 regular-season games and stayed healthy. Well, some air went out of that happy balloon yesterday for Joe. David appeared on the Bucs’ injury report with a knee issue and was classifed as “limited.” What if David struggles with that knee for remainder of the Bucs’ season, whether that’s one game or four? Joe thinks ending the year injured could be enough to get David to lean toward retirement. David was on the fence about retiring last January. Fans heard his mic’d up comments to former Lions backup quarterback Teddy Bridgewater coming off the field in Detroit. Wealthy old players’ attitudes and how injuries can affect them are always linked. So Joe really hopes David’s knee is nothing more than a very minor tweak.|2025-01-09 11:29:00|200|28|5|Lavonte David|Concern over knee injury potentially affecting retirement decision.|5|Mixed feelings on Lavonte David's future and the team's needs|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Lord Cornelius"", ""post"": ""Hard to really hypothesize anything without knowing what the actual injury is.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/ex-buc-marshon-lattimore-is-in-mike-evans-head/|Ex-Buc: Marshon Lattimore Is In Mike Evans’ Head|So it’s possible that Commanders cornerback Marshon Lattimore, the four-time Saints Pro Bowler, will play Sunday night against the Bucs. Most Bucs fans know Mike Evans and Lattimore have had stunning battles since the Saints drafted Lattimore in Round 1 of the 2017 NFL Draft. Lattimore probably leads the 1-on-1 matchups, which have included historic fights. Lattimore, 28, isn’t what he used to be, but his tank isn’t empty. Washington traded for him in November, coughing up third- and fourth-round picks. So will Evans care about seeing his old division rival. Listening to ex-Bucs tight end Cameron Brate, Joe concludes that Evans absolutely will care. “It is crazy watching those two go at it,” Brate said of a Lattimore-Evans matchup. “Both of them are not thinking about the game; they are thinking about that rep and embarrassing the other person.” Brate said while fans remember the fights, it’s a nonstop war. “… It’s truly every single play the entire game. Like Mike is preparing when he plays Marshon like 50 percent for a football game, 50 percent for a fight. I’m pretty sure he’s in his locker watching boxing highlights before a game,” Brate said. The comments came during Brate’s visit to the Green Light podcast. Joe hopes Lattimore’s bad hamstring needs more time and he sits on Sunday. After weeks of streak-related distraction, Evans deserves a clear head.|2025-01-09 11:15:00|229|27|7|Marshon Lattimore|Historic battles between Lattimore and Evans intensify Sunday night game.|6|Mixed sentiments with cautious optimism and concern over Lattimore's impact on Mike Evans.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Bucshot"", ""post"": ""Epic Sunday Night Awaits!"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""9th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""11:22"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""BakerFan"", ""post"": ""I want Mike to embarrass him\u2026"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""9th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""11:26"", ""am""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""BillyBucco"", ""post"": ""No way he doesn\u2019t play.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/hes-one-of-the-toughest-smaller-guys-ive-seen-since-ive-been-in-the-league/|“He’s One Of The Toughest Smaller Guys I’ve Seen Since I’ve Been In The League”|When Bucs coach Todd Bowles broke into the league as a safety in  1986, the NFL was far different than today. While the NFL wasn’t quite the back alley brawl it was in the 1970s, when dudes were legally getting clotheslined and spearing knees five yards out of bounds was considered hard-nosed legal football, the NFL in Bowles’ era was anything but the don’t-hit-too-hard league it became under the boot of NFL warden Roger Goodell. So when Bowles, the Bucs’ head coach, raved about his star rookie running back Bucky Irving yesterday, he made a comment about Irving that really grabbed Joe’s attention. “He’s a complete football player,” Bowles said of Bucky. “He’s one of the toughest smaller guys I’ve seen since I’ve been in the league.” Now that is a compliment. Remember, when Bowles came into the league, Lawrence Taylor and Ronnie Lott were still patrolling fields at the height of their unmatched careers. They didn’t come much tougher than those two. So consider what Bowles’ frame of reference is when he refers to someone as “tough.” Yeah, Bowles qualified his praise of Bucky as a “smaller guy,” but still, tough in Bowles’ era is a whole lot different than tough for 40 years later. How tough is Irving? Against the slimy Saints he took vicious hits. The way the slimy Saints played last Sunday, it looked like they were trying to take guys out. But Bucky had his second-most snaps (48) in a game against the slimy Saints. His busiest game, 49 snaps, also came against the slimy Saints back in October. The way Bowles spoke of Bucky it sounds like Bowles thinks he has been a godsend. “[Whether] making guys miss or shoving guys off or spinning out of things or doing whatever he does to make extra yards has been great for us,” Bowles said. “And he takes care of the football while he’s at it. That’s special.” Ah, spoken like a true blue defensive guy. 🙂 But Bowles is right, Bucky has been the sparkplug the team has been seeking since Father Time caught Playoff Lenny from behind. The old saying is that running the ball in the playoffs is a winning formula. Well, if that’s the case, and the way the Commandos can’t defend the run, then Bucky ought to run the Bucs to the divisional round next week.|2025-01-09 09:00:00|395|20|"Sentiment score: 8

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/zyon-mccollum-motivated-by-disappointment/|Zyon McCollum Motivated By Disappointment|Is Zyon McCollum already one of the better corners in the league? Well, maybe. McCollum, in his first year starting for the Bucs, finished with 17 passes defensed this season. Denzel Ward of the Browns finished first with 19. Derek Stingley of the Texans had 18. McCollum came in third, tied with Mike Jackson of the Stinking Panthers. Joe thinks that’s good. McCollum has a different view. In fact, McCollum believes despite so many passes defended, he failed to turn several into picks. “I have to turn those into interceptions,” were the first words out of McCollum’s mouth when Joe mentioned that stat to him on Wednesday. “I will never be satisfied. It is a tremendous honor to start and play in this league and to make plays.” In fact, if McCollum met his personal goals, he may have been a Pro Bowler. “My goal starting this year was to make six interceptions,” McCollum said. “I fell short of that. I am disappointed in that but it’s going to motivate me to work harder.” Had McCollum grabbed six picks, he would have ranked third in the league in interceptions. Still, McCollum didn’t want to hear any praise. “I’m making plays on the ball,” McCollum noted. “Now I have to turn those plays into interceptions.” McCollum has had sort of a quiet, really solid year. Joe was uneasy about the Bucs shipping Carlton Davis to Detroit in the offseason because, just based on McCollum’s play as a spot starter, Joe wasn’t sure he was ready. McCollum showed he was ready and more than capable of being an NFL starter.|2025-01-09 07:00:00|268|23|7|Zyon McCollum|McCollum aims higher despite impressive stats.|8|Positive outlook on Zyon's potential and performance, with some minor concerns and constructive feedback.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Bonan"", ""post"": ""In the game last week he missed a tackle, got up and was still there around the ball at the end of the play.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/nextgen-stats-rewards-tristan-wirfs/|NextGen Stats Rewards Tristan Wirfs|Mary Ann may not be on this island, but for the Bucs, there’s a mountain of a left tackle that protects its beaches. One reason you don’t see a whole lot about offensive linemen as stars of the NFL or the face of a franchise — or drooled over on the various hollering shows on sports cable networks — is that there is no way to gauge truly how good a guy is from the outside of an NFL facility. Oh, Joe guesses charting pancake blocks is one way, but that’s almost irresponsible. That’s like determining how good a receiver is by his 40-yard dash. So this is why Joe likes how NextGen Stats decided to single out what the computerized formula spat out as the best left tackle in the game. Per its data derived from computer chips embedded in players’ equipment, NextGen Stats selected Bucs left tackle Tristan Wirfs as its All-Pro left tackle. It seems the data on Wirfs blocking on “an island,” or one-on-one matchups, says he may let a defender visi but rarely does the defender get to stay long. In his second season manning the blindside after making the transition from right tackle, Wirfs handled more one-on-one pass-blocking snaps than any left tackle in the league (87.1%) — and he thrived in those situations. Wirfs more than delivered when left on an island, allowing just a 5.0% pressure rate in one-on-one situations, the lowest of any left tackle with at least 100 island snaps this season. Across all pass-blocking reps, Wirfs surrendered pressure on just 4.7% of dropbacks — second-best among left tackles — and allowed just 1.5 sacks all year. Yes, “this Joe” will fully stand up and admit not liking the thought of moving Wirfs to left tackle. Joe thought Wirfs was having a Hall of Fame career as a right tackle. And it’s against every fiber of Joe’s being to fix something not broken. And Wirfs at right tackle was not broken. Joe is happy as hell that Wirfs is now dominating at left tackle. “Relieved” might be a better word. Joe still thinks Trent Williams is the best left tackle in football (not by much) and that’s no knock on Wirfs. Williams is that good. But Williams was hurt a lot this season. And Wirfs’ team is getting ready for a playoff game on Sunday night, prime time. The 49ers are in Cancun.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/yaya-diaby-in-elite-company/|YaYa Diaby In Elite Company|So yesterday, Bucs outside linebacker/edge rush YaYa Diaby was named NFC Defensive Player of the Week. He’s been on a hot streak the past three weeks. YaYa has 2.5 sacks and six quarterback hits in his last three games. He’s turning it up at the right time as the Bucs head to the playoffs. YaYa yesterday sounded like a home run hitter who said the secret to his success was not trying to swing for the fence all the time. “I just stopped focusing on the sacks,” YaYa said about his uptick in sacks. He finished the season with 4.5. “For me, I was always, ‘I’ve got to get a sack. I’ve got to get a sack,’ and these last couple weeks, I’ve just been playing free. I’m really just being myself. “All the negative outsiders saying what I can do and what I can’t do, I honestly don’t care about that [any] more. I’m just playing my game in the way I need to play to help this team win.” YaYa joined impressive company with the numbers he has put up in his first 34 games of NFL football. Since 2017, YaYa is the sixth player to record 12 sacks, 25 quarterback hits and 25 tackles for loss across his first 34 career games played. Wait until you get a load of the other five: Micah Parsons, Nick Bosa, Maxx Crosby, Bradley Chubb and Myles Garrett. Hopefully — hopefully! — YaYa is finally the guy the Bucs have needed since Father Time clotheslined Jason Pierre-Paul and Bucs sacks king Shaq Barrett blew out his Achilles. The Bucs desperately need a consistent, top-shelf edge rusher. Joe catches hell from every corner of One Buc Palace for non-stop griping about the lack of an edge rush. The reason Joe does this is because an edge rush is so vital for a defense to be stout and a team to win. Joe doesn’t have a lick of power to correct this. But folks at One Buc Palace do. The three times in Bucs franchise history the Bucs had a ferocious edge rush, the worst the team did was make it to the NFC Championship game. Coincidence? Oh, no.
