https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/i-keep-hearing-liam-coen/|“I Keep Hearing ‘Liam Coen'”|These are words many Bucs fans don’t want to read. In a perfect world for these same fans, the Bucs would launch Todd Bowles, fresh off another division title and a 10-win season, to make room for Bucs offensive coordinator Liam Coen to take over. Instead, it appears Coen is the leader in the clubhouse to take over a different Florida NFL franchise. That would be the Jags. Late this afternoon, “Good Morning Football” co-host Peter Schrager, who seems to have contacts within every NFL team, joined the one and only Chris “Mad Dog” Russo for Schrager’s weekly spot heard exclusively on SiriusXM Radio. There, Schrager uttered the words Bucs fans are dreading: “I keep hearing ‘Liam Coen,'” Schrager told Russo when Russo asked him about the Jags’ coaching search. “So I’m going to pencil him in.” However, Schrager told Russo the search is not over. Schrager emphasized Robert Salah has an outside shot of overtaking Coen and landing the job. Salah, who has a second interview with the Jags scheduled Friday, would fit right in with Jacksonville. Outside of the Jets (and the Bears), there is no more of a rudderless organization than the Jags. So there you have it, Bucs fans. As the sun sets on this cold Tuesday afternoon, it sure feels that the chances that Coen bolts are better than 50/50.|2025-01-21 17:56:00|225|110|4|Liam Coen|Concerns over offensive coordinator possibly leaving Bucs for Jags.|4|Mixed feelings on retaining or losing Coen and Bowles, with some faith in potential replacements.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Pink"", ""post"": ""Fire Bowles"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""21st,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""6:03"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Mike S"", ""post"": ""The reason you\u2019re losing Cohen is because the Bears got their rudder\ud83d\ude02"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""21st,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""6:05"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""GoneGator"", ""post"": ""Fire Coen"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""21st,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""6:05"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter3"": {""username"": ""LEWI"", ""post"": ""Imo it would be dumb for him to go, we\u2019re a much better organization, but there are only 32 jobs"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""21st,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""6:06"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter4"": {""username"": ""LEWI"", ""post"": ""Hope we play the Jags every year and smash them"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""21st,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""6:07"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter5"": {""username"": ""Bring back the lawn chairs"", ""post"": ""Truthfully, anyone would consider themselves lucky to be a coordinator with Bucky Irving, Mike Evans, baker mayfield, and this offensive line.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/it-probably-wont-be-anytime-soon/|“It Probably Won’t Be Anytime Soon”|So most NFL teams employ a 24-hour rule after a win or a loss. Agonize or celebrate for a day and then let it go. Ancient history. That’s not the case for the season-ending game when it comes to head coach Todd Bowles. The agony of defeat has no set limit when it means the end of the season, Bowles said last week after the crushing playoff loss to the Commanders. “It’s not going away anytime soon,” Bowles said. “You live with it. You look at it. You see how hard everybody fought and you slowly start to tweak things you can do better and eventually you get over it and come around, and you kind of move forward. But it probably won’t be anytime soon.” Bowles’ comments came on the Buccaneers Radio Network. The head coach emphasized that Baker Mayfield shouldn’t take his critical, fourth-quarter fumbled exchange with Jalen McMillen too hard because he had “a hell of year.”|2025-01-21 16:42:00|160|27|5|Todd Bowles|Bowles reflects on season-ending loss|4|Mixed feelings about team performance, some optimism but also frustration and criticism.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Saskbucs"", ""post"": ""Just please learn from it Todd.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/the-light-finally-came-on-for-him/|“The Light Finally Came On For Him”|Given the events of this week, Joe feels this is a fine time for a Logan Hall post. The Bucs’ run defense was excellent this season and third-year starter Logan Hall was in the thick of it at defensive end. He also found 5 1/2 sacks, which surprised Joe and man other fans. Bucs defensive line coach Kacy Rodgers, now a busy free agent, applauded Hall’s transformation during a wrap up of the season on the Buccaneers Radio Network. “Year 1 was kind of feeling his way. Year 2, you was kind of seeing [him] turn the corner but we weren’t having any production. He wasn’t producing the numbers we needed,” Rodgers said of Hall. “Year 3, it’s just I feel like the light finally came on for him. I feel like he had a tremendous offseason. And now you’re seeing him.” Rodgers further emphasized Hall wasn’t bad in 2023, just not posting the stats. Rodgers stressed that Hall is very underappreciated as a pass rusher, and now a sack artist, because he’s often off the field in passing situations. However, per Rodgers, Todd Bowles adjusted and put Hall in more positions to affect quarterbacks. “We created another package where Logan, Vita [Vea] and Calijah [Kancey] stayed on the field on third down,” he said. Development! It’s a beautiful thing. Joe still tosses and turns in bed at night hoping the Bucs can find this kind of magic when it comes to edge rushers.|2025-01-21 12:21:00|244|29|8|Logan Hall|Emerging as a standout pass rusher for the Buccaneers.|5|Mixed sentiments on player development and coaching, varying from criticism to hopefulness for improvement.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Brian in St Pete"", ""post"": ""Hall was my \u201cmost improved\u201d defensive player when having end of year Bucs discussions with my buddy."", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""21st,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""12:49"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""El HEFE"", ""post"": ""Hall needs to go to SUHS camp with Kancey and VEA"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""21st,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""1:03"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""stpetebucsfan"", ""post"": ""\u201cTodd Bowles adjusted\u201d  Oh noes!!!"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""21st,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""1:08"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter3"": {""username"": ""Tony"", ""post"": ""Dude has always had the talent.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/kacy-rodgers-leaving/|Kacy Rodgers Leaving?|It’s been eerily quiet at One Buc Palace recently, which is making Joe wonder what’s going on behind closed doors. Many (not all) Bucs fans have been hollering for Todd Bowles, fresh off a 10-win season and his third division title in as many years as Bucs head coach, to get run. In a perfect world, many of these same fans holler, Bucs offensive coordinator Liam Coen will be promoted to head coach. As the creator, curator and overall guru of Pro Football Talk, the great Mike Florio likes to say, silence invites speculation. And per a nugget from NFL Network insider Ian Rapoport, there may be a shakeup coming to the Bucs’ defensive staff. Rapoport reports Bucs defensive line coach Kacy Rodgers is interviewing with the Packers for the same coaching position. Well, why on earth would he move from Tampa to Green Bay for a lateral position? Could it be that Bowles is shaking up his defensive staff? Perhaps. Rapoport notes Rodgers’ contract is up with the Bucs. Rodgers has been a Bowles’ coaching brother-in-arms for years dating back to when the two worked for Bill Parcells in Dallas. He even called plays for the Jets defense was Bowles was head coach. So for Rodgers to up and leave for the same position — going from Tampa to Green Bay (in the dead of winter) suggests Rodgers knows he’s not safe with the Bucs. Joe likes Rodgers a lot despite how Joe has been harsh on him and the rest of the Bucs defensive staff’s inability to develop a drafted edge rusher. Rodgers has done a wonderful job working with defensive tackles. This season and last, the Bucs were the fourth-worst team in passing yards allowed per game. Four of those 2023 teams in the bottom five of this category either have new head coaches or new defensive coordinators. The Bucs have stood pat. Well, maybe until now.|2025-01-21 10:12:00|320|39|5|Kacy Rodgers|Bucs defensive shakeup rumors and potential departure speculation.|4|Mixed feelings on defensive coaches, uncertainty about departures, potential optimism for future changes.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""AL121976"", ""post"": ""I\u2019m ok w him leaving but Coen is going to break my heart if he leaves"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""21st,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""10:17"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Tye"", ""post"": ""The defense was bottom in the league so their coaching staff resume reflects that..

The radio play-by-play voice of the Jaguars, Frank Frangie, who also is a longtime afternoon sports radio voice in Jacksonville, was very clear that he believes Bucs offensive coordinator Liam Coen was the Jaguars’ No. 2 choice for head coach after former Lions coordinator Ben Johnson, who will be the Bears new head coach. Frangie made the comments Friday on the air, 1010 XL sports radio in Jacksonvile. “What I hear is they really like Liam Coen, like not like him, but really like him,” Frangie said. “That he did really well in his interview a couple of nights ago. It was an 8:30 p.m. interview. And if it’s not Ben Johnson, it’s Liam Coen.” Ouch. Again, Frangie works for the team and yesterday he further explained he was told Coen, along with Johnson and Aaron Glenn, “wowed” the team and “jumped off the page” compared to other candidates. Frangie noted how collectively he has been a huge fan of the Jaguars’ other head coach candidates (they had 10 first interviews), especially Ravens playcaller Todd Monken. Frangie said Monken is a personal friend but he’s hearing Coen is the guy who impressed most after Johnson. Even more troubling for Bucs fans afraid of losing Coen, Frangie made these comments during a conversation with CBS Sports insider Prickly Pete Prisco. Prisco lives in the Jacksonville area (unless he moved) and has intimate knowledge of the team. Prisco said he believed the Jaguars’ order of head coach picks is Johnson followed by Coen and then Glenn, the Lions defensive coordinator allegedly being targeted by the Jets. “I would not be surprised if the Jaguars have them ranked the same way,” Frangie replied. Team Glazer still has time to offer Coen a mountain of money to cancel his second interview with the Jaguars, so Joe isn’t shaking yet. Frangie wasn’t being a total Jaguars homer. Yesterday, he said he has no faith that Coen and the other first-time head coaches the Jags have been studying will be good at the job.|2025-01-21 10:00:00|361|78|4|Coen|Jags favor Liam Coen as potential head coach.|3|Mixed sentiments regarding Coen's potential departure and Bowles' future with the team.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Tye"", ""post"": ""I imagine Coen would jump at the chance to separate himself from a bum of a coach as Bowels\u2026.."", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""21st,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""10:05"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Couch Fan"", ""post"": ""I think Coen was an upgrade over Canales but I am still torn whether he is good or the exceptional talent we have on offense makes anyone look competent.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/sneaky-priority/|Sneaky Priority|Joe isn’t a big believer in spending money you don’t have to spend. Joe figures a lot of fans may want the Bucs to extend right tackle Luke Goedeke’s contract. He’s entering the final year of his current contract in 2025. Goedeke has been a helluva story. At left guard as a rookie he was awful. He flipped to right tackle the next season and was solid. This year? He was damn good. The Sage of Tampa Bay sports, Ira Kaufman, believes Goedeke is one of the better right tackles in the game. Jenna Laine of ESPN seems to agree. That’s why she thinks Goedeke should be extended this offseason. Under-the-radar offseason priority: Re-sign right tackle Luke Goedeke. He has one year left on his rookie contract. But given the jump he made in his second year starting at the position with an 89.5% pass block win rate, the Bucs are going to want to lock him up with a new long-term deal early. Again, Joe’s not a big believer in spending cash unnecessarily. Of course, Goedeke is important, but let’s say he has an off year in 2025 or even gets dinged up. Then the team is on the hook for major money when they could have had him at a better deal by being patient. The Bucs took their time with left tackle Tristan Wirfs and he’s one of the best players in the league. So it would not shock Joe if Licht took the patient approach with Goedeke as well. Besides, the money that the team might drop in Goedeke’s lap this year, couldn’t the Bucs use that Team Glazer loot to buy a corner or an inside linebacker?|2025-01-21 10:00:00|282|19|7|Luke Goedeke|Extend contract for promising right tackle; cautious spending advised.|4|Mixed sentiments with concerns about concussions and the importance of being patient with contracts.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""stpetebucsfan"", ""post"": ""Agree completely with JJoe on this one.

Look at the name of this here website. Of course Joe hopes Bucs offensive coordinator Liam Coen stays, even though “this Joe” predicted he would be a head coach somewhere in 2025. With Ben Johnson taking the Bears job (Godspeed), that left an opening for Coen with the Jags, who are setting up a second interview with him. If the Jags are smart, they may just hire Coen. And that is where Bucs fans may hold the winning hand. Do you really think Jags owner Shad Khan is going to do the smart thing? Khan is about as inept of an NFL owner as Joe has seen since Bill Bidwill. Say what you will about Hugh Culverhouse, but Joe actually remembers the Bucs in the 1979 NFC title game with Culverhouse as owner. Bidwill, the late owner of the Cardinals, never saw his team win more than one playoff game in a postseason (1998). More often than not, the Cardinals under Bidwill were a total joke, moving from town to town but the stench of losing followed Bidwill wherever he put down stakes. From 1949 through 1997, the Cardinals had zero playoff wins. Talk about lost decades! After Bidwill handed control of the team to his son Michael, only then did the Cardinals ever win anything. Khan is just about as bad, including his two games in London each season stunt. Awful. This is the same guy who hired Urban Meyer to develop Trevor Lawrence. Think about how moronic that was. Meyer was and is an option guy. He had Joe Burrow at Ohio State and actually believed Dwayne Haskins was a better quarterback. Can you imagine? Then Khan brings in the notorious Trent Baalke to run his team. Not only is Baalke a grossly overrated talent evaluator, but Baalke is reviled throughout the NFL. He’s about as blacklisted as they get. Many coaching candidates, if you believe some suits, refuse to interview with Khan because of Baalke. And Khan recently said unless someone points out to him why Baalke shouldn’t be the general manager, he’s safe. And folks really expect the Jags to ace this coaching search? That’s why Joe has faith Coen will return to the Bucs (unless John Spytek ends up working with Tom Brady in Las Vegas). Joe doesn’t believe Khan has a clue, thus he won’t select Coen. Unless you believe a broken clock is right twice a day and Khan accidently chooses Coen.|2025-01-21 04:00:00|417|44|3|Liam Coen|Joe doubts Jags owner will hire Coen.|2|Mixed sentiments about Bowles and Coen, with some criticism and concern expressed.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Defense Rules"", ""post"": ""There\u2019s a good chance IMO that this is all \u2018Much ado about nothing\u2019.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/tykee-smith-ready-to-take-over-in-2025/|Tykee Smith Ready To Take Over In 2025|Yeah, the Bucs had a decent season. Winning a division is good. Blowing chunks in the one and only playoff game is bad. Still, many, many teams only wished they were as bad as the Bucs. Small consolation, but still, it ain’t The Lost Decade, that’s for sure. The Bucs likely don’t win the NFC South if not for the play of rookies. In the spirit of new stars rising to the surface and making plays, Bradley Locker of the PFF tribe decided to predict a breakout player for the Bucs in 2025. Locker thinks that player will be defensive back Tykee Smith. General manager Jason Licht’s 2024 draft class already has a proven star in Bucky Irving, and Smith is another candidate to flourish. In his first NFL regular season… his 21 stops tied for the 13th most among rookies. The Bucs have been one of the NFL’s premier organizations in terms of drafting and developing talent, and Smith seems to be another prime example. Impressive numbers, especially for a guy who missed four games and late in the season looked every bit the player who slammed into the rookie wall. Smith only played in five (regular season) games the last two months of the season. He racked up nine tackles in the overtime loss at Kansas City and never had more than three in a game the rest of the season. If Smith can stay a little healthier and this offseason can start a workout regimen that helps him navigate a 17-game schedule, he could really be a stud.|2025-01-21 03:45:00|261|28|7|Tykee Smith|Tykee Smith poised for breakout season in 2025.|5|Mixed sentiments about team performance, coaching, and player development.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Aqualung"", ""post"": ""Is he taking over the pass defense coordinator role?"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""21st,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""3:54"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Hodad"", ""post"": ""The loss in the playoffs was only the last gut punch of the season.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/todd-bowles-didnt-like-the-vibe/|Todd Bowles Didn’t Like The Vibe|Bucs coach Todd Bowles has taken an absolute beating in the wake of losing to the Commandos last week. And that really hasn’t let up since the Commandos on Saturday thrashed the Lions, a team rendered somewhat toothless on defense with all of their injuries (not unlike the Bucs). One decision that has enraged many Bucs fans is the Bucs’ poor defense unable to get off the field when the Commandos had the ball. Bowles kicked a game-tying field goal late and trusted an untrustworthy defense to get the team to overtime. Last week, Bowles explained in detail why he chose the safe route and tied the game. Bowles simply did not like the vibe he got from the offense. In short, Bowles didn’t trust it to get a first down, or score points. “We go backwards,” Bowles began during his final media availability of the 2024 season. “It was fourth-and-3. We shot ourselves in the foot a few times on that drive, so it was easier to tie the ballgame in that [situation]. “If we were moving the ball at ease and getting down there every single time, we probably would’ve went for it. At the time when we were going for it, we had it third-and-1 and we thought we had two downs to get 1 yard. We didn’t get it, we went backwards. “If we didn’t get it, it was 20-17 and we possibly lose the ballgame, so at least we had the tie and try to get the defense to get the ball back.” So in essence, Bowles didn’t want to come up empty, turn the ball over on downs and help seal a defeat. Joe gets why fans are angry. Even if the offense was sputtering, it was still one of the better offenses in football and it had playmakers. The defense didn’t have nearly enough playmakers to force overtime. The Bucs defense is so thin (pray Lavonte David doesn’t retire) that Bucs AC/DC-loving general manager Jason Licht may even want to explore trading down to stockpile draft picks. The Bucs need a lot of bodies on defense, so many that Licht might have to break out the Team Glazer AmEx Black Card and buy some.|2025-01-21 00:00:00|371|53|4|Todd Bowles|Bowles didn't trust offensive vibe|3|Mixed sentiments towards coach Bowles, need for improvement in team strategy.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Aqualung"", ""post"": ""What a winner!
