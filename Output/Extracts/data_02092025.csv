https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/jon-gruden-o-line-coach-is-more-important-than-playcaller/|Jon Gruden: O-Line Coach Is More Important Than Playcaller|Bucs head coach Todd Bowles delivered one of the all-time great lines nearly two years ago following the decision to retain his offensive line coaches seven weeks after finishing last in the NFL in yards per carry. “They were worth salvaging,” Bowles said, after noting that Harold Goodwin and Joe Gilbert might have been replaced if he could have found better. It was a stunningly weak endorsement. A year later, the Bucs again had the worst yards-per-carry in the NFL. Gilbert and Goodwin left for Carolina with Dave Canales and in came their replacements, Kevin Carberry and Brian Picucci. Suddenly, the Bucs could run the ball and became a dominant rushing team. If you listen to Bucs Super Bowl-winning head coach Jon Gruden, Carberry and Picucci were critical cogs. “That position, I don’t care who calls the plays,” Gruden ranted on Barstool Sports last week. “You can bring Bill Walsh back; Joe Gibbs could walk in here. The offensive line coach is the most important hire you’re going to make as a head coach.” Joe might call that a hot take by Chucky, but he was so passionate about it, and one could argue the best offensive line coaches are represented in today’s Eagles-Chiefs Super Bowl. Joe suspects Buccaneers Ring of Honor general manager Jason Licht might agree with Gruden to a degree. There’s massive respect for Carberry and Picucci at One Buc Palace. And that was made evident last week. Picucci was promoted to offensive line coach from “assistant” O-line coach, and Carberry added run game coordinator to his title of offensive line coach. The Bucs had those guys under contract and didn’t have to serve up a promotion that surely came with extra Team Glazer loot.

His teammate gave candid insight. “He’s top of the food chain, so he gets to help with the decisions and stuff,” Tristan Wirfs told WDAE radio. The comment was in reference to his starting quarterback having a hand in picking his offensive coordinator. Wirfs’ comment came when he was relaying the story about how offensive linemen and Mayfield were vacationing when “El Serpiente,” Liam Coen, decided to stay in Tampa as offensive coordinator — and then decided to slither off to Jacksonville hours later hours later. Wirfs strongly implied that Mayfield was upset by what transpired, and he noted Mayfield was busy in talks with with the decision-makers at One Buc Palace and has now had nine offensive coordinators. Joe’s glad to hear Mayfield is being treated as “the man” at One Buc. His stature and influence surely will grow if he continues to play at an elite level.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/the-licht-house-is-getting-old/|The Licht House Is Getting “Old”|Is The Licht House showing its age? Well, it may be old by NFL standards. This surprised Joe. In A BSPN feature about the oldest stadiums in the league, the Bucs were said to have 11th-oldest stadium. It seems like yesterday the place just opened (1998) and fans cried that the cannons were too loud (can you imagine?). Joe brings this up because every stadium older than The Licht House has its home team either trying to obtain funding to replace its stadium or firm plans to replace its stadium, or construction of a new stadium is underway. Or, their home fields have recently been redesigned. Here are the oldest NFL stadiums compiled by Alex Kennedy: Bears, Soldier Field: Actively seeking funding to build a new stadium. Packers, Lambeau Field: Maybe the crown jewel of the NFL. It’s not going anywhere. Seems like once every eight years the Packers sell (worthless) stock and raise cash to modernized Lambeau. A shrine to the NFL. Chiefs, Arrowhead Stadium: The Chiefs are pursuing funding. A proposed possible site for a new stadium is some 24 miles away from Arrowhead Stadium across state lines in Kansas. The State of Kansas has a preliminary plan for funding in place. Bills, Highmark Stadium: Construction of a new stadium is scheduled to be completed for the 2026 season. Slimy Saints, Superdome: This place gets gutted and refitted every four or five years, it seems. Updated enough that Lincoln’s Tomb still gets big-time events like the Super Bowl and the Final Four. Dolphins, Joe Robbie Stadium: Totally renovated in 2016. Among other perks, it now has a roof covering the seats. Sweet! Jags, Gator Bowl: Financing was approved for a renovation of the old Gator Bowl last summer. Among the new features will be a translucent canopy — not an enclosed roof — very much like the Rams’ stadium. Stinking Panthers, Bank of America Stadium: Stinking Panthers strongman David Tepper obtained funding last year to gut its crib and redesign it. Commandos, FedEx Field: The Commandos are in the early stages of obtaining control of the old RFK Stadium site in the district to build a new crib. Commandos owner Josh Harris has targeted 2030 for the opening. Crows, M&T Bank Stadium: The Crows obtained some $430 million in state funding a little over a year ago for a series of projects that will “enhance” the stadium. The “projects” are scheduled to be completed for the 2027 season. Bucs, The Licht House: Crickets. Browns, Huntington Bank Field: The Browns announced a dome stadium project near the Cleveland airport. Since, the City of Cleveland has sued the Browns for violating Ohio’s Art Modell Law, which prohibits the Browns from moving outside city limits without first putting the team up for sale. So, construction is on hold. Titans, Nissan Stadium: New dome is scheduled to open for the 2027 season. So those are the 13 oldest stadiums in the NFL. All are as old or older than The Licht House (aside from the Packers) and either have new stadiums about to open, firm plans to renovate, recently upgraded facilities or are actively pursuing financing for a new stadium and/or renovation. Only the Bucs have been quiet about their plans. Then again, they usually are quiet about plans. That’s nothing new. Keep in mind the team was one of the last in the league to upgrade the replay boards from analog to digital. So the pace of change to The Licht House in the past has been slow. Therefore, it wouldn’t shock Joe if an upgrade/new stadium is some ways away. Since the race to build/rebuild/renovate stadiums is underway with so many stadiums, it doesn’t appear the Bucs will get another Super Bowl anytime soon, short of a large-scale modernization or redesign of The Licht House.  Joe wonders what Team Glazer has in the works regarding The Licht House. In the NFL, if teams aren’t keeping up with the Joneses (including Jerry Jones), they’re often left out in the cold.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/possible-cap-casualties-in-the-secondary/|Possible Cap Casualties In The Secondary|A month from Wednesday the NFL free agency dinner bell rings. NFL suits will be free to sign anyone available to be had (of course, legal tampering launches a month from tomorrow. And in about two weeks, illegal tampering ramps up at the combine). Joe has one guy in mind when it comes to a salary cap casualty. It’s not that Joe wants the guy launched, but unless he works his contract so that the bulk of his salary is tied to games played, Joe would be willing to walk away. And that guy is Jamel Dean. Look, Joe doesn’t hate Dean. In fact, Joe thinks he’s a better corner than most fans think. But gosh darn, he has to stay on the field. Dean has become so injury-prone he is on the edge of becoming a liability. Dean has either missed or could not finish three of the past four Bucs’ playoff games due to injuries. If a guy can’t stay on the field in the team’s most important games, what’s the point? Per Spotrac.com, Dean’s contract runs through 2026 but there is an escape clause this offseason. Dean is scheduled to make $13 million this year but there is a cap hit of only $6.85 million this offseason if the Bucs get rid of him. Dean has never played a full season and this season missed five games, the most of his career. He will turn 29 in October and dudes who push 30 don’t get healthier. In fact, it takes them longer to bounce back from injuries, which could be why Dean missed five games and also bowed out of the playoff loss to Washington. Dean may not be the only defensive back to be a salary cap victim. Logan Urlich of NFLTradeRumors.com seems to think safety Jordan Whitehead is on thin ice. In 2025, Whitehead enters the final year of his contract. Whitehead, again per Spotrac.com, if he stays, is due $4.5 million. That also is the cap hit the Bucs would take if they release him. Though he showed toughness coming back from a pec injury, Whitehead was a big disappointment. Joe saw too many loafs. Not all the time, but a handful is far too many. Joe believes that if you gave truth serum to Bucs coaches, they would confess to buyer’s remorse with Whitehead. A year ago, the Bucs thought they were getting the same guy back who shined in the Bucs’ 2020 Super Bowl season. So Whitehead costs the Bucs $4.5 million in cap room. May as well keep him unless you have someone else ready to sign who could provide better play. Based on Spotrac, it seems Dean is in more danger than Whitehead.|2025-02-09 08:00:00|453|22|4|Jamel Dean|Potential cap casualties in secondary due to injuries and performance.|3|Mixed sentiments on keeping or releasing players, with some advocating for draft picks and free agents.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""E N"", ""post"": ""I would keep Whitehead on the roster, if a draft pick beats him out, we still have great depth in case of injuries."", ""post_time"": [""February"", ""9th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""8:25"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Pickgrin"", ""post"": ""No offense Joseph \u2013 but you apparently need a tutorial on how to read a spotrac chart\u2026."", ""post_time"": [""February"", ""9th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""8:30"", ""am""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""rrsrq"", ""post"": ""What would it take to bring in Chavarius Ward, he has already stated he will not return to SanFran.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/tristan-wirfs-still-seems-slightly-surprised-he-was-named-all-pro/|Tristan Wirfs Still Seems Slightly Surprised He Was Named All-Pro|If there is one thing that goes down in NFL history for the Bucs in 2024, Joe can assure you that the team’s legacy will not be the signing of Randy Gregory. No, it will be how Bucs left tackle Tristan Wirfs became the very first NFL player to be named “All-Pro” at both right tackle and left tackle. Different seasons, of course. Not only did Wirfs still seem surprised last week that he was named All-Pro, how he learned of winning the award also seemed to surprise him. Pleasantly so. Wirfs was on radio row at the Super Bowl in New Orleans and did a spot with Ari Meirov of The 33rd Team. There, Meirov asked Wirfs about the All-Pro honor and how he learned of it. For background, Rob Maaddi of the Associated Press had a sitdown with Wirfs at One Buc Palace. There, Maddi had a secret for Wirfs. “Jordan Mailata had a really great year,” Wirfs told Meirov. “It’s going to be a toss-up.” Then, Maaddi unveiled his elaborate news. “They brought me in there to talk about the run game,” Wirfs recounted. “I was wearing Crocs. They asked me if I wanted to change and I said, ‘Naw, I’m fine.’ “So they brought them out and it was pretty special. That was really cool.” Who was “them?” Wirfs’ girlfriend Meredith Sutton and Wirfs’ baby son Julius walked in unannounced into the interview and Wirfs’ son had a shirt that read, “My Daddy is an All-Pro.” “This Joe” will be the very first person to raise a hand thinking the Bucs were playing with fire moving Wirfs from right tackle to left. There’s a reason no one has been an All-Pro at both left and right tackle. Wirfs was absolutely dominant at right tackle. So Joe didn’t want to tinker with something that wasn’t remotely broken. Leave well enough alone, but the Bucs moved him anyway. And it has turned out to be one of their best moves. Joe could argue that aside from Mike Evans, Wirfs is the best player on the Bucs’ roster. And that’s no slap at guys like Vita Vea or Calijah Kancey or Antoine Winfield or Lavonte David. Wirfs is just that damn good.
