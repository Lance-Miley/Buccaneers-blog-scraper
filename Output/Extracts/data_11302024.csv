https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/11/big-game-for-cade-otton-coming-today/|Big Game For Cade Otton Coming Sunday?|Since Mike Evans and Chris Godwin both got hurt in a terrible loss to Baltimore, one guy on the Bucs offense has really stepped up his game to become one of the better players at his position. That would be Bucs tight end Cade Otton. Now last week in New Jersey, Otton didn’t go crazy. He had three catches for 30 yards, not a bad average for a tight end. However, per the PFF tribe, Otton may just blow up Sunday in Charlotte. It seems the Stinking Panthers are one of the worst teams defending tight ends. After last week’s games, Otton was eighth among in the NFL tight ends with 486 yards receiving. The Stinking Panthers? The PFF tribe claims they rank 31st in allowing yards from tight ends. So yeah, Joe could see the Bucs and Baker Mayfield targeting Otton. But Joe thinks the Bucs will pound the ball on the ground. If that happens, Joe isn’t sure how many targets Otton will get.|2024-11-30 20:45:00|166|10|6|Cade Otton|Bucs tight end Cade Otton's upcoming game analysis.|8|Fans are hopeful, especially for Otton, Evans, and the tight ends, with some concerns.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Fred"", ""post"": ""Otton is the real thing.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/11/bucs-get-a-break/|Bucs Get A Break|The Joe typing this here post has been very vocal and upfront expressing doubt that the Bucs could run the table after the bye, going 7-0 and perhaps locking up the NFC South title. In fact, the same Joe figured the Bucs very likely would lose to the Chargers in four weeks, a game to be played in the City of Angels. Well, that game doesn’t look as tough now. Today, the Chargers announced they will place their best running back, J.K. Dobbins, on injured reserve. This means he will miss a minimum of four games. That includes Dec. 15 against the Bucs. Monday night’s game between the Crows and the Chargers was a good, close game until Dobbins injured his knee and left the game. The Chargers offense totally changed after that injury. Granted, the Chargers have a few weeks to regain their identity without Dobbins. But Joe is glad the Bucs won’t face one of Los Angeles’ best weapons. Maybe Lady Luck is smiling upon the Bucs?|2024-11-30 18:00:00|169|17|7|Bucs|Bucs may have favorable matchup due to Chargers' injury.|4|Mixed sentiments on the impact of changes in team dynamics, focusing on upcoming games.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Woodenman"", ""post"": ""Changes nothing Joe they have petty good back in Gus Edward\u2019s.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/11/joe-tryon-shoyinka-will-break-streak-of-62-games-played/|Joe Tryon-Shoyinka Will Break Streak Of 62 Consecutive Games|Joe would be remiss to overlook a Tampa Bay ironman missing his first career game tomorrow. Outside linebacker Joe Tryon-Shoyinka (sorry, Joe can’t call JTS an edge rusher) was the Bucs’ first-round draft pick in 2021, and the dude has never missed a game. It’s been a run of 62 regular season games (2,415 snaps) and 5 postseason contests. That’s a lot of football and a testament to how well JTS takes care of his body, but that run will end because of an ankle injury last Sunday in New Jersey. Tryon-Shoyinka has started all 11 games this season, but Joe suspects there won’t be any Bucs fans worried about losing his services tomorrow. This has been the least productive season for JTS and he’s probably better than Anthony Nelson, who is sure to start in his place. The Bucs didn’t put Tryon-Shoyinka on injured reserve, so Joe expects him back within a few weeks.

In looking at the 2024 draft class, Diamond picked the top 14 players he believes are steals. Diamond believes Irving is the fifth-best steal this past spring. Irving is a definite steal as a fourth-round pick and as the sixth running back taken. … Irving leads all rookie backs with 831 combined yards (579 rushing yards to rank second among rookies and 252 yards on 32 catches). He has scored five touchdowns to help the Bucs remain in contention for the NFC South title or a wild card spot. He shows great moves and the ability to evade tacklers with his balance and acceleration. Joe understands why the Sage of Tampa Bay Sports, Ira Kaufman, along with many Bucs fans, are frustrated Irving isn’t the Bucs’ starting running back. Understandable. He produces. Now whether Bucs offensive coordinator Liam Coen will have Irving backing up struggling running back Rachaad White tomorrow is unknown. However, the results cannot be argued. Irving and the Bucs offense are getting the job done. In a way, it is a good thing Irving isn’t getting more carries. He’ll be fresher for all the must-win games the Bucs have the next six weeks. |2024-11-30 10:13:00|233|24|8|Bucky Irving|Bucky Irving named one of biggest draft steals.|6|Mixed sentiments with some enthusiasm for players like Bucky, but also some frustration expressed.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Stanglassman"", ""post"": ""\u201cIra Kaufman, along with many Bucs fans, are frustrated that Irving isn\u2019t the Bucs\u2019 starting quarterback. \u201c Huh?"", ""post_time"": [""November"", ""30th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""10:06"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""SB"", ""post"": ""LOL as the 125th pick I believe he IS THE steal of the draft."", ""post_time"": [""November"", ""30th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""10:19"", ""am""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""JimBobBuc"", ""post"": ""On the list above, Bucky was the lowest pick at 125, and is 5th best in the list!

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/11/homegrown-and-healthy/|Homegrown And Healthy|The excuses have run out for the Bucs defense.  Sure, the defense played well against a JV Giants offense on Sunday, but that’s no accomplishment. Tomorrow against the Panthers, the opposing offense will be more legitimate — a decent offensive line, an established running back and a quarterback better than a third-stringer named Tommy DeVito. So the Bucs will have to prove themselves, albeit against a very poor offense overall. The Panthers have limited weapons — they traded top receiver Diontae Johnson — and now their top tight end is injured. But they do have veteran receivers in old man Adam Thielen (11 catches) and David Moore (19 catches). Those guys can find space in soft zone coverage, if the Bucs choose to continue the play-to-lose defense that’s hurt the team so badly this season. Rookie reciever Xavier Legette leads the Panthers with 33 catches but he’s still a very raw prospect. Joe sees a Bucs defense starting tomorrow that will be 100 percent homegrown and pretty darn healthy for December of an NFL season. Calijah Kancey, Vita Vea, Anthony Nelson and YaYa Diaby are likely to start on the Bucs’ defensive front. Linebackers Lavonte David and K.J. Britt will be behind them, and the Todd Bowles-crafted secondary will have Nos. 1 and Nos. 2 cornerbacks Jamel Dean and Zyon McCollom on the field with star safety Antoine Winfield, Mike Edwards and Christian Izien likely at safety/nickel with them. More draft picks like Logan Hall and Joe Tryon-Shoyinka (if healthy) will get plenty of snaps. That’s a healthy, experienced and completely homegrown bunch Bowles has molded. So few NFL teams can say that. No room tomorrow for excuses like communication or injuries. That group is good enough to be average, which should be more than enough to support a strong Bucs offense. In fact, average defense should be all that’s required to beat the sad Panthers (twice), Raiders, Saints and Cowboys, five of the six teams remaining on the Bucs’ schedule. If Todd Bowles can’t deliver average defense consistently with this group, then Joe’s going to wave a white flag.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/11/bucky-irving-in-elite-company/|Bucky Irving In Elite Company|BY IRA KAUFMAN Jayden Daniels or Bo Nix. Bo Nix or Jayden Daniels. Everyone can identify the twin favorites to win NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year honors. Nix and Daniels are playing well under center for winning teams. That goes a long way with the 50 Associated Press voters who will turn in their ballots within a few days of the end of the regular season. As a long-time AP voter, I’m impressed with how the Broncos and Commanders are faring with rookie quarterbacks. Daniels appeared to be the clear Rookie of the Year favorite until Nix raised his game for a 7-5 Broncos team that has rebounded nicely from an 0-2 start. In Tampa, there’s a dynamic fourth-round draft pick who is coming off his best pro game. Whether he’s dodging a couple of defenders at the line of scrimmage or making cornerbacks looks silly after a reception, Bucky Irving appears poised to lead the Bucs on another late-season surge to the playoffs. Don’t expect the 125th pick in the draft to vault ahead of Daniels or Nix for rookie honors. That’s not going to happen. He’s not a quarterback, yet Irving provides weekly juice for one of the league’s elite offenses. Liam Coen has brought Irving along slowly — until now. It’s crunch time. With six games remaining, the 5-6 Bucs have little margin for error. Irving received a season-high 18 touches against the Giants, generating 151 yards from scrimmage on only 34 snaps. Heading into Carolina, Irving’s workload should only increase in the stretch run. Why? He deserves it. You go with your best players and at the moment, Bucky Irving is one of Tampa Bay’s best players. He’s averaging 5.9 yards on his 140 touches this season. The only backs with more touches and a better average are Derrick Henry (6.2), Jahmyr Gibbs (6.4) and Saquon Barkley (6.6). How’s that for company?  Irving is providing a weekly highlight reel with his sharp jump cuts and field vision. He rarely runs in a straight line and he leads all rookie backs in rushing yards and touchdowns. The kid can catch, too. Irving has latched onto 32 of the 34 passes Baker Mayfield has sent his way. That 94.1 percent success rate is No. 1 in the league. No wonder Irving has rapidly gained the confidence of Mayfield, Todd Bowles and the Glazers. Jason Licht might have whiffed on pass rushers in recent drafts, but he hit a home run with Irving. The former Oregon standout is soft-spoken. He prefers to do his talking on the field and right now, you can’t shut him up. Irving played two years for the Ducks with Nix and despite Oregon’s success, some NFL scouts were concerned about Irving 5-foot-9 frame and his 4.55 clocking at the Combine. When Irving lasted until the third day of the draft, the Bucs pounced. While Rachaad White has value as a pass-catching back who can block, it’s become clear that Irving is the more gifted runner. Bowles isn’t easily impressed, especially with rookies, but Irving has captivated his head coach with his work ethic and natural skills. It’s exciting to think about what No. 7 can do with more touches. We’re about to find out.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/11/espn-prediction-bucs-will-bludgeon-stinking-panthers-on-the-ground/|ESPN Prediction: Bucs Will Bludgeon Stinking Panthers On The Ground|Even without All-Pro tackle Tristan Wirfs, the Bucs’ offensive line seems to get better and better by the week, both pass and run blocking. Last week the Bucs faced a garbage team that nonetheless has exceptional pass rushers. Baker Mayfield didn’t get sacked and was only hit twice. Meanwhile, the Bucs on the ground racked up 156 yards rushing and a hair under five yards a clip. As Jenna Laine of ESPN points out, what the Bucs rushed for last Sunday is just about the average rushing yards the Stinking Panthers allow per game. The Panthers’ defense allows a league-worst 160.6 rushing yards per game, while the Bucs’ 128.1 rushing yards per game is 10th in the league after they ranked last in 2023. So this is easy for Joe to figure out: The Bucs always want to run the ball. The Bucs don’t want to get future Hall of Fame receiver Mike Evans hurt (again). Joe can see this playing out tomorrow: The Bucs are going to run, run and run some more until the Stinking Panthers are willing to call right tackle Luke Goedeke “Daddy.”|2024-11-30 08:00:00|187|13|8|Bucs|Bucs expected to dominate Panthers on the ground.|4|Mixed sentiment with cautious optimism and skepticism about winning.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Bojim"", ""post"": ""Just don\u2019t try to shove White up the middle please."", ""post_time"": [""November"", ""30th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""8:24"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Razorramone"", ""post"": ""^^^^this."", ""post_time"": [""November"", ""30th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""8:38"", ""am""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""ThatAintRight!"", ""post"": ""As long as they show up with respect for their opponent then we will be fine.

And for Bucs fans outside the Tampa Bay TV market, it’s very unlikely they’ll see the game free via their local FOX affiliate unless they’re living in ACC country Save for the greater Nashville area, only folks in the southeast who value college basketball will get to see the game on the free airwaves. Everyone else, it’s off to the bar or Sunday Ticket. The preseason TV voice of the Bucs, Chris Myers, along with Mark Schlereth and Jen Hale, will have the call for the 4:05 p.m. kickoff.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/11/sacks-really-are-drive-killers-for-bucs-offense/|Sacks Really Are Drive Killers For Bucs Offense|This shouldn’t be an issue tomorrow. In the summer of 2023, handicapper turned stathead Warren Sharp documented how, over a five-year period, sacks absolutely destroyed offensive drives. The percentage of offensive drives that ended in touchdowns without a sack was dramatically higher than drives that resulted in a touchdown despite a sack. Simply put, if a defense can put a quarterback on the ground, the odds were great that drive either ended in a punt or perhaps a field goal attempt. And folks actually wonder why Joe is so obsessed with an edge rush. Can you imagine? Well, the Bucs offense is walking, living proof how a sack can completely eff up a drive. And yes, this intel comes from Sharp Football Analysis. Tampa Bay averages 3.06 points per drive on possessions without a sack (2nd in the NFL) compared to 0.55 points per drive with a sack (30th). Joe isn’t sweating this stat this week. The Stinking Panthers have a positively miserable pass rush. The Bucs, playing a team last week with three strong pass rushers, didn’t allow a sack all day as Baker Mayfield only got hit twice. Joe is expecting the Bucs to put up a bunch of points tomorrow.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/11/jordan-whitehead-placed-on-injured-reserve/|Jordan Whitehead Placed On Injured Reserve|So this much we know as a result of this transaction the Bucs made on the afternoon of Black Friday. Safety Jordan Whitehead was placed on injured reserve, which means he will miss at least four games. Whitehead blew out a pec muscle Sunday in New Jersey. It’s a very painful injury and pretty much renders a player with just one wing. MRI results came back and revealed Whitehead did not have a torn pec and thus would not need surgery. At the time, Whitehead was said to miss “some time” to heal enough to play. Talk about a friggin’ warrior! Joe asked Todd Bowles this week if he had a guesstimate how much time Whitehead would miss. Bowles didn’t know but believed it would be multiple games. Now we know. When a player goes on injured reserve, he must sit out a minimum of four games. So Whitehead won’t be eligible to return until the Bucs host the Stinking Panthers on Dec. 29, the second-last game of the regular season. And that’s only if he’s healthy.|2024-11-30 00:00:00|177|11|5|Jordan Whitehead|Whitehead placed on injured reserve|3|Mixed sentiments about player injuries, roster decisions, and team performance next season.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""A Bucs Fan"", ""post"": ""It\u2019s around a six week injury so yah makes sense."", ""post_time"": [""November"", ""30th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""2:48"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""heyjude"", ""post"": ""Wow, didn\u2019t see an IR coming.
