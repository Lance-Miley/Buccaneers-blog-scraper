https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/calijah-kancey-is-todd-bowles-new-swiss-army-knife/|Calijah Kancey Is Todd Bowles’ New Swiss Army Knife|In light of how Bucs coach Todd Bowles trumpeted the play of Calijah Kancey on Monday with WFLA-TV, Joe doesn’t know what to make of the following. The second-year defensive tackle from Pitt is coming into his own. The lightning-fast Kancey is really a handful. He and Vita Vea are a nasty one-two punch. Kancey is an incredible athlete. Joe doesn’t know how many Bucs fans have noticed but it’s not uncommon to see Kancey line up as an edge rusher. Hey, the way the Bucs don’t rush the passer from the edge, why not use Kancey out there? He’s quick enough and he’s already shown he knows what to do when he gets close enough to breathe on a quarterback. That’s not all. In Los Angeles last weekend, Bowles had Kancey drop back into pass coverage. Bowles’ explanation for this is very curious. “He’s more than willing,” Bowles said of Kancey’s approach to pretending to be Derrick Brooks. “He’s so athletic that he drops as good if not better than some of our linebackers.” Joe can take that comment all sorts of ways: For example, Kancey is just that good and it’s no shock he can cover dudes in pass defense. Or, Joe could take that as a Parcellian jab by Bowles to motivate YaYa Diaby and Joe Tryon-Shoyinka to start putting quarterbacks on the ground. Given Bowles’ many years working for Bill Parcells, Joe wouldn’t be shocked if Bowles was copying the master motivator. But don’t get too freaked by Bowles’ words. He has zero intention of turning Kancey into Lavonte David II. “Obviously, we don’t want him to make a living off [dropping back into pass coverage],” Bowles said. “We want him to rush the passer, but in a few instances and circumstances when we know they’re keying on him, that we can get him out of there and get somebody else free.” And that last sentence is the key. If offensive linemen are keying on Kancey, by him taking a few steps back, it’s liable to create a crease for a blitzing defensive back. In theory. This is one of many reasons why Joe is so irked by the wet-noodle edge rush. If the Bucs had an edge rush, then teams couldn’t key on Kancey (or Vea), and the entire offensive line of an opponent would then become a jailbreak.|2024-12-18 17:07:00|394|52|7|Calijah Kancey|Kancey excels in versatile defensive roles under Todd Bowles.|6|Mixed feelings about Coach Bowles' defensive strategies and player performance.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/thats-all-weve-been-focusing-on/|“That’s All We’ve Been Focusing On”|The 2024 Bucs defense has gone from real to fake and back to real again. The latest reincarnation was a second-half smothering of the Chargers and QB Justin Herbert on Sunday. Los Angeles didn’t convert a third or fourth down all game. The results seem to be coming from a fresh approach by Todd Bowles: ignore the opponent. “We saw before the bye week the things we were messing up as far as missing tackles, taking bad angles, not doing the little things right,” Bowles told the Buccaneers Radio Network. “And we really wanted to focus on that and we stopped focusing on the opponent. And we thought if we could focus on that part and just do that right, we had a chance to win some ballgames. “And we’ve cleaned a lot of that up. And it’s got to be week by week and it’s definitely got to be week-by-week and it’s definitely got to keep on going. But that’s all we’ve been focusing on.” Joe was intrigued to hear Bowles share these details. It represents one value of having defensive coordinator in his sixth season with the same team. Nearly every player knows the complex defense so darn well that Bowles can relentlessly drill fundamentals late in a season without worrying about it affecting game preparation.|2024-12-18 14:18:00|218|28|7|Todd Bowles|Bucs defense refocus brings success against Chargers.|3|Mixed sentiments with some positivity and hope balanced with skepticism and criticism.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Ds"", ""post"": ""Love when guys are flying around and Bowles goes back to being blitz happy"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""18th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""2:58"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Timbucs2"", ""post"": ""Joe, one of the biggest holes on the D is whoever is playing next to Lavonte (all three of them) in pass coverage.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/todd-bowles-insults-will-help-bucs/|Todd Bowles: Insults Will Help|It seems Todd Bowles has an interesting line item on his job description for assistant coaches. Joe’s not calling Bowles a sadist, but the head coach said he feels good about having coaches that can “insult” players when appropriate to help keep them grounded. Bowles was asked today by Tampa Free Press beat man Rock Riley about keeping his roster’s head right as they lead the NFC South and get love from across the NFL landscape. No worries. Bowles said, “We didn’t listen when we were losing and we’re not listening now that we’re winning. So that’s not going to be a big deal.” A method to the keeping players in check, just in case? Smack players with one-liners and wiseass comments. “We have enough sarcastic coaches and sarcastic players to insult people to keep everybody grounded so that we’re all ready to work,” Bowles said. So that’s not a problem at all. We get shots in all the time.” Hey, Joe hopes it works. It’s easy for some players to get caught up in the hype, which will hit record levels if the Bucs beat the Cowboys on Sunday Night Football in four short days. If Bowles runs out of insults, Joe would love to see Bucco Bruce Arians to be called in to practice to earn some of that Team Glazer loot he hauls in while golfing and drinking under the title of Senior Advisor to the General Manager.|2024-12-18 13:01:00|241|33|5|Todd Bowles|Bowles uses insults to keep players grounded and focused.|6|Mixed opinions on coaching methods, with hints of optimism and skepticism.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Billy Bucco"", ""post"": ""Whatever you are doing, keep it up!!

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/he-knows-he-cant-be-blocked-right-now/|“He Knows He Can’t Be Blocked Right Now”|Want to win playoff games? Have a stud quarterback and true playmakers on both sides of the ball. And the best long-range kicker in the history of the NFL is a bonus, too. The kicker is Chase McLaughlin, the Bucs’ big leg that Joe’s almost afraid to write about as not to jinx the franchise. Man, after a multiple shanks, Buccaneers Ring of Honor general manager Jason Licht has become the kicking scout of the decade. So what about those playmakers. Do the Bucs have them? The sure do. It’s a reason why Joe was unwilling to celebrate the Bucs’ near stumble against three-win Carolina two weeks ago. This team is too talented to have had that kind of performance in a must-win game. One playmaker is second-year defensive tackle Calijah Kancey, who got the ultimate compliment this week from head coach Todd Bowles. “It’s scary because he’s a very smart player,” Bowles said of Kancey via WFLA.com. “… He’s seeing everything. And he knows he can’t be blocked right now and he’s playing like that. And we love it.” Unblockable. Joe can’t think of higher praise, and Bowles isn’t one to toss out superlatives like Baker Mayfield throws interceptions. Which horse is going to put the defense on his back and take some of the load off Lavonte David?|2024-12-18 09:16:00|220|35|8|Calijah Kancey|Bucs' talented players shine in crucial matchups.|4|Mixed sentiments with concern about individual player performances and defensive consistency.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Buc in VA"", ""post"": ""It feels like we\u2019re climbing back on the high horse.

That’s what happens when you strut into the media capital west of the Mississippi River and chain-whip arguably the best defense in the NFL. Friend of Joe, Adam Schein, the popular national sports TV and radio personality of CBS and SiriusXM, took to his show “Schein on Sports” Monday and declared the Bucs’ curb-stomping of the Chargers the most monumental feat of the past NFL weekend. And there Schein made a passionate plea for the selectors of the Pro Football Hall of Fame to make Mike Evans a first-ballot nominee. Schein noted how any NFL fan who pays attention knows the impact the legendary Bucs receiver has had not just with the Bucs, but in the league. “He’s one of the best receivers in the history of the league,” Schein said of Evans. “You either get it or you don’t. … You either show respect or you don’t.” Schein said Evans’ name deserves to be mentioned in hushed tones by Bucs fans along with Warren Sapp, Derrick Brooks and Ronde Barber. (Joe would add Lee Roy Selmon to that list.) As for the Bucs, Schein added, “No team had a more impressive win … than the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. That was the performance of the weekend. The Bucs deserve that kind of credit and love.” Schein isn’t wrong.|2024-12-18 09:13:00|236|20|'8|Mike Evans|Adam Schein praises Mike Evans for Hall of Fame consideration.'|6|Mixed sentiments with hope for further success and recognition despite some critical comments.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""dls5492"", ""post"": ""The second TD pass to Evans was a work of art."", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""18th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""9:28"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""BigPoppaBuc"", ""post"": ""Could say the exact same thing for LVD\u2026 If you know you know.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/nfl-network-liam-coen-coach-of-the-week/|NFL Network: Liam Coen “Coach Of The Week”|Better get used to it, Bucs fans. In a couple of weeks, you’ll be reading how teams are asking the Bucs for permission to interview offensive coordinator Liam Coen for a head coaching job. Joe has been on Coen’s bandwagon for months. Joe understands how much owners want offensive head coaches. Offense sells. Some teams have a ton of money sunk into the offensive side of the ball. Good offensive-minded coaches almost always can get the most out of quarterbacks. Always remember and never forget: It’s always about the quarterback. Even when it’s not. With Baker Mayfield having success with Coen early and the Bucs offense rolling since the early weeks of the season, “this Joe” predicted Coen would be a head coach somewhere next year, either in the NFL or college. So closet Bucs fan Peter Schrager, co-host of “Good Morning Football,” seen weekdays on NFL Network, took to his show to knight Coen as his “Coach of the Week.” Coen did the unthinkable, apparently, he crafted a gameplan that hung 40 points on a defense that was averaging 15 points a game. “Liam Coen: Get to know his name well,” Schrager trumpeted to NFL fans. “It’s going to be popping up in a lot of head coaching conversations over the next several weeks.” The only way for this not to happen? Team Glazer can take a step forward and make a major move for their organization.|2024-12-18 09:00:00|238|26|8|Liam Coen|Coen receives high praise as potential head coaching candidate.|3|Mixed sentiments with some concerns about continuity and the potential departure of the coach.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Bojim"", ""post"": ""Promise him anything and pay him a lot.

Tampa Bay’s hammering of the Chargers was extra special on the hype front because it happened in Los Angeles, and Southern California is home to many media types. Blowhard Colin Cowherd, the former local Tampa Bay sports radio and TV guy, always seems to keep and extra eye on the Buccaneers from his national perch at FS1. He revealed his weekly power rankings yesterday and has the Bucs at No. 9 in the NFL. “I may have them low,” Cowherd said. “This is a weird team,” Cowherd said, noting the Bucs can win ugly and win via shootout. He also likes his perception that the Bucs can run the ball down an opponent’s throat but the opposition can’t return the favor.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/jalen-mcmillan-has-a-big-supporter-in-mike-evans/|Jalen McMillan Has A Big Supporter In Mike Evans|A little background on Mike Evans’ sharp eye for talent at receiver. Many a receiver in Evans’ shoes in the Bucs’ locker room Sunday, after his team just completed a landmark road against a quality team, would hog the spotlight. After all, Evans had just racked up 159 yards and 2 touchdowns. All sorts of receivers would milk that opportunity for self-promotion. But Evans isn’t like a lot of receivers and that’s one reason he’s special. Back in 2017, Chris Godwin’s rookie season, Godwin caught a bomb from America’s Quarterback, Jameis Winston, to beat the slimy Saints 31-24 on the final offensive play of the season for the Bucs. Joe talked to Evans in the Bucs locker room after that game and Evans said Godwin was a no-doubt-about-it No. 1 receiver. There was Evans, already clearly the Bucs’ best receiver, saying a rookie teammate was a No. 1 receiver. When Joe replied, “Mike, I thought you were a No. 1 receiver?” Evans shrugged his shoulders, smiled and said, “I am.” That’s Evans. Always humble. So Sunday after the Bucs borrowed a fungo bat from the Dodgers and used it to pummel the Chargers, Joe asked Evans about another rookie receiver, Jalen McMillan. After seven games of putting up goose eggs, McMillan has caught fire lately with three touchdowns in his last two games, including one against the Chargers for the Bucs’ first score. (The Bucs are 8-1 this year when scoring first, and winless when not.) Like Evans did when Godwin was a rookie, Evans raved about McMillan. “I’ve been telling everybody he’s going to be a really great player for us,” Evans said. “He started us off. Touchdown. Big third-down grabs all night. Great performance by him.” And that’s Evans. On a night when he should have been — and was — one of the focal points of a significant Bucs win, Evans made sure Joe and fans knew that McMillan will be a stud, too.|2024-12-18 01:58:00|327|22|9|Jalen McMillan|Evans praises McMillan's potential as a standout player.|8|Generally positive sentiment with a focus on team performance and leadership.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""adam from ny"", ""post"": ""mike propin\u2019 up his guy\u2026way to go\u2026!"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""18th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""2:11"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""adam from ny"", ""post"": ""joes:"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""18th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""2:50"", ""am""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""Danfan"", ""post"": ""We\u2019re a \u2018take what the opposing defence gives us\u2019 team, which is great.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/baker-mayfield-passing-chart-2/|Baker Mayfield Passing Chart|Now this is a cool chart. Joe apologizes for being redundant, but props to Bucs offensive coordinator Liam Coen. He is a consistent man. As with nearly every game this year, Coen frowns on throwing deep. He’s got a dink-and-dunk Bucs offense that is working to near perfection. Case in point is the 40-point bomb Coen and the Bucs offense dropped on arguably the best defense in the league. One could argue the offensive explosion was because Coen ordered Baker Mayfield to throw farther than 20 yards downfield. But that only happened four times. Three ended up as touchdowns! Joe is not a believer in coincidences in football, and that stat right there tells Joe that Coen had smartly lulled the Chargers into thinking the Bucs wouldn’t throw deep. Coen both surprised and caught the Chargers’ defensive backs with their pants down. Mike Evans told Joe in the locker room that he believed his 35-yard touchdown happened, in part, because the Chargers were not expecting a long pass. Boom! Six points! Mayfield’s passing chart from the win is below courtesy of NextGen Stats. It’s pretty cool. Might Coen unleash the hounds a little more as a result of what happened in Los Angeles on Sunday?

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/lavonte-david-is-a-gruden-grinder/|Lavonte David Is A “Gruden Grinder”|Joe for years has pounded his keyboard suggesting Bucs iconic linebacker Lavonte David is the most underrated player in the NFL. Year after year after year David produces at a level that even morons should recognize is one of the best, if not the best in the NFL at linebacker — yet David cannot sniff a Pro Bowl. It’s really criminal because Joe is confident David is having money stolen from him (salary bonus incentives). In the past, Even Mina Kimes of BSPN has noted how sinfully underrated David is. The guy just cannot get any run from people who are not X’s and O’s junkies. And it seems Chucky is getting tired of it as well. The man who first brought a Vince Lombardi Trophy to Tampa in January 2023 took to Twitter for his gig at Barstool Sports and offered up his “Gruden Grinders.” These are players who fly under the radar but have significant impact for their teams in the previous weekend. Chucky selected David as one of his “Gruden Grinders.” “The heart and soul of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers defense,” Chucky began. “And he has been doing it for years, Lavonte David.” Then Chucky inferred that just because the clowns on the hollering shows on BSPN and FS1 don’t mention David doesn’t mean he’s not a dominant player. “The man has been grinding forever down here in Tampa,” Chucky said. “He’s forced out 31 fumbles in his career. “I love Lavonte David.” If David can somehow get two more forced fumbles, that would tie him with Hall of Famers Reggie White and Charles Woodson with 33, good enough for 20th all-time (T.J. Watt and Tamba Hali also have 33). But Chucky is right. David has been balling out for a long, long time. Sad that so many either ignore him, choose to ignore him, or just flat out don’t know any better. But yeah, you national empty talking heads, keep on slurping and panting about how Kirk Cousins will lead the Dixie Chicks to the Super Bowl like you did non-stop all spring and summer.

The same way Mike Evans was until the last couple years. Maybe if enough people in the media start talking about him, then he will finally get his roses. But when your own Hall of Fame voter doesnt support a deserved player, you know you really have an uphill battle. Maybe Ira will come around if/when the national guys say its ok? Like Ira did for Evans too. I vividly remember Ira saying Mike Evans was a maybe just a few years back. Then once the national landscape changed and all the outlets started talking up Mike, then so suddenly did Ira. Ira, I love you man but you are kind of a frontrunner for these guys. Lavonte has the stats, consistency and demeanor to be a Hall of Famer.
