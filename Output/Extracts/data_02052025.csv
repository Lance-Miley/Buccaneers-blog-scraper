https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/367474/|Patience Will Pay Off For Mike Greenberg|BY IRA KAUFMAN Once again, Mike Greenberg proved he’s one of the smartest guys in the room. The brainy capologist of the Buccaneers checked the balance sheet and gave the Jaguars the back of his hand. Greenberg was one of Jacksonville’s top choices to replace Trent Baalke as General Manager, but he declined to interview and will return to One Buc Place as Jason Licht’s trusted consigliere. That’s a win for the Bucs and another example of Greenberg’s clarity of thought when it comes to tough decisions. While Greenberg pines for a GM job, he’s patient enough to wait for the right job. And Jacksonville, with rookie head coach Liam Coen, clueless owner Shad Khan and underachieving quarterback Trevor Lawrence, hardly offers a blueprint for success. “The most important thing when you get your chance, is for the owner, the GM and the coach to be on the same page.” says former NFL general manager Marty Hurney. “If you have that, you have a shot. If you don’t, it’s very difficult. Still, there’s only 32 of these GM jobs and it’s hard to turn one down because you always think you can make it work.” After 15 years in the Buc organization, Greenberg isn’t in a rush to move on. He’s very tight with Licht and ownership, but make no mistake — Greenberg aspires to run an NFL organization. John Spytek, another one of Licht’s assistant GMs, just took the GM job with the Raiders. With Tom Brady eager to flex his muscles in Las Vegas, Spytek might have a shot to succeed. He’d better. As a rule, it’s very difficult for NFL general managers to get a second opportunity. They are looked on as damaged goods, unable to use their experience to guide a different franchise. That’s not the case with head coaches, who are often recycled. There are currently eight head coaches — Raheem Morris, Sean Payton, Andy Reid, Pete Carroll, Jim Harbaugh, Mike Vrabel, Todd Bowles and Dan Quinn — with prior experience on the NFL sidelines. “GMs are judged far more on results that what coaches are,” says Hall of Fame executive Bill Polian. “You can name any number of coaches who have gotten second or in some cases third chances who really have nothing more than .500 records. GMs in that position really struggle to get a second chance.” Greenberg looked at the Jaguars and said “Pass.” A year from now, he might find a better fit with another franchise. While it’s not easy to tell an interested organization that you’re staying put, Greenberg realizes one wrong move can bury a GM. Look no further than Mark Dominik, replaced by Licht in 2014 after compiling a 28-52 record in Tampa. Dominik never got another job in the NFL. John Idzik never returned to the executive suite after being run out of New York as Jets GM. In Tim Ruskell’s first year as Seattle’s GM, the 2005 Seahawks made the Super Bowl, snapping a 21-year streak without a playoff win. The good times were fleeting. He was dismissed before the 2009 season concluded and is out of the NFL. The same fate awaited another former Director of Player Personnel for the Bucs. Ruston Webster was fired by the Titans after an 18-46 mark as GM. Most recently, he’s been working in Atlanta’s personnel department. History says you don’t get three strikes as an NFL GM. One strike and you’re out on your rump — with a compensation package to soothe a fractured ego. Greenberg made the right call. Jacksonville’s been an NFL cesspool and all of his salary-cap acumen can’t overcome a shoddy roster. “Teams are generally looking for fresh ideas and new energy when it comes to hiring a GM,” Hurney says. “Getting a second chance is definitely hard, but not impossible.” Greenberg can do better than the Jags. A year from now, he will. |2025-02-05 16:43:00|650|20|7|Mike Greenberg|Greenberg demonstrates patience in pursuit of GM opportunity.|6|Mixed opinions on potential promotions and job roles in Tampa Bay front office.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""BucsFanSince1996"", ""post"": ""I\u2019m glad Greenburg is here in Tampa for another year, but hope he gets a GM job next season.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/bucs-hire-charlie-strong-as-defensive-line-coach/|Bucs Hire Charlie Strong As Defensive Line Coach|Though his NFL resume is thin as one-ply toilet paper, former South Florida head coach Charlie Strong returns to the Tampa Bay area with some 40 years of defensive coaching experience. Ian Rapoport of NFL Network reports Strong will replace Kacy Rodgers as the Bucs’ defensive line coach. The long-time college coach spent just one season in the NFL serving as Urban Meyer’s linebackers coach in Jacksonville. And that’s not really something to brag about. Strong also was head coach at Louisville and Texas before coming to South Florida. He did spend six seasons earlier this century serving various responsibilities on Florida’s defensive staff including defensive coordinator. Strong was also on Nick Saban’s staff in Saban’s final year as coach at Alabama. So Strong has a lot of experience developing children into young adults on a football field. Experience working with professionals? Not so much. Rodgers was long-time associate of Bucs coach Todd Bowles dating back to their days with the Cowboys some 20 years ago. Rodgers left last month to take the same position with the Lions. Rodgers’ unit was the best-producing position group of the Bucs’ defense.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/not-much-work-to-do/|“Not Much Work To Do”|The Bucs’ pass defense was awful. Again. And one could argue (after a couple beers) that the pass defense is why Tampa Bay isn’t right now preparing to stop the Chiefs from three-peating. One guy who bounced around the NFL practice squad circuit after starting at guard for Notre Dame, Mike Golic, Jr., doesn’t believe the Bucs have a monumental task this offseason to find the pieces and make the tweaks needed to be one of the NFC’s elite. On Mina Kimes’ podcast, Golic said he trusts Bucs coach Todd Bowles to get the job done. “The good news is, you know, offensively, there’s not that much work to do,” Golic said. “And in the trenches, this is a team that’s like, built the right way. “I just feel like it won’t be that hard for them to improve.” Golic isn’t wrong. The offense should be fine. Joe can’t expect it to be top-five like it was last year but the Bucs don’t need a top-five offense if they play smarter football and their defense improves. Joe firmly believes rookies Graham Barton, Bucky Irving and Jalen McMillan will improve. As good as they are, if they improve, the offense will be just fine. It’s the pass defense, that could drag this team down — again. Of course, if the Bucs decide to be bold and go get Myles Garrett, problem solved.|2025-02-05 06:30:00|231|53|4|Mike Golic|Jr.|4|Mixed opinions on defense and coaching, potential need for improvements but some optimism.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Lt.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/nfl-com-bucs-must-find-an-edge-rusher/|NFL.com: Bucs Must Find An Edge Rusher|This ain’t coming from Joe. Instead, this comes straight from the fingertips of Kevin Patra of NFL.com. Patra has a pair of eyes, too. And like most reasonable people, he understands dominant teams are dominant because they have a stud edge rusher (or two). Joe believes that the Bucs are a beastly edge rusher away from making a Super Bowl run. That’s right. The best way to fix a bad pass defense is to have a guy in the grill of the opposing quarterback if not slamming him to the ground (when the zebras aren’t looking). So Patra highlighted the one thing each NFC team needs to resolve this offseason. Yesterday, Patra made no bones about it: The Bucs must find an edge rusher, or they will likely be watching the Super Bowl on TV next year—from their couches or from a beach bar in the Caribbean. If the Bucs can land a guy who is an established top-shelf edge rusher — no more dudes who can’t put the bong down (allegedly) — just think how much more Vita Vea and Calijah Kancey would produce. That front line would become the NFL’s version of George Patton’s Third Army racing through France at will in 1944. Remember how the Bucs went bananas on drama queen Aaron Rodgers in Green Bay in the NFC title game after the 2020 season? The Packers could not handle Ndamukong Suh and Vea inside so they started cheating inside with their offensive line. As a result, Bucs sack king Shaq Barrett and Jason Pierre-Paul went wilding on Rodgers. That’s what a strong edge rusher would mean to the Bucs in 2025. The Bucs would be cooking with gas. (See! Not once did Joe mention Myles Garrett in this post.)|2025-02-05 06:29:00|293|35|9|Bucs|Bucs need elite edge rusher for Super Bowl contention.|6|Mixed sentiment about pursuing Myles Garrett, with some optimism, but concerns about cost and alternatives.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Lt.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/baker-mayfield-has-lavonte-davids-back/|Baker Mayfield Has Lavonte David’s Back|Last week and over the weekend, Pro Bowl practices and games were held in Orlando. Joe’s sure many of you purposely missed it just like Joe. (Joe sort of enjoyed the Pro Bowl when they allowed tackling. Whatever that abortion is they call “football” now is a disgrace to anyone who ever snapped on a chinstrap. For the record, the “other Joe” likes the new Pro Bowl and won a wager on Vita Vea’s team in the Tug of War.) At those practices, Joe’s good friend Rock Riley, the local sports media celebrity, caught up with Baker Mayfield. There, Mayfield teed off on, yet again, Lavonte David not making the Pro Bowl. That’s another reason Joe can no longer handle the Pro Bowl. If guys like David, a borderline Hall of Famer, isn’t deemed worthy of playing in it for years, then why should Joe pay any attention? “It’s still a shame Lavonte David is not here,” Mayfield said. “Like every year. I dunno.” Mayfield thought there were other Bucs worthy of being named to the Pro Bowl, but he didn’t elaborate. “We had a ton of guys that deserved to be here,” Mayfield said. In a way, he sort of sighed and added, “That’s the way it goes.” Then Mayfield added words that Joe hopes pay off in 2025. “Hopefully [the Bucs players snubbed from the Pro Bowl] use it as motivation,” Mayfield said. Mayfield did say he enjoyed himself in Orlando. Not so much because of the football, but Mayfield said what made the week was that he, Tristan Wirfs, Mike Evans and Vita Vea, were all at the pool together with their families. “You can’t beat that,” Mayfield said.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/xavier-worthy-mike-evans-is-the-best/|Xavier Worthy: Mike Evans Is The Best|A Longhorn going to bat for an Aggie? Joe’s heard everything now. Chiefs rookie wide receiver Xavier Worthy is a proud Longhorn. Texas Longhorn. Two hours to the northeast of Austin, home of the Longhorns, is College Station where Texas A&M sits. Yes, that’s the same school where Mike Evans transformed from being a high school basketball star into a first round NFL draft pick at wide receiver. Now? Evans and his Super Bowl ring are full steam ahead to Canton after he racked up 1,000 yards receiving this past year for the 11th straight time tying him with the great Jerry Rice And even though he gave a hated Aggie props, the Chiefs’ rookie said if he had to pick the best receiver in the game, it would be Evans. Why? Scoreboard, Worthy said. No receiver had done what Evans has done. The math doesn’t add up for anyone else. “I’m not even going to lie,” Worthy began, knowing he’s about to catch hell from the Longhorn faithful. “A lot of people are not going to like this answer. “But I feel like Mike Evans, after he is done, is going to be the best. If you have the most 1,000-yard seasons, that makes you the best, right? That makes the most sense.” Joe’s sure Evans himself would pause before saying he’s better than Jerry Rice or even Evans’ childhood idol Randy Moss. Remember: Evans just tied Rice’s record for 11 consecutive 1,000-yard seasons, but Rice had 14 of those seasons in total.  So Joe gets what Worthy is saying, but Evans isn’t there. Almost. That’s very big of a Longhorn to give an Aggie massive props like that. Worthy’s going to pay when he visits Texas.|2025-02-05 00:00:00|288|15|'5|Xavier Worthy|Chiefs rookie praises Mike Evans as best receiver.'|8|Fans are optimistic that Mike Evans could rank among the greatest receivers of all time.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""OR Buc"", ""post"": ""Evans would pause right now when comparing himself to the greats, but as noted by worthy, it\u2019s different if he gets the most.
