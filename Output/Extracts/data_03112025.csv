https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/tampa-bay-spokesman-chris-godwin/|Tampa Bay Spokesman, Chris Godwin|It’s not totally unusual to hear this from Bucs players, or players of other teams, when they decide to possibly pass up more cash from another club. They like it here. For Bucs receiver Chris Godwin, the Delaware native referred to Tampa as “home” for him and his wife, who have been together since they were in high school. “Me and Mariah got here when we were just kids,” Godwin said yesterday at One Buc Palace. “We were just out of college at 20 years old. We didn’t know a ton about Tampa but I think we quickly found out that this was a place that we were going to be able to call home. “Over the eight years since then, we’ve met a ton of people, we’ve got to work with a lot of really, really great people that have made our experience so so much better. I think when it comes down to making a tough decision like this, I think those are some of the things that come top of mind. “It’s family, it’s relationships, it’s being where you want to be [and] being where people want you. I couldn’t be happier to be coming back. We love Tampa, we love it here.” It’s one reason why Baker Mayfield decided to stick around. Like Godwin, when Mayfield signed with the Bucs, he knew very little about Tampa. The area quickly grew on him. It’s the same with Mike Evans, though he still maintains a residence in Texas not far from his hometown of Galveston. It’s also the same with big stars like former Bucs foot-rubbing tight end, Rob Gronkowski. He lives in Tampa. There are all sorts of examples of athletes staying in the area. The Bucs are lucky a big selling point for players to stay with the Bucs is the Tampa Bay area. No amount of cash can buy that.|2025-03-11 23:00:00|315|20|8|Chris Godwin|Godwin and others love Tampa Bay|3|Mixed sentiments about Tampa, focusing on traffic, culture, home feeling, and quality of life.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""BuucccNASTY"", ""post"": ""I love Tampa too"", ""post_time"": [""March"", ""12th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""1:12"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""gp"", ""post"": ""The traffic\u2019s not so great though."", ""post_time"": [""March"", ""12th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""1:22"", ""am""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""Cometowin2"", ""post"": ""So stoked that Chris is coming back.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/chris-godwin-says-staying-was-decision-was-very-very-tough/|Chris Godwin: Decision To Stay “Was Very, Very Tough”|Joe gets how some fans bristled a bit hearing Chris Godwin talk multiple times today about how returning to the Bucs was a difficult decision.  Godwin has already banked $80 million in salary as a National Football League player. So yeah, the average Joes hauling in five figures a year aren’t in Godwin’s league when it comes to agonizing about earnings and leaving a great Bucs organization that’s dropped a gargantuan fortune in your lap and was ready to do it again. Bucs general manager Jason Licht today strongly hinted today at Godwin’s re-signing news conference that reports of him leaving a giant contract on the table from another team were accurate. Licht mentioned “generational” money from an unnamed team and expressed gratitude that Godwin stayed home for the Bucs’ offer, which was a three-year, $66 million deal from the Bucs yesterday. Speaking on WDAE radio, Godwin said “home” was a big factor in him staying in Tampa, but it was still a rough call. “You know, it was a very, very tough decision, but I think like at the end of the day I had to lean on my gut and my intuition telling me that this is home,” Godwin said. “You know, me and [wife] Mariah, we have planted roots here so it would take a lot to remove me from this situation. And I’m grateful for the Bucs to be able to come to the table they way that they did as well to allow that to be a possibility.” This is a great reminder that the NFL is a business. Money can even come close to driving the bus for a team-first, dedicated warrior like Godwin. “I’ve never moved and made decisions solely based off of money,” Godwin added. Joe is so glad Godwin is back. The Bucs and fans have treated him like a king for years. And Joe hopes Godwin realizes he truly made the easy decision to stay with a Pro Bowl quarterback, a legendary receiver taking heat off him, a first-class organization and another massive contract. |2025-03-11 18:17:00|344|41|5|Chris Godwin|Tough decision to stay with Bucs despite tempting offers.|6|Positive sentiment overall with some concerns about injury and decision-making.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Smashsquatch"", ""post"": ""Class act.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/have-you-gone-home/|“Have You Gone Home?”|Joe’s glad to hear rookie Bucs offensive coordinator Josh Grizzard seems to appreciate the amazing hand he’s been dealt at 34 years old. He inherits an offense loaded with young veterans that just averaged 29.5 points per game last season. And he’s got a franchise quarterback. He’s also got mending stud receiver Chris Godwin (ankle surgery). Godwin endorsed Grizzard today at One Buc Palace. “There’s no doubt in my mind that he’s going to be incredibly successful because of the way that he approaches it,” Godwin said of Grizzard. “Like, every time I see Grizz, like I feel like I’m, ‘Have you gone home?’ Like he just loves ball and you can tell that he really, really puts his all into it. Those are the kind of guys you want to be around. Those are the kind of guys you want to work with.” Joe keeps hearing that Grizzard is all business to the extreme. In fact, at Grizzard’s introductory news conference last month, it appeared that Grizzard had no family members, significant other or friends not working for the Bucs in attendance. That was not typical. At that time, Joe asked someone in the know who said that was no surprise, as Grizzard is all business. As Dolphins head coach Mike McDaniel told Joe at the NFL Scouting Combine, Grizzard is a master of preparation.|2025-03-11 17:38:00|226|14|8|Josh Grizzard|Offensive coordinator praised for extreme dedication and preparation.|4|Commenters express optimism about the team's potential and focus on improving key areas.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Saskbucs"", ""post"": ""Please have a healthier season.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/jason-licht-no-receiving-duo-a-more-complete-package-than-mike-evans-and-chris-godwin/|Jason Licht: No Receiving Duo A More Complete Package Than Mike Evans And Chris Godwin|Bucs AC/DC-loving general manager Jason Licht was both jovial and a little emotional today when meeting with the local press in the wake of Chris Godwin agreeing to a three-year contract for some $66 million. Licht joked with Godwin that he only wears sportscoats for special occasions and he wore one this afternoon because bringing Godwin back on a third contract was special. Then Licht noted he was stressed out early this week trying to re-sign Godwin and he had to be very careful not to text Godwin too much as he might chase Godwin away. In fact, Licht said his wife had to persuade him to put the phone down, saying, “Don’t push him.” So why was Licht nervous and emotional? Licht said the more he respects a player, the more nervous and stressed he gets come contract time. Then Licht made a bold statement that isn’t too far off. Licht said when you combine the talents of Mike Evans and Godwin, and factor in their character, production and “selflessness,” there has been no better receiving duo in the history of the game. As Licht was saying this, Joe could probably think of one one-two punch that could top Evans and Godwin: Lynn Swann and John Stallworth. Both are Hall of Fame players with four rings each. And both were class gentlemen on and off the field. Other than those two Steelers legends who were last together 43 years ago, Joe thinks Licht might be accurate.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/chris-godwin-talks-health/|Chris Godwin Talks Health|Buccaneers Ring of Honor general manager Jason Licht joined one of his favorite football sons for a news conference at One Buc Palace today. Chris Godwin joined Licht to talk about his new three-year contract. Godwin also talked about his health. He was vague. “If you ask me, I feel like I’m right where I’m supposed to be [in recovery],” Godwin said. “You know, it’s a different injury than the last one, and these things take time. So, you know, if it’s one thing I’ve learned, you can’t rush a process.” Godwin dislocated his ankle in October. Other players have been running at this point in their recovery timelines. Godwin, however, has time. It’s March and he’s not a deadlines guy, he explained today. The iconic Bucs receiver said he’s more about the day to day and focusing on the daily peaks and valleys of recovery. Joe’s read and heard that a dislocated ankle is a 6 to 8 month recovery. But that’s just a range. Wherever Godwin falls in and out of that is unclear, and the Bucs are just fine with it. Still, Godwin is very excited about what the 2025 season could bring. “When we’re all healthy, we’re going to be a hell of an offense to try to deal with, and that excites me,” he said.|2025-03-11 17:17:00|220|15|8|Chris Godwin|Godwin optimistic about recovery and future season with Buccaneers.|3|Mixed responses with cautious optimism, some concerns about injury recovery, and confidence in team decisions.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Rod Munch"", ""post"": ""I\u2019m not worried about it, and apparently the rest of the NFL wasn\u2019t worried either since he reportedly got an offer from the Pats that would have paid him $20-million more than the Bucs did.

Or even playing in a game? Godwin is keeping that intel close to the vest. In fact, twice today speaking with the local pen and mic club, given the opportunity to explain how his rehab is going, Godwin only offered a couple of cliches, saying he didn’t want to get into the specifics. Is he even running on his surgically-repaired foot? Godwin wouldn’t say. The only light Godwin shined is that there are “peaks and valleys” in the process, just like he had when he came back from knee surgery two years ago. Does Godwin have a target date in mind in order to get on the practice field or perhaps play in a Week 1 game? Godwin said he hasn’t set a date because, he said, he is just focused on the “end” of the rehab, and not some empty target date that may or may not be met. “I feel good with where I’m at,” Godwin would only say about his rehab. One reason Godwin said that he doesn’t have a target date is he didn’t want to become too aggressive in trying to meet that date only to have a setback by rushing. Joe is just going to guess if the Bucs, with all their medical information, didn’t think Godwin could return, the Bucs wouldn’t have signed him to a three-year pact for some $66 million with $44 million of Team Glazer loot guaranteed.|2025-03-11 17:15:00|264|11|4|Chris Godwin|Godwin's vague updates on rehab progress and return timeline.|2|Concerns about injury recovery addressed cautiously, with optimism for eventual return to play.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""ghost"", ""post"": ""t kras tried to gently get some info in his interview and godwin wasnt having it either"", ""post_time"": [""March"", ""11th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""6:17"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Ed"", ""post"": ""I would hope the Bucs target him less over the middle and send him more towards the sidelines and deeper patterns so he\u2019s not dealing with as many bodies around the ball.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/anthony-nelson-returns/|Anthony Nelson Returns|In January when the Bucs lost to the Commandos, Joe didn’t like how Anthony Nelson reacted. Nelson walked around the locker room after the loss and took time to shake every teammate’s hand. It looked to Joe as if he was saying goodbye. Turns out that wasn’t the case. Today Nelson re-signed with the Bucs per Jeremy Fowler of BSPN. Nelson is a quality player off the bench. Sound fundamentals. Sneaky pass rush skills. In fact, until YaYa Diaby got hot late, it was Nelson who led outside linebackers in sacks for the Bucs for much of the season — off the bench! And who can forget how Nelson saved the 2024 season with a forced fumble in overtime at Carolina. Nelson is a solid glue guy.

The first round pick in the 2021 draft never panned out with the Bucs. His high-water mark was five sacks in 2023. Today, he signed with the Browns on a one-year, $4.75 million deal, reports Jordan Schultz of FOX Sports. JTS will now get to work with Jim Schwartz, the famed defensive guru who runs the Cleveland defense. Joe will be interested to see how JTS does now that the only thing he needs to worry about is rushing the passer and he won’t have to worry about covering DK Metcalf or Ja’Marr Chase.|2025-03-11 13:48:00|104|64|5|Joe Tryon-Shoyinka|Former Bucs player signs with Browns|5|Mixed feelings and varied opinions on JTS leaving, potential success, and coaching abilities.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""gotbbucs"", ""post"": ""Probably do well in a Wide-9 scheme."", ""post_time"": [""March"", ""11th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""2:54"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Pickgrin"", ""post"": ""1 year \u2013 $4.75M"", ""post_time"": [""March"", ""11th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""2:57"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""FlBoy84"", ""post"": ""But he\u2019s a Swiss Army knife\u2026"", ""post_time"": [""March"", ""11th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""2:59"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter3"": {""username"": ""heyjude"", ""post"": ""Somewhat surprised on this.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/report-jets-coaches-say-haason-reddick-still-has-it/|Report: Jets Coaches Say Haason Reddick Still Has It|Bucs fans from Gibsonton to East Lake must have loved watching the start of ESPN’s live coverage of the start of free agency yesterday. Super insider Adam Schefter was on the studio panel talking and quickly asked fellow insider Jeremy Fowler to take over for him. Something was blowing up Schefter phone. It turned out to be the Bucs’ signing of beastly edge rusher Haason Reddick. After ex-players and panelists Dan Orlovsky and Louis Riddick praised the signing, the chatter moved back to Fowler. “They were in on Khalil Mack a little bit,” Fowler said of the Bucs’ free agency approach at edge rusher. “They were looking high-end. This is more that next tier, Reddick.” “I was talking to the Jets coaches, they felt like [Reddick’s] play hadn’t dropped off, he just missed all [2024] offseason. Hmmm, so the Bucs were looking “high end.” Per Riddick, the Bucs may have found high-end if Reddick is the guy he was two seasons ago. “At his height, there was nobody better,” he said.|2025-03-11 11:43:00|171|34|7|Haason Reddick|Bucs sign edge rusher Reddick|6|Mixed reactions with cautious optimism and doubts about Reddick's potential impact on the team.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Aqualung"", ""post"": ""What if\u2026\u2026..what if Reddick is allowed to actually rush the quarterback?

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/chaos-in-atlanta/|Chaos In Atlanta|There are more than a few giant smiles at JoeBucsFan.com world headquarters, and they’re not just about the Bucs signing a quality edge rusher and Chris Godwin. Joe had some laughs looking at the slimy Saints hanging their edge rusher hopes on Chase Young (new three-year deal) and washed out Cameron Jordan. Oh, and they’re sticking with Derek Carr. But the big smiles came at the plight of the Falcons. They cut their stud defensive tackle Grady Jarrett this week (he signed fast with the Bears) and lost their quality center, Drew Dalman, in free agency. It seems like the Falcons tried to keep Dalman, a renowned run blocker, but he chased the money in Chicago. Atlanta has yet to replace Jarrett and Dalman, but they did sign an inside linebacker that’s weak in pass coverage, former Raiders LB Divine Deablo. Joe’s really enjoying the Falcons-fan angst on social media.|2025-03-11 11:01:00|150|39|5|Atlanta Falcons|Falcons struggling with roster changes and signings.|4|Mixed sentiment with some optimism and some pessimism towards team performance and coaching.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""BucDawg"", ""post"": ""Raheem is just a lousy HC.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/buccaneers-sign-veteran-punter-riley-dixon/|Buccaneers Sign Veteran Punter Riley Dixon|Two weeks ago at the NFL Scouting Combine, head coach Todd Bowles said he had one major ask of whomever punts for his team in 2025. Don’t shank’em. Yeah, the Bucs were a poor punting team last season, burning through three punters. Now they have a new one. The latest Bucs free agent signing is the guy who punted for Sean Payton and the Broncos last season, Riley Dixon. NFL Network says it’s a two-year, $6 million deal. The nine-year veteran has never missed a game. He’s also punted for the Giants and Rams. Dixon’s 42-yard net punting average in 2024 was the second-best of his career.|2025-03-11 10:32:00|107|38|'8|Riley Dixon|Bucs sign experienced punter to improve team's performance.'|4|Mixed reactions to punter signing, some optimism, skepticism, and questions about other players.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Tampabaybucfan"", ""post"": ""At least we didn\u2019t draft one\u2026."", ""post_time"": [""March"", ""11th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""11:35"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""BuckyBuc"", ""post"": ""hm, i was interested in seeing that kid we got from the CFL"", ""post_time"": [""March"", ""11th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""11:36"", ""am""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""Faspro"", ""post"": ""Nice!"", ""post_time"": [""March"", ""11th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""11:36"", ""am""]}, ""commenter3"": {""username"": ""Duck Fart"", ""post"": ""Can he drop back into coverage 15 yards off the receiver on 3rd and 6?"", ""post_time"": [""March"", ""11th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""11:36"", ""am""]}, ""commenter4"": {""username"": ""Lightningvinny"", ""post"": ""On to the next thing"", ""post_time"": [""March"", ""11th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""11:38"", ""am""]}, ""commenter5"": {""username"": ""Zoocomics"", ""post"": ""@BuckyBuc\u2026 depending on the guaranteed money, I think we will still see the CFL Punter at camp."", ""post_time"": [""March"", ""11th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""11:39"", ""am""]}, ""commenter6"": {""username"": ""Curse of Gruden"", ""post"": ""Tampabaybucfan Says: March 11th, 2025 at 11:35 am At least we didn\u2019t draft one\u2026."", ""post_time"": [""March"", ""11th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""11:52"", ""am""]}, ""commenter7"": {""username"": ""BPBucsfan"", ""post"": ""Wish I could get $6 million to punt a football. \ud83c\udfc8 Lol.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/chris-godwin-dak-prescott-and-allen-hurns/|Chris Godwin, Dak Prescott And Allen Hurns|The Bucs are confident in Chris Godwin’s ability to return to full strength after an ugly dislocated ankle. That’s why they handed him a fat three-year contract yesterday. But when will Godwin get back to 100 percent? That’s unclear and likely still will be after Godwin meets with media late this afternoon. At the NFL Scouting Combine two weeks ago, Joe learned Godwin’s status was very much day-by-day — very slow and steady improvement. Important benchmarks were still head. And as Joe noted prior to yesterday, there was no social media video of Godwin running to show the world he’s made great progress. Joe is encouraged, though, by Dak Prescott, whose nasty dislocated ankle and broken leg years ago was chronicled by Dallas media and ESPN like Joe studies the perfect browning of a Hooters tater tot. He recovered well. Prescott, however, doesn’t play receiver. Joe read a lot about former NFL receiver Allen Hurns’ recover from a dislocated ankle and broken leg suffered in January of 2019 with the Cowboys. He was back on the Cowboys practice field in minicamp five months after the injury claiming he was 90 percent healthy. A month later, the Cowboys asked him to take a pay cut. He wouldn’t and he was cut. Miami picked up Hurns within hours and he played 14 games that season with 32 catches. Miami even extended his contract. So Joe feels great about that story in relation to Godwin, though it’s been almost five months since Godwin’s injury and little is known about his status. Unfortunately, Joe can’t glean more from Hurns. In 2020, he opted out of playing all season because of The Sickness. A year later he injured his wrist and never played again. |2025-03-11 09:05:00|289|14|3|Chris Godwin|Uncertainty surrounds Chris Godwin's recovery from dislocated ankle.|4|Mixed sentiments on Godwin's recovery, potential draft picks, and team's depth at WR.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Truth be Told"", ""post"": ""Trust in Jason!"", ""post_time"": [""March"", ""11th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""10:09"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""OHBucFan"", ""post"": ""And in Godwin.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/bucs-get-a-b-grade/|Bucs Get A “B”|What a day for the Bucs yesterday. Keeping key veterans and finding an edge rusher? That may become the second-best free agent haul the Bucs have ever had. The best haul the Bucs had? Easy, 2020 when the Bucs landed Tom Brady. Case closed. Over at CBS, Tyler Sullivan was also impressed what the Bucs did — all within the first 30 minutes of the free agency siren sounding at high noon. Bucs AC/DC-loving general manager Jason Licht wasted zero time. Sullivan was impressed enough to give the Bucs a “B” grade. Key additions: EDGE Haason Reddick Key re-signings: WR Chris Godwin (Read more), OG Ben Bredeson Key departures: OT Robert Hainsey (Jaguars) Remarkably, the Bucs were able to retain wideout Chris Godwin, despite him getting to the open market. Even with a lot of teams vying for his services, he elects to stay put and maintain what is one of the better one-two punches at receiver between him and Mike Evans for Baker Mayfield. Tampa Bay also added to its pass-rushing group with Haason Reddick on a one-year, $14 million deal. This prove-it deal could be beneficial for the Buccaneers as they’ll get a motivated Reddick playing for a bigger deal next offseason after a tumultuous season in New York. Joe believes Reddick will be a catalyst for the Bucs’ pass rush. Now, teams cannot just gang up on Vita Vea and Calijah Kancey. They will have to devote manpower to stopping Reddick. Oh, and YaYa Diaby will get more single-blocking, too. If Reddick can get on a roll, opposing offenses won’t have the manpower to devote extra blockers to all four Bucs pass rushers Reddick, Vea, Kancey and YaYa. And nothing helps a secondary like a good, strong pass rush.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/selection-at-no-19-comes-into-clearer-focus/|Selection At No. 19 Comes Into Clearer Focus|As is often the case, what a team does in free agency is often a strong tell for what the team will do in the draft. Joe has stated repeatedly that if one of the following are selected by the Bucs at No. 19 in the draft next month, Joe will be happy and content. * Emeka Egbuka, WR, Ohio State. * Mike Green, edge rusher, Marshall. * Jihaad Campbell, LB, Alabama. Any would be an excellent addition. But let’s be real, with the Bucs bringing Chris Godwin back, Joe isn’t sure how wise it would be to draft the Buckeyes’ Godwin clone at No. 19, unless Godwin has a setback in his rehab. Still, drafting a receiver in the first round when your Nos. 1 and 2 receivers are 32- and 29-years old isn’t a completely stupid move. The rookie can ease his way into the lineup. And, with the signing of Hasson Reddick while already having YaYa Diaby on board and expecting “shock” from Chris Braswell in 2025, Joe’s not sure drafting Green at No. 19 is wise. Of course, a team can never have enough good edge rushers. Then there is Campbell at No. 19. To Joe, it sure seems like that’s what the Bucs plans are. Yesterday the Bucs did not address inside linebacker. There are scant decent ones left. So it’s Lavonte David and… who? Sure, SirVocea Dennis makes plays. When he’s on the field. And that’s the issue. He makes Jamel Dean look like Rondé Barber from an availability perspective. Joe isn’t sure how the Bucs can responsibly say Dennis is their guy when Dennis cannot (yet) stay healthy. Would Joe love to see Dennis start 17 games? Hell, yes. But Joe is a burning bush kind of guy and has to see it to believe it. Hoping and wishing are for nursery rhymes and prom nights, not the National Football League. So Joe thinks the Bucs have a big bull’s eye on Campbell. Hey, if Dennis proves he can stay on the field, then you have an excellent piece of depth and, when David retires, Dennis can take over there. Campbell is so versatile and can do so many things, including rushing the passer and blitzing, Joe doesn’t know how the Bucs could pass on a quality Nick Saban linebacker with so many current questions marks at inside linebacker. So yeah, Egbuka would be cool. Green would be tantalizing. But Campbell would be the smart pick for now and into the future. (“But Joe, what about corner?” Bucs AC/DC-loving general manager Jason Licht has done a solid job in the past at getting quality corners later in the draft.)|2025-03-11 06:00:00|446|66|5|Selection at No. 19|Bucs draft decision-making process analyzed.|3|Comments express mixed sentiments on defensive draft needs, players, and potential strategies.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Lt.

Everyone seems to forget that 30 year old Deion Jones and his 13 career INTs with 5 of those returned for touchdowns is under contract and Bowles spoke highly of him.  Ezreiaku, Emmanwori, Egbuka are my top three in that order, ideally with a little trade back.  I don\u2019t think the Bucs will draft Green or Pearce if they are available due to character issues and neither would I.  Green doesn\u2019t have the length to be a productive force in the NFL and can\u2019t keep his hands to himself.  Pearce I could live with since he has all the physical tools but needs to beef up and mature.  Egbuka and Jalon Walker both shine in interviews. Walker will surely be gone but despite Godwin signing I\u2019d still take Egbuka at 19.  He really is a Godwin clone who additionally was a boss center fielder.  I think Emmanwori would be a better pick to address 2024\u2019s defensive woes than Campbell.  He is Kam Chancellor with better speed and man coverage skills.  He Winfield and Smith would make teams wary of working the middle.  Ezreiaku is my favorite though.  His technique is phenomenal and he talks it like he walks it in film breakdowns.  Baldy will have special feelings for him like he does Clancy.  He also has the arm length and wingspan of top OT prospects to go with his elite times in the agility drills.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/best-available-free-agents/|Best Available Free Agents|OK, Joe is typing this here article late Monday. Free agency is a moving target and there are guys still hooking up with new teams. So Joe is going to take a stab at some of the best players still available at positions of need for the Bucs, corner and linebacker. Cornerback Asante Samuel, Chargers A 2021 second-round pick by the Chargers, Asante Samuel played at Florida State so he’s used to the heat and humidity. However, his smallish frame (5-10) is not ideal. Surprisingly, he’s not brittle for a little guy. In his first three seasons, he only missed five games. Last year Samuel did miss most of the season with a shoulder injury. Samuel has admitted he was also dealing with a stinger for years dating back to his college days. Another red flag: Samuel is allergic to tackling. Mike Hilton, Bengals If Bucs coach Todd Bowles moves Tykee Smith to safety full-time, then Hilton could be a nice add to the slot. Hilton loves and is effective at blitzing, which is right up Bowles’ alley. And Hilton really good against the run but he tends to be a bit toasty in coverage. Linebacker Eric Kendricks, Cowboys This guy is a tackling machine who had three forced fumbles and two picks last season. That’s the good. Now the bad: He’s 33. Do the Bucs want to pair a 33-year old linebacker with a 35-year old linebacker on the inside? He’s a Mike Zimmer guy, which is why the Cowboys are likely parting ways. Kyzir White, Cardinals A smallish linebacker since he’s a converted safety, he is a better pass defender at linebacker than a run-stuffer. Speedy and we all know you cannot coach speed.
