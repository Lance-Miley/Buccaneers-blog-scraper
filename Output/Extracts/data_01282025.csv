https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/clown-label-suggested-for-some-bucs-fans/|“Clown” Label Suggested For Some Bucs Fans|A guy who collects a check from the Buccaneers reached his personal hate tolerance, apparently, as the calls for Todd Bowles’ firing spread like a wildfire through Bucs fandom late this season. Buccaneers Radio Network voice T.J. Rives seemed to let his guard down a bit on his final podcast following the Bucs’ home loss to the Commanders in the playoffs. Rives was adamant that Bucs fans must consider the 2024 Tampa Bay season with appreciation and respect. If you’re among the masses that feel disappointed and have lost a their share of confidence in Todd Bowles, Rives doesn’t want to hear you. “You have to view this as a successful season. I don’t care what kind of clown you are that thinks that somehow we should fire everybody into the sun …,” Rives said. Ouch! Are you a “clown?” Joe knows a lot of fans who feel this season’s one-and-done in the playoffs was a letdown, a step backward from the 2023 campaign. In fact, Joe would suggest a typical casual Bucs fan (of which their are hundreds of thousands) would view the Bucs’ season exactly that way — because the team didn’t advance as far. The 2024 Bucs succeeded in winning the NFC South by two games. It’s to be applauded, but Joe respects those fans who feel a coaching upheaval is warranted. Joe doesn’t tell anyone how to be a fan. Rives wasn’t all bouquets, he acknowledged the Bucs defense was “frustrating” with “confusion in your secondary” that he called “awful,” and lacking takeaways and an edge pass rush. One thing Joe can type with certainty is that if the Bucs don’t progress in the standings and in the playoffs next season, there will be a lot more “clowns” on the streets, to use Rives’ word.|2025-01-28 18:56:00|299|83|3|Todd Bowles|Fans divided on Bucs' season and future coaching changes.|3|Mixed sentiments with some strong negativity and some positive comments about Bowles' coaching.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""SB~LV"", ""post"": ""Hate is a strong word but as a radio personality I HATE TJ going back to his first days on Tampa radio, just something about his presentation and personality"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""28th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""7:03"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Demete"", ""post"": ""Pot calling the kettle black"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""28th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""7:03"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""Dadgumit"", ""post"": ""You do realize this is an opinion-driven website\u2026 Archives are here.\u2013Joe"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""28th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""7:08"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter3"": {""username"": ""DoooshLaRue"", ""post"": ""I hate the HC but love our team."", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""28th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""7:10"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter4"": {""username"": ""David Kilmer"", ""post"": ""It is a good thing fans don\u2019t run the show!!.

However with that said being a fan , I think w e were all excited at how good the offense was, especially when Godwin was playing. However, at the same time everyone saw the defense, usually a strength had major issues personnel wise. Additionally, the injuries only made things worse. It definitely was hard not to get frustrated with this defense this year. However if you remember Licht said they knew the defense needed pieces and they were not all going to happen this, so the Bucs knew full welll where they were. I will reserve judgment on Bowles until he gets the pieces he needs. With that said, you live with the blitz you die by the blitz and teams definitely know how to beat his scheme. I doubt his scheme changes , but hopefully the pieces do. The grass isn\u2019t always greener and this may be the case with Bowles.

Why did the Buccaneers blast them again early in this season. Because their two starting wide receivers were injured and out. Bowles is not without flaws.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/baker-mayfield-makes-pro-bowl/|Baker Mayfield Makes Pro Bowl|Another day, another Bucs Pro Bowler announced. The reigning Pro Bowl MVP will return to the game, Baker Mayfield. The Pro Bowl, once something worth watching (years ago) and now little more than a joke flag football game not interesting enough to get you to click out of a college basketball game, will have last year’s MVP return. He’ll play in Orlando this weekend to replace Jayden Daniels who will not play. Last week, it was learned that Bucs QB coach Thad Lewis and inside linebackers coach Larry Foote were added to “coach” Eli Manning’s staff. Joe isn’t sure if that is a bonus or a sentence. Joe has a hunch the Manning Bros. and their “Omaha Productions” are producing the Pro Bowl and all the nonsense around it. That’s because the Manning Bros. are the coaches, and were last year. Joe guesses someone on Park Ave. in Manhattan, across the street from NFL headquarters, did some dumb study that determined the Mannings play in Pinckneyville so they have to be involved in everything NFL-related on the four-letter. The game quite literally is a flag football game. Joe thinks it is cool Mayfield got this honor because Joe is certain he’ll get a bonus out of it, along with Mike Evans, Tristan Wirfs and Vita Vea.|2025-01-28 15:29:00|216|37|7|Baker Mayfield|Mayfield returns as Pro Bowl MVP amidst lackluster game criticism.|7|Mixed sentiment with varying opinions on Pro Bowl selections and format.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""BallHawk75"", ""post"": ""Great.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/evaluating-ben-bredeson/|Evaluating Ben Bredeson|Joe chuckled hearing former Jets and Jaguars pass rusher Jeff Lageman take a shot at the Bucs’ interior offensive line this week. But he’s sort of not alone. Lageman, a 1989 first-round pick who had a nice 10-year career, works for the Jaguars media team and appeared to be trying to prop up new Jacksonville head coach Liam Coen on radio this week. Lageman praised Bucs left tackle Tristan Wirfs and center Graham Barton but said he was unimpressed by the rest of the O-line Coen worked with in Tampa this season. It was a clown take, but Bucs left guard Ben Bredeson isn’t getting much love from analysts as he approaches free agency in six weeks. Bredeson is ranked by Pro Football Network as the 22nd-best interior offensive lineman availale in free agency (if he’s not re-signed first). The PFF tribe doesn’t rank Bredeson very well, either. Joe thinks that’s almost silly for a 26-year-old that just blocked for an elite rushing and passing team. Keep in mind Bredeson has a heck of a pedigree, starting for a University of Michigan offensive line that has had tremendous success in the NFL, including center/guard Cesar Ruiz, guard Michael Onwenu and tackle/guard John Runyan, Jr. All those guys got fat second NFL contracts. Joe is confident the Bucs want Bredeson back in order to keep continuity on the line; it’s rare to have an entire offensive line return, especially a strong line like the Bucs’. But where will they set his value? Would they dare to let him test free agency? And might Bredeson look at the Bucs as an unstable situation because Tampa Bay changes offensive coordianators like underwear and the ground under Todd Bowles may be shaky beyond next season?|2025-01-28 15:15:00|291|28|7|Ben Bredeson|Evaluating Ben Bredeson's future with Bucs.|3|Mixed opinions on Bredeson, potential re-signing, and offensive line performance.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Durango 95"", ""post"": ""And might Bredeson look at the Bucs as an unstable situation because Tampa Bay changes offensive coordianators like underwear and the ground under Todd Bowles may be shaky beyond next season? \u2014- By only changing the name of the player I can only imagine the amount of times Joe will be able to recycle a similar ending to many of the stories he will write during the upcoming FA cycle."", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""28th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""3:25"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""BallHawk75"", ""post"": ""Can we get some articles regarding the wide open, drive a truck through, grand canyon like, Swiss cheese pass defense that Bowles claims \u201cJust gotta be better\u201d?"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""28th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""3:25"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""Dewey Selmon"", ""post"": ""Top 5 in every major offensive category.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/bucs-spending-hours-tapping-into-rams-intel/|Bucs Spending Hours Tapping Into Rams’ Intel|Either the Bucs really want another coach from the Sean McVay tree or they’re pulling an Al Davis, trying to capture Rams intel the way the paranoid feds think Red China is using TikTok as a tool against innocent Americans. The Bucs today interviewed Rams quarterback coach Dave Ragone, types Josh Alper of Pro Football Talk. Joe really, really hopes this interview was nothing more than a fishing expedition because Ragone’s resume before his one season with the Rams is positively frightening. Some, um, highlights: * He spent three years with the Titans, two as a wide receivers coach and one as a quarterback under the guidance of offensive wizard Mike Munchak. The quarterbacks Ragone helped lead were the likes of Ryan Fitzpatrick and Jake Locker. As receivers coach, Ragone coached up Nate Washington and a bunch of slugs. (Kenny Britt, anyone?) * After a season working quality control with Brother of Chucky in Washington, Ragone worked for three years in Chicago as quarterbacks coach. There, Ragone was known best for his work molding Mitch Trubisky. * Moving to Atlanta, Ragone then spent three seasons as the offensive coordinator for Artie Smith and the Dixie Chicks. Good thing this guy is friends with McVay. Otherwise, he might be an assistant at Wake Forest or Troy. Ordinarily, it’s hard to go wrong with a McVay disciple. But in Ragone’s case, he’s going to need at least a half-dozen years with McKay to rewire his head to undo what he has previously learned. In no way does Joe want anyone running the Bucs offense in 2025 who had anything to do with Trubisky or Smith.|2025-01-28 12:46:00|273|39|5|Dave Ragone|Bucs interviewing Rams' Ragone; mixed sentiment regarding his credentials.|5|Mixed opinions on coaching decisions, concern about privacy, some optimism for upcoming changes.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Watch Daddy Sling It"", ""post"": ""Who knows?

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/furious-jason-licht/|“Furious” Jason Licht|So a Google search shows many media references to Buccaneers Ring of Honor general manager Jason Licht being “furious” after Bucs offensive coordinator Liam Coen’s controversial departure from Tampa. In fact, “furious” was used again yesterday to describe Licht, four days after Coen bolted for Jacksonville. Joe waited a day to share this to see if the Buccaneers media executives and Licht would demand a retraction (as Joe speculates they did last week). But nope, it’s still there. Licht is referred to as “furious” in a Monday afternoon story at TampaBay.com. Coen knows general manager Jason Licht is furious with him. Maybe head coach Todd Bowles is, too. “And I want Jason to be good with it,” Coen said. “I love Jason. Those guys gave me an opp! I’ll never forget that. But time heals. Time heals. We’ll be all right.” Last week, ESPN NFL insider Adam Schefter referred to Bucs officials as “irate” and said he’d never experienced this level of rage from a team this century. Joe hopes Licht is no longer furious, if he ever was. (Joe doesn’t necessarily believe the unsourced reports of Licht’s fury). That would be unhealthy. However, Joe’s secret new fantasy is Licht’s fury lingers and he lashes out by purchasing an A-list edge rusher in March. Regardless, Licht has a right to be furious with the actions of El Serpiente, aka Coen. Licht is an accountability guy and Coen did not behave honorably in his Bucs exit, disrespecting those at One Buc Palace that afforded him nearly every possible consideration. |2025-01-28 11:57:00|258|95|4|Jason Licht|Licht is referred to as furious over offensive coordinator's departure.|2|Mixed sentiments with criticism towards Coen and management, some optimism for future success.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""David"", ""post"": ""Somehow, I hope this translates into the Buccaneers winning more.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/liam-coen-talks-bucs-run-game-investment/|Liam Coen Talks Bucs’ Run Game, “Investment”|Yes, Jaguars head coach Liam Coen was talking Bucs yesterday. And no, Joe’s not referring to El Serpiente, the former Bucs offensive coordinator, speaking at his introductory news conference. Coen talked on 92.5 FM in Jacksonville and chatted about his success in Tampa. He explained getting a fast buy-in from his Bucs offense because of the commitment he and his offensive staff displayed. Coen said he and his team sat down with players and detailed three things they did very well in 2023 and three areas in which coaches thought they could improve. Per Coen, that deep personal assessment made in impact. “I think they saw an investment in them early on,” he said. Coming to a very successful Bucs organization, Coen said, put added pressure on him to impress players and build on their strong foundations. Coen said he’s not taking all the credit for the Bucs’ improvement last seeason, but he’s putting some of it on his résumé. “The run game, the culture, the identity, that was something we were proud of in terms of improving those areas,” Coen said. Joe will give Coen a ton of credit for the run game. The guy schemed the run like Joe hadn’t seen in Tampa. Heck, the Bucs’ run game racked up more yards than in any season ever — and the yards per carry was impressive while Baker Mayfield ranked third in the NFL in passing yards. As for the culture and the identity, well, Joe isn’t throwing endless flowers at Coen for that. Perhaps Joe will toss Coen a rodent he can swallow whole.|2025-01-28 11:11:00|266|45|6.5|Liam Coen|Liam Coen discusses success of Bucs' offense improvement strategies.|4|Mixed sentiments about Coen, acknowledging offensive line success but criticizing defense and coaching integrity.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Hodad"", ""post"": ""Coen who?"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""28th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""11:13"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""JayBuc"", ""post"": ""Coen does deserve some credit.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/buyers-remorse-3/|Buyer’s Remorse|The Bucs had a lot of disappointing play from many defenders this season. Hard-hitting safety Jordan Whitehead had coaches and suits downright giddy in March when the Bucs were able to bring him back in free agency. The Pitt product was a key element in the Bucs’ Super Bowl win for the 2020 season. He left to get paid by the Jets. Joe can’t blame him. Whitehead returned to Tampa the Bucs couldn’t believe their good fortune. Premature jocularity. Though Whitehead displayed supreme toughness in coming back from a midseason pec injury that would have shelved most players for the season, he simply wasn’t the same player he was four years ago. Joe wasn’t the only one to recognize this. The PFF tribe believes Whitehead was the most disappointing free agent signing last year. Whitehead returned to Tampa Bay and was the only external player on the team given a multi-year contract. Unfortunately, he played only 12 games. Tampa Bay will likely aim to improve their secondary this offseason, and Whitehead could be on the chopping block. Joe has said the following on the “Ira Kaufman Podcast” for months: Joe believes that if you gave Bucs defensive coaches truth serum, they’d confess to having buyer’s remorse with Whitehead. Joe could see Whitehead was an inferior player compared to the guy the Bucs drafted in 2018. The Bucs simply need better play in the middle of their defense. Defensive tackles are excellent. But inside linebackers (sans Lavonte David) and the safety play was poor. A healthy Antoine Winfield and better play from Whitehead will go a long way to repairing this defense.|2025-01-28 10:30:00|271|46|3|Jordan Whitehead|Mixed reviews on Whitehead's performance|3|Mixed sentiments with concerns about Whitehead's performance, injuries, coaching staff, and defense strategy.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Bucnjim"", ""post"": ""I was one of those fans excited to get Whitehead back, but it didn\u2019t work out.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/what-about-chris-godwin/|What About Chris Godwin?|On face value, it seems like an easy decision to make on Chris Godwin. The Bucs, especially the suits, love Godwin. Who doesn’t? But the free agent receiver is likely looking at his final big bite at the NFL apple with his next contract. So Joe guesses Godwin, who turns 29 in a month and could become a free agent in March, is going to want to get paid by someone. Dan Graziano of BSPN seems to think Godwin returning to Tampa is no slam dunk. Latest on whether they will re-sign wide receiver Chris Godwin: He has been a mainstay for the Bucs, but Godwin will also be coming off a season-ending ankle injury, and Tampa Bay just paid out a big contract to fellow receiver Mike Evans last offseason. Add in the encouraging late-season performance by rookie Jalen McMillan and it’s possible Godwin has played his last game as a Buc. It may boil down to who the Bucs offensive coordinator is. If the new OC is a modern, open-minded guy (like Liam Coen and current Rams assistant Nate Scheelhaase), then that guy will surely want someone as dependable as Godwin to throw to. If the Bucs bring in some run, run, run-the-ball guy (like Dave Canales), spending big money on two receivers might be deemed too much. When you look at all the Bucs’ defensive holes, Joe could see how coaches could make the case Godwin’s potential payday may be better spent on defense, especially if Lavonte David retires. Joe is not certain if the Bucs fully know how much they want to pay for Godwin’s return. Coming off an injury, the Bucs may get Godwin at a bargain price. Many teams will shy away from a receiver coming off ankle surgery.|2025-01-28 01:42:00|295|62|5|Chris Godwin|Uncertain future for Godwin with Tampa Bay Buccaneers.|5|Mixed opinions on retaining Godwin, considering his injuries and contract implications.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/report-liam-coen-trying-to-lure-mike-greenberg-to-jacksonville/|Report: Liam Coen Trying To Lure Mike Greenberg To Jacksonville|Joe was always scared that ex-Bucs offensive coordinator and current Jags head coach Liam Coen would lift Bucs offensive line coach Kevin Carberry and bring him to Jacksonville. But it appears another Team Glazer employee is his target. Tony Pauline of Sportskeeda.com reports Coen is trying to lure Bucs assistant general manager Mike Greenberg to northeast Florida to run the Jags’ front office. Of course, in his work trying to get Coen to Jacksonville, Jags owner Shad Con Khan ran off former general manager Trent Baalke and, as part of his sales job on Coen, Con Khan told Coen he could influence the new general manager hire. Pauline types he has been told Coen is “pushing hard” to get Greenberg to Jacksonville. And Pauline also notes the only thing stopping Greenberg is if he wants the job. Of course, last week everything broke about how the Bucs couldn’t reach Coen (allegedly) while he flew a clandestine mission to Jacksonville for a second interview. Allegedly, a Bucs official whose calls/texts went unreturned was Greenberg. Greenberg knows exactly what really happened. (So much reported was unsourced allegations.) If Greenberg thinks he or the Bucs were wronged, Greenberg may not be in such a hurry to get to Jacksonville. In a way, Greenberg is in the same boat as Coen was last week. There are only 32 of these gigs available. Who knows if Greenberg will ever be offered a general manager’s job again.|2025-01-28 01:30:00|241|58|5|Mike Greenberg|Liam Coen wants to bring Mike Greenberg to Jacksonville.|3|Mixed reactions to Coen's departure and Greenberg potentially following him to Jacksonville.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Aqualung"", ""post"": ""Greenberg probably realizes if he stays with the Bucs, he\u2019ll be required to play deep middle in the Cover Who defense.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/nick-caley-interviews-with-bucs/|Nick Caley Interviews With Bucs|So last night the Bucs pumped out news that they interviewed Nick Caley, a Rams tight ends coach to succeed Liam Coen. Joe’s reaction? Whoop-tee-do. Sorry if Joe cannot get worked up over a tight ends coach with a thin resume. OK, OK, he worked for Bill Belichick. So did Charlie Weis and Josh McDaniels. You see anyone fitting them for a gold jacket? Joe watched old videos where Boston media was triggered when Caley left New England. Not sure why. Oh, he worked with foot-rubbing Rob Gronkowski a couple of years. That’s it! Caley is currently the passing game coordinator with the Rams and tight ends coach. Sorry, when Joe thinks of tight ends coaches who became offensive coordinators, Joe thinks of Mike Shula and Brian Schottenheimer. Boring-arse run-on-first-down, run-on-second-down, force-passes-short-of-the-chains offense. That’s offensive! No thanks! If the Bucs are going to hire a Rams assistant, Joe is far more interested in Nate Scheelhaase. Have the Bucs reached out to Lincoln Riley yet? (Before you hit Joe with “Have you seen Lincoln Riley’s salary, Joe?,” go research his job security at USC. It ain’t good. You can’t make a dime if you aren’t employed and Riley just may want to get ahead of the Grim Reaper. Chip Kelly did just that last year quitting UCLA to become a coordinator. Google is your friend.)|2025-01-28 00:00:00|224|28|2|Nick Caley|Bucs interview Rams coach for offensive coordinator position.|4|Mixed feelings with some optimism but overall skepticism and uncertainty.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Buccaneer Bonzai"", ""post"": ""Josh McDaniels is probably worthy of a gold jacket from his time with the Patriots "", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""28th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""12:17"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Durango 95"", ""post"": ""\u201cBoring-arse run-on-first-down, run-on-second-down, force-passes-short-of-the-chains offense.\u201d \u2014 \u201cEver get the feeling you\u2019ve been cheated?\u201d"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""28th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""12:17"", ""am""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""BA\u2019s Red Pen"", ""post"": ""I will not pretend to be an expert on offensive coordinators but Bowles, who isn\u2019t my favorite, is 2 for 2 with his OC hires.

Keep an open mind. He has more pro coaching experience than Scheelhaase. I\u2019d have to agree that Scheelhaase is more intriguing, but I\u2019ll leave it up to Bowles and Licht to make this decision. They\u2019ve done well 2 years in a row. My guess is that our coach and front office are a little more plugged into qualified candidates, and there\u2019s a lot of qualities you have to balance when picking a coordinator. I\u2019m glad they\u2019re looking at a lot of young guys with a variety of backgrounds. It\u2019s also helpful for the organization to have some intel on coaches for future staffing.
