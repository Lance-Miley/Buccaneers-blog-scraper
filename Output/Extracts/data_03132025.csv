https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/bucs-make-moves-at-tackle/|Bucs Make Moves At Tackle|The Bucs lost a guy Joe hoped they would keep. A couple of hours later, the Bucs apparently found his replacement. Now Joe knows that the mere mention of backup tackle Justin Skule gives many Bucs an immediate case of the shivers. But Joe has to be fair. After starting for concussed Luke Goedeke at right tackle in Week 2 at Detroit, Skule got fully worked over by Aidan Hutchison. It was gruesome, maybe the worst Joe has seen since Kenyatta Walker tried to tangle with Julius Peppers. Once that horrid game was over, Skule did a nice job subbing for Goedeke. Just before the bye, Tristan Wirfs got hurt against the 49ers and Skule had to replace him. Joe thought Nick Bosa was going to run wild on Skule. Oh, Bosa made a play or two, but Skule did a solid job on one of the best pass rushers in the game. So Skule developed into quite a solid backup tackle. Joe was hoping the Bucs would keep him. Instead, Skule hustled off to Minneapolis. A couple of hours after the news of Skule was announced, the Bucs signed free agent veteran tackle Charlie Heck. Last year playing for both Arizona and San Francisco, Heck had two starts, both for the 49ers. He’s 28 years old and stands 6-8, 320 pounds. Houston drafted Heck in 2020 out of North Carolina in the fourth round. In 2021, Heck started 13 games at right tackle for the Texans. In the past three seasons, Heck has six starts.|2025-03-13 22:18:00|256|35|4|Bucs|Bucs find replacement for departing tackle|3|Comments are mixed, some positive, some negative, with a general sense of uncertainty.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""OR Buc"", ""post"": ""What the heck"", ""post_time"": [""March"", ""13th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""10:44"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""toopanca"", ""post"": ""Plantar fasciitis problem last year \u2013 very fixable.

At Godwin’s news conference announcing his massive new contract on Tuesday, the Bucs’ stud receiver avoided all specifics when talking about his potential return to health. Buccaneers Ring of Honor general manager Jason Licht shared the news conference but nobody in the media throng attending asked him when he expects Godwin on the field. However, Godwin hopped on SiriusXM NFL Radio and co-host Pat Kirwan talked to Godwin about seeing him on the field in-person this summer in training camp. Godwin responded with a huge smile in his voice as well as a chuckle. He acknowledged that he’ll be happy to be back on the field. “You’ll see me drenched in sweat, as always,” Godwin said. What Godwin said after that came out garbled garbled, but he referenced “dripping” and “sweat marks” when he sits down for another interview with Kirwan at One Buc Palace.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/bucs-sign-veteran-cornerback-kindle-vildor/|Bucs Sign Veteran Cornerback Kindle Vildor|The Bucs have locked down a five-year veteran cornerback with experience in big games, not all of it good. Kindle Vildor is a new Buccaneer, per NFL Network. Vildor started all three Lions playoff games two seasons ago and last year played all 17 games on a Lions secondary ravaged by injuries. He also was a strong special teams player for Detroit. Vildor is infamous in Detroit for the NFC Championship throw that went off his face and into the hands of 49ers receiver Brandon Aiyuk for a monster gain in the 49ers comeback win (see photo above). Originally a fifth-round draft pick of the Bears in 2020, Vildor was on the Titans roster for six weeks in 2023. Vildor, 27, will earn a veteran minimum salary. At 5-11, he’s shorter than a typical Todd Bowles outside cornerback. Ira Kaufman Talks Free Agency News, Cream Cheese, Calls The Bucs’ First-Round Draft Pick, Value(?)

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/it-does-not-make-sense-to-do-this-if-youre-not-in-it-to-win-a-championship/|“It Does Not Make Sense To Do This If You’re Not In It To Win A Championship”|For Chris Godwin, there is a reason he puts himself through so much blood, sweat and toil to be a top NFL professional. Godwin’s a laid-back guy, so fame isn’t really his thing. He doesn’t have a big ego to the point that he needs that ego to be fed by the spotlight. The only reason Godwin says he torments himself to be the best is to chase another Super Bowl ring. “I’m extremely hungry for it,” Godwin said of trying to get Ring No. 2. “To me, it does not make sense to do this if you’re not in it to win a championship. “Again, it’s way too difficult. We put way too much in it, we spend way too much time away from our families, we put our bodies through way too much to be in this to not try to win a championship. Everything that we do is in pursuit of that. “To be able to accomplish that, obviously, it would mean the world to us. The first one was amazing. The boat parade? Pretty sick. I would love to do that again.” Each year that goes by since he was part of the Bucs’ Super Bowl championship following the 2020 season, fewer of his old championship teammates are around. But Godwin has grown close to the new guys that have arrived since 2020. Godwin said it would be cool to help his newer teammates not just win another ring, but to share in the experience. “Baker Mayfield works his ass off,” Godwin began. “I would love for him to be able to experience winning a Super Bowl and the things that come with that. That would be something to see, huh?” The way Godwin busts his tail to be the best he can be, and how that work ethic rubs off, Joe wouldn’t be shocked if the Bucs make a run at that next ring next winter.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/market-value-madness/|Market Value Madness|So one could argue Mike Evans, Chris Godwin and Baker Mayfield will play this season for a combined $40 million under market value. Jason Licht doesn’t even have compromising photos of these guys. The Buccaneers Ring of Honor general manager is killing it with below-market-value contracts. That saved money is paying for a hell of a lot on the Bucs’ roster. Jamel Dean should send each of those guys a Rolex. This is another example of why the Bucs should be in win-now mode in free agency and the 2025 NFL Draft. These financial benefits can’t last forever. Evans is in the final year of his contract. Mayfield could march into Licht’s office after this season and demand justice. Regardless, the Bucs are in a unique situation with three Pro Bowl-level players taking one for the team. It sure does speak to the Bucs’ culture that Licht gets to play with 10 or 15 percent more cap room than other teams because of what’s been crafted inside the walls of One Buc Palace.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/bucs-and-dolphins-swap-linebackers-sort-of/|Bucs And Dolphins Swap Linebackers (Sort Of)|Don’t see this very often. At about the same time, the Bucs lost a linebacker to Miami but the Bucs signed a linebacker from Miami. Per the blistered fingers of Adam Schefter, BSPN NFL guru, former Bucs linebacker K.J. Britt signed with the Dolphins. The Bucs signed Anthony Walker. An eight-year veteran by way of Northwestern, Walker started eight games for his hometown Dolphins last year after stints with Indianapolis and Cleveland. For three years with the Colts and one year with the Browns, Walker was a starting middle linebacker. Walker’s best year in the NFL came in 2019 with the Colts when he had 124 tackles. Britt was exposed last year. In 2023, Britt looked like a solid linebacker. But last year as a full-time starter, he got roasted in the pass game. Joe felt bad for the guy. Britt is a smart dude with the heart of a lion. You put that heart and head into Devin White’s body, you’d have a Hall of Fame player. Joe thinks Britt will make a good coach, a really good coach, someday. He’s just not a quality starting linebacker.

Joe wouldn’t be surprised at all. The last two playcallers were one-and-done. Dave Canales and Liam Coen landed head coaching jobs after their only season as a Bucs offensive coordinator. Granted, Chris Godwin said, that shows the Bucs knows what it is doing but he added when he appeared on NFL Network on Tuesday, don’t forget the role players had in Canales and Coen getting sweet gigs. “I think the guys that we’ve had come through here have [had] enough success to go ahead and get head coaching jobs, right?” Godwin began. “I think it says that that the people that are doing the hiring here are picking the right guys. “But also, the talent that we have in the locker room, [it shows] that we’re performing at a level that makes people want to come and hire your guys.” It seemed from listening to Godwin that he and the rest of the Bucs offense want to go out this year and prove it wasn’t just coaches who guided the Bucs to more NFC South crowns. It was the players, too. Yes, Godwin is motivated to win another Super Bowl.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/bspn-bucs-got-a-bargain-with-chris-godwin/|BSPN: Bucs Got A Bargain With Chris Godwin|The way it’s going for Bucs AC/DC-loving general manager Jason Licht, he’ll have to send his wife to do the dirty work when he next needs a new car. No local dealership will want to negotiate with him for fear of getting taken to the cleaners. In the mind of Seth Walder of BSPN, a man who never met a number he didn’t like, Licht got away with another heist Monday when he got receiver Chris Godwin to re-up. While Walder admits Godwin is not a sure thing — no one has seen him run a route since dislocating his ankle in October — for the price Licht (Mike Greenberg?) got Godwin, it negated any risk in retaining him. The deal: Three years, $66 million ($44 million guaranteed) Grade: A- … Considering Tee Higgins isn’t available, that DK Metcalf cost $30 million per year and a second-round pick and that Davante Adams cost $23 million per year, the Bucs getting Godwin back at this price is a bargain. Having a second playmaker for Baker Mayfield to target beyond Mike Evans is crucial for the health of the Tampa Bay offense. Godwin comes with some risk, of course. He just turned 29 years old and is coming off an ankle injury that limited him to only seven games in 2024. But he’s also coming off his best season since he tore his ACL at the end of the 2021 season, increasing his yards per route run from 1.8 in 2022 and 1.9 in 2023 to 2.5 in a limited sample in 2024. … He was worth bringing back, particularly at this price. Everything hinges on Godwin’s ankle. Joe doesn’t know why Godwin was so secretive about his rehab on Tuesday. Godwin couldn’t even tell Bucs fans if he plans to take the field Week 1? Aside from the ankle, there is no risk with Godwin. The Bucs know this all too well. Godwin’s going to bust his tail, he’s going to be a tremendous teammate and he will be the first-class person the franchise likes to boast is a model citizen.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/ben-bredeson-sees-no-obstacle-in-taking-offense-to-another-level/|Ben Bredeson Sees No Obstacle In Taking Offense To Another Level|Last year the Bucs ranked third in average yards per game at 400 yards (399.6 to be precise). Pretty impressive. But not impressive enough for Ben Bredeson? The Tampa Bay left guard, seeing the Bucs will return all 11 starters from that same offense (provided Chris Godwin is healthy), can envision the offense taking a step forward. “Personally, it’s something I’ve never experienced – having the entire offensive line return let alone the entire offense return,” Bredeson said yesterday. “It’s very exciting. We’re going to have to build this thing back up again – it’s not just going to pick up right where we left off. “We have to build this back up through OTA’s and training camp. With that continuity between the running backs, O-line, [wide] receivers, quarterback, we can really make some strides and hopefully streamline that growing process a little bit faster.” This sounds great and Joe’s not trying to throw cold water on the idea. But remember that new Bucs offensive coordinator Josh Grizzard has never called plays before. Yeah, Joe gets it, he was on Liam Coen’s staff last year. That alone should help Grizzard quite a bit. He knows what and who he’s working with, knows each player’s strengths and weaknesses. Still, Joe thinks that’s putting a lot of undue pressure on a first-time offensive coordinator. It seems unreasonable for Grizzard to guide the Bucs’ offense to a top-two unit. Could the offense be that good? Sure. Remember, the Bucs had three rookie starters last season. Just having experience in the NFL, all three (Bucky Irving, Graham Barton and Jalen McMillan) should be better. If Grizzard does get the offense to improve, it’s a safe bet head coach Todd Bowles will once again be looking for another offensive coordinator next winter.|2025-03-13 00:00:00|297|19|7|Ben Bredeson|Bucs offense aims to improve with returning starters and new coordinator.|4|Comments are mixed, cautious optimism with some concerns raised about coaching staff and performance.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Delusional Intelligence"", ""post"": "" If Grizzard does get the offense to improve, it\u2019s a safe bet head coach Todd Bowles will once again be looking for another offensive coordinator next winter.
