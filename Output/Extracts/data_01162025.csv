https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/baker-mayfield-im-pretty-comfy-in-that-spot/|Baker Mayfield: “I’m Pretty Comfy In That Spot”|A major change seems inevitable for Baker Mayfield and Joe’s not sure Mayfield knows how to handle it successfully. Joe’s referring to Mayfield being a beloved and respected division favorite. Mayfield has spoken previously about loving the underdog role and thriving in it. In 2023, he was Tampa Bay’s shiny toy from a Bucs’ dumpster dive after Tom Brady retired. Some predicted the Bucs to win just a few games (hello, Peter King), and Mayfield largely was viewed as a miracle project as he competed (allegedly) with Kyle Trask for a starting job. Then came a playoff run but another offseason filled with skeptics. All last spring and summer, national pundits gushed over Kirk Cousins and the Falcons, and most put the Bucs around 7 or 8 wins. Instead, the Bucs won 10 and the Falcons were brutal (when they weren’t playing the Bucs). So in a matter of months, Joe is sure the Bucs will be favored to win the NFC South for the 2025 season. That’s foreign territory for Mayfield, especially when you consider what he told Erin Andrews of FOX Sports 12 days ago. “That’s my home. That’s where I’ve come up the whole journey,” Mayfield said of being doubted. “I’m used to that. I’m pretty comfy in that spot. Going back to the early days of not being a big kid getting recruited out of high school. When you’ve dealt with it before, you know exactly what mental place you need to be in, how you have to focus, the determination that comes with it.” Yeah, Mayfield’s Browns were no underdog in 2021 after a surprisingly strong 2020 campaign, but Mayfield got injured in Week 2 of the 2021 season, so it’s unclear how he would have handled that year. Mayfield’s comments to Andrews suggest he’s a stranger to being the favorite. And Joe has little doubt the Bucs and their explosive offense will be projected by many to win 11 games next season after spending in free agency and an intelligent draft. Good luck as a favorite son, Baker! |2025-01-16 17:14:00|344|36|3|Baker Mayfield|Mayfield's shift from underdog to favorite in football career.|7|Mixed sentiments with optimism for the team's potential, concerns about defense, and recognition of Baker's ability.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Buddha"", ""post"": ""They likely will be posted at either 8.5 or 9 wins in Vegas.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/so-whose-play-impressed-todd-bowles/|So Whose Play Impressed Todd Bowles?|Teams change, teams grow and teams take steps back during a season. That’s why the regular season has so much drama. A team could look like the 2020 Bucs in the season opener and end up looking like the 2011 Bucs at season’s end (minus Albert Haynesworth, of course). So what player or players caught Bucs coach Todd Bowles’ eye as far as improving this past season? Bowles was asked on Monday and picked a player from both sides of the ball. “I really like where Luke Goedeke played – I like the way he came back this year and played,” Bowles said of the Bucs’ right tackle. “Even after he got hurt with the concussion, he came back and he made a lot of strides this season, as well.” How about the defensive side? It didn’t surprise Joe that Bowles selected a defensive back and the name didn’t surprise Joe, either. “I thought Christian Izien before he got hurt made great strides and did a lot of things well,” Bowles said. “There [are] a few guys that made strides like that, but those two stand out.” Goedeke became a good right tackle. Good enough that outside of Detroit, the Bucs may have the best pair of tackles in the NFC. Izien? Joe thought he looked sharp all year. He really caught Joe’s eye in training camp. The guy was making play after play, day after day. Along the way, Izien became a plug-and-play guy. He could play nickel, he could play safety, and in an emergency, he could and did play corner. Didn’t embarrass himself there, either. Not bad for an undrafted free agent from Rutgers.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/jason-lichts-been-beating-the-brakes-off-us/|“Jason Licht’s Been Beating The Brakes Off Us”|Joe loves hearing crying out of NFC South cities not named Tampa. That happened Monday when an educated and astute Saints fan (yes, there is such a thing) called former Jets personnel chief and linebackers coach Pat Kirwan on SiriusXM NFL Radio. This disgusted Saints fans moaned about how the Bucs have gotten younger while the Saints have stayed old. And he cried about how Buccaneers Ring of Honor general manager Jason Licht has built up his trenches on both sides of the ball far better than Saints GM Mickey Loomis. The Saints fan also cried about salary cap management and then got to the April extravaganza known as the NFL Draft. “Jason Licht’s been beating the brakes off us in the draft every year. They’ll beat the brakes off us again,” he cried. The fun thing was that Kirwan said he agreed with the caller and then added that, more important, Licht hit a home run with Baker Mayfield and kept winning while digging out of salary cap jail. Then Kirwan issued a bit of a warning to Licht and his bosses known as Team Glazer. “I would hope that they’re smart enough not to do something bad with Todd Bowles,” he said. “Todd Bowles is a tremendous football coach.” Kirwan ranted that the key question for ownership is, “Are the players still believing in the coach?” For Bowles, he said, the answer is a resounding, “Yes.” Joe loves how Licht has been kicking ass for several years. That doesn’t mean every pick is a winner, but Licht certainly is a top-flight GM. Heck, that’s one reason some fans are so mad at Bowles. They’re sure the Bucs had enough talent secured by Licht to win a dozen games and advance deeper into the playoffs.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/todd-bowles-addresses-his-starting-cornerbacks/|Todd Bowles Addresses His Starting Cornerbacks|Do the Bucs have a good tandem of starting outside cornerbacks? Todd Bowles seemed to deliver a simple answer to that question on Tuesday: If you can get them together and healthy. “For the most part they played well,” Bowles told the Buccaneers Radio Network when asked about the 2024 seasons of Jamel Deal and Zyon McCollum. “I think early on, maybe the Denver game, I would say that was not a good ballgame for them. But when they were together, it gives us freedom to play more man [defense] and trying to cover different guys and do a lot of things. Obviously, when they get hurt, then you have to adjust things. You have to change up a little bit. “But when you get them both healthy at the same time, which is tough to do, obviously, you got two good corners.” Well, McCollum started all 17 games (thought he left injured a couple of times), so the health issue surrounded Dean, who has become a new fan punching bag. Dean missed five games and left three games early with injuries, including Sunday’s playoff game. That’s 8 out of 18 games in which Dean was either unavailable or injured. Do the Bucs want to pay more than $10 million to watch Dean battle to stay out of the doctor’s office next year? That’s a subject for another post, though it is a topic on today’s Ira Kaufman Podcast. As for the Bucs’ paltry season total of 7 interceptions, Bowles had frustration in his voice, and he didn’t say his starting corners were exempt from criticism. “Gotta make them happen. You got to go after the plays,” Bowles said. “You got to go after the plays; I thought we were tentative at times. We got to get a lot better going after the football and being hungry for it.” Ira Kaufman Dives Very Deep On Defensive Issues, Fixes & Successes, Talks Todd Bowles Distortions And Realities, Final Washington Feedback, And More|2025-01-16 11:18:00|331|75|5|Todd Bowles|Evaluating starting cornerbacks for the Bucs.|4|Mixed reviews leaning towards pessimism, highlighting concerns about Dean's performance, availability, and contract.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""BuckyBuc"", ""post"": ""it was bad this year"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""16th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""11:24"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""LVMYBUCS"", ""post"": ""Ur blind Mr.Bowles even at his best Dean cant catch a ball unless it hits him right in the chest.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/a-common-denominator-on-bucs-two-big-mistakes/|A Common Denominator On Bucs’ Two Big Mistakes|Joe wrote last week about how much different and intense playoff games are over regular season games. Joe spoke with a couple of Bucs players who had their first taste of playoff action last year and who were mentally ready for a playoff game last weekend. Postseason games really are that much more intense, they told Joe, and even little mistakes are magnified. Each said it’s hard to really grasp the intensity unless someone has already played in a playoff game. For rookies, an intense playoff game is usually an eye-opener, Joe was told. Boy, were they ever right about how much bigger small mistakes are in the playoffs. Take the Bucs on offense Sunday. The botched handoff between Baker Mayfield and wide receiver Jalen McMillan in a four-point game on a jet-sweep from the Bucs-15 turned into a disaster. Washington recovered and later scored a go-ahead touchdown early in the fourth quarter. Then there was Graham Barton’s premature snap that blew up a Bucky Irving run on third-and-one from the Commandos-12. Irving got dropped for a two-yard loss as the early snap caught the Bucs’ offensive line off guard and Bucs coach Todd Bowles kicked a field goal to tie the game. So Mayfield and McMillan screwed up a handoff when it looked like a big play might pop. Then on the next possession, Barton didn’t have the correct snap count. (Yes, Joe knows Barton was trying to catch Washington off guard and draw a penalty — not a dumb idea. Problem was, the zebras didn’t see the penalty.) What do those plays have in common? Rookies. As Joe likes to say, rookies play like rookies because they are rookies.|2025-01-16 10:00:00|281|32|5|Bucs' mistakes spark playoff insight|rookies make costly errors.|5|Mixed sentiment on rookies, optimism for future offense, frustration with coaching and performance issues.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Ryan Smith"", ""post"": ""I still love this rookie class.

Mahomes didnt reach at all he turned and Tyreek was tight in his back pocket, Baker did. Tyreek was running completely parallel with the line of scrimmage, McMillan was not. When KC ran all 6 times their were 2 words that came to mind they were quick and precise. When we ran it Sunday it was semi-quick but precise did not happen. To run a JET sweep 4 things have to happen.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/there-is-a-zero-percent-chance-they-do-what-they-did-last-year/|“Zero Percent Chance They Do What They Did Last Year”|For those hellbent on running Todd Bowles out of town, you may want to skip this next paragraph. Joe is bringing the following to readers with zero dog in the fight. Or cat. Or mouse. Or hamster. Or any other four-legged furry creature. What Joe has heard both in and outside of One Buc Palace is that Todd Bowles will be the 2025 Bucs head coach. If Joe heard differently, Joe would have different intel for you. Over at Yahoo!, long-time football writer and podcaster Matt Harmon doesn’t know if Bowles should stay or go. What Harmon does know is that if the Bucs want to make more postseason appearances and runs at a Super Bowl, then the Bucs cannot allow savvy offensive coordinator Liam Coen to escape. Harmon foresees disaster if Coen gets away and the Bucs will rue the day for years to come. “And let me say this: There is a zero percent chance they do what they did last year which is have to wave goodbye to their playcaller and then upgrade, which is what they did, right?” Harmon said. “[Dave] Canales goes to coach the Panthers and they bring in [Liam] Coen. … “ To stop the merry-go-round of offensive coordinators and keep the Bucs on an upward trajectory, Harmon said the Bucs must do whatever it takes to keep Coen. “I just think there is no chance they can let him out of the building,” Harmon said. Still, Harmon says it is distasteful if not irresponsible for folks to have the kneejerk reaction to can Bowles in order to keep Coen. Harmon added he has no clue if Coen will ever be as good of a head coach as Bowles. “It is easy for me to sit here in my stupid office with no consequences to say, ‘Well, just fire Todd Bowles and promote Liam Coen,” Harmon said. “I have no idea if Liam Coen is going to be a good head coach! “Maybe he is going to go out there and eff up timeouts and game management just like Todd Bowles does! I have no idea. That is a complete unknown to me. “I don’t know, 96 maybe 97 percent of people doing podcasts also have no idea.” If Bucs fans, in March of 2022, would have been told the team would win the division the next three seasons, and that in 2023 and 2024 the team not only would improve its regular season record each season but would also have a new franchise quarterback with a stellar offense, not one fan would have complained. Well, Bowles has delivered that. And for that, some want his head on a platter. In a perfect world, Team Glazer would match or exceed whatever salary Coen might get from another team to be a head coach, and when Bowles retires, Coen is in position to take over. Get that taken care of so the Bucs can put their complete and total focus on fixing their terribly porous pass defense.  |2025-01-16 07:00:00|503|73|4|Todd Bowles|Bowles’ future uncertain|2|Mixed sentiment with frustrations about the defense and uncertainty about coaching decisions.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""JBBUCS_06"", ""post"": ""Agreed"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""16th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""7:05"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""MarkV"", ""post"": ""Let\u2019s compromise and just insist on a new defensive coordinator.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/glazer-ownership-ride-began-30-years-ago-today/|Glazer Ownership Ride Began 30 Years Ago Today|BY IRA KAUFMAN They said he was nuts. On this day 30 years ago, Malcom Glazer coughed up nearly $200 million to purchase the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. For some, that was considered an outrageous amount to spend on a franchise that hadn’t been to the postseason in 12 years. Tampa Stadium was antiquated and half-empty while the Bucs were annual strangers to prime-time games. Some fans that did show up in previous years came adorned with bags over their heads to protest the team’s irrelevance and attempt to shame former owner Hugh Culverhouse, who was viewed as frugal and indifferent. Bill Clinton was in the Oval Office and “Dumb and Dumber” ruled at the box office. The Allman Brothers, Janis Joplin and Led Zeppelin were just inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. O.J.’s murder trial had just begun and George W. Bush was about to be sworn in as Governor of Texas. Buc supporters didn’t know it at the time, but things would change in a hurry. A year later, the Glazers made a fateful coaching change, hiring Tony Dungy, who now boasts a bust in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Through all the ups and downs, Tampa Bay’s ownership has remained steady, despite the passing of Malcolm Glazer in 2014. The franchise is now worth an estimated $5.4 billion and the Glazers have proven to be very active in the community with an array of charitable endeavors. “These 30 years have definitely gone by fast,” says co-chairman Joel Glazer. “I don’t quite know where the time has gone. I’ve always felt the key to success is stability and continuity. There are so many factors in sports that go into winning — to have that stability underpins all chances of success.” Along the way, the Glazers earned the respect of fellow owners. The family has steadily raised its profile in league circles, serving on key committees while committing funds for improvements to Raymond James Stadium. “The Glazers have been a tremendous asset to the NFL and the Tampa Bay community for three decades,” says Falcons owner Arthur Blank, a division rival since entering the league in 2002. “The success of the Buccaneers on the field and the team’s positive impact in their community are unmistakable and the Glazers have also been an important voice in the growth and strength of the NFL.” Both of Tampa Bay’s Super Bowl victories have come under the stewardship of the Glazers, who tend to keep a low profile. In 2005, the Glazers also purchased Manchester United, a historic soccer franchise that has had mixed success in the Premier League under their ownership tenure. Joel Glazer says he has attended every Buc game, home or away, during the regular season and playoffs since 1995. He and his five siblings can often be seen welcoming Buc players into the locker room after a victory. “We have zero regrets about owning the team,” he says. “Zero point zero. It’s been an unbelievable experience. At the end of the day, the greatest part of the whole thing is when you’re winning and the joy it brings to the community and our fans. There’s no more rewarding feeling than that.” Beginning in 1997, the Bucs made the playoffs seven times in 11 years. The 2002 club, guided by new head coach Jon Gruden, routed the Raiders in the Super Bowl as the Glazers gathered jubilantly on a midfield podium for the presentation of the Vince Lombardi Trophy. But starting in 2008, Buc supporters endured a 12-year playoff drought that tested their patience. “We’ve got the best fans in the world,” Joel Glazer says. “They’re unbelievable. They’re with our team through thick and thin. They love the Buccaneers and there’s a special connection.” The Glazers fired six coaches, including Dungy and Gruden, before Bruce Arians arrived in 2019. Another Vince Lombardi Trophy would soon follow with Tom Brady under center. The team has been competitive with Todd Bowles on the sidelines the past three years. “They do things the right way and represent the best of what we all hope these franchises can be in the league and for the fans,” Blank says. “Personally, I’ll always be grateful to Malcolm as he was the first owner to reach out and offer advice and perspective in a welcoming spirit when I bought the Falcons. They have always been great partners to me and the rest of the league.” The Glazers recently commissioned a film crew to chronicle the first 50 years of a franchise that began play in 1976. It’s a massive, expensive project that includes dozens of interviews with key figures, including current ownership. The sprawling documentary is expected to be ready by the summer, debuting in a local movie theater. The lengthy list of fired coaches suggests the Glazers have made their share of mistakes along the way. Following the 2002 championship season, they were unable to repair the rift between Gruden and former GM Rich McKay. In between McKay’s departure and the arrival of Jason Licht in 2014, the executive suite appeared to be in disarray. Besides winning two Super Bowls, the Glazers oversaw the construction of Raymond James Stadium, ushered in lavish new headquarters for the franchise and signed off on a long-overdue indoor facility. These past three decades have offered Joel Glazer a front-row seat for the thrill ride and despair that comes with owning an NFL franchise. Would Buc fans prefer a Jerry Jones, who routinely usurps the authority of the head coach in Big D, or Jets owner Woody Johnson, clueless about building a winning organization? The 2024 Buc season just ended in disappointing fashion with an opening-round playoff exit, yet ownership is hardly discouraged. “I’m very excited about our future,” Glazer says. “We have a young core of good players — and that’s the key to growing.” |2025-01-16 05:00:00|978|20|8|Glazer Ownership|From challenging beginnings to successful long-term ownership of Buccaneers.|5|Varied opinions on the Glazers, ranging from very positive to questioning their impact.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Kenton Smith"", ""post"": ""There are good rich people and good poor people.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/bucs-beating-bucs-7/|Bucs Beating Bucs|Bucs Super Bowl-winning coach Bucco Bruce Arians often used a now-famous phrase in his first Tampa Bay season when the team almost weekly did something dumb. “Bucs beating Bucs,” Arians used to say. Bucco Bruce was at the playoff game Sunday night. And after the Bucs lost a tough, close game, Joe has to believe Arians mumbled that phrase to himself once or twice. Six-time Super Bowl-winning coach Bill Belichick had a similar thought about that game, shared during his regular appearance on “The Pat McAfee Show.” Belichick said the Bucs have to feel horrible because the Commandos didn’t so much to win; the Bucs beat the Bucs. Former Packers linebacker A.J. Hawk — in one of his rare moments on the show when he wasn’t staring into a camera and smoking a cigar — asked Belichick if he saw dumb mistakes that hurt teams last weekend. Hawk noted most coaches beg players, once into the playoffs, not to make silly unforced mistakes and say “Don’t beat yourself.” “A couple of these teams have to feel terrible,” Belichick replied. “Tampa, they fumble a handoff on a jet sweep-action play. That really didn’t have anything to do with the defense. Then they [butcher] another short-yardage play and screw up the handoff and get stopped and get held to a field goal. “That didn’t have anything to do with Washington’s defense. It was just bad football.” Belichick is right. Neither play happened because of spectacular play made by a Commandos defender. The Bucs’ effed up very simple, run-of-the-mill plays they otherwise execute dozens of times a game. Losing the way the Bucs did, Belichick said, just eats away at coaches. “Those are the kind of plays you look back on when your season ends that you say, ‘We really messed those up,’ Belichick said. “… Those kind of plays you feel like you beat yourself. They are hard to overcome when your season ends that way.” That’s “handing the game away,” he added. That’s sort of what happened on the jet-sweep fumble. You know, like what Arians said.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/you-reevaluate-everything/|“You Reevaluate Everything”|This may be a surprise to some — it is to Joe only because Joe is like, “Damn, that soon?” In six weeks, Joe will be freezing his tail off in the heart of the Midwest for a week at the combine in downtown Indianapolis, which is basically the NFL’s winter festival. Anybody who is anyone is there. Owners (some), general managers, most head coaches, both NFL and college, scouts up the ying-yang, agents all over the place and, of course, college players who are entering the draft. By the time the combine arrives, most NFL teams will already have a good idea of their priorities in free agency and the draft. And at the combine, team representatives (cough, cough) and agents start to mold the general frameworks of offers, even though technically that’s supposed to be a no-no. So what will the Bucs be looking at? Bucs coach Todd Bowles was asked specifically this week if he would reevaluate his training and practice regimen in the wake of so many key player injuries this season. Bowles replied that nothing about the team is spared from evaluations. “Offseason, you reevaluate everything,” Bowles said. “There’s nothing that goes unturned in the offseason. “Again, it’s too early to say everything that we’re going to evaluate, but we’re going to evaluate everything.” Well, Joe doesn’t pull seven figures like an NFL coach. And Joe does not have 24/7 access to One Buc Palace or the players on a daily basis. But even Joe can tell what element of the team needs a laser-focused examination. What exactly is wrong with this pass defense and how can the Bucs fix it? Do the Bucs just need new players? Do they need new coaches? Do they need to run different formations other than a 34 defense? Do they blitz too much? Is it all of the above or some of each? (Don’t get Joe started on an edge rush. Joe feels like a dog that has barked at the moon each night for two months straight and has finally run out of gas. Right now Joe is in a depressed, exhausted state thinking a proven edge rusher simply will not happen. If it was going to happen, it would have happened by now. It’s like pining daily for Kate Upton and then after two years of constant wooing, stretching the boundaries of stalking, you realize it ain’t gonna happen. Yeah Bucs, you wore Joe out. #WhiteFlagRaised) It’s been two years running that the Bucs have had a horrid pass defense. And the Bucs added talent in the secondary last year and struck some gold with Zyon McCollum. So Joe isn’t fully convinced it’s just personnel that is dragging the defense down. As Joe informed readers this week, in 2023. the five teams that finished with the bottom-five passing yards allowed per game have since either had new head coaches and/or new defensive coordinators. All but the Bucs. And those four teams finished no worse than 20th in passing yards allowed per game in 2024. The Bucs, like in 2023, finished 28th in that category in 2024. Something ain’t right with this pass defense. That is what the Bucs need to study with a microscope.|2025-01-16 00:00:00|538|20|5|The Bucs|Introspective evaluation of pass defense performance at NFL combine.|3|Mixed opinions on defensive performance and coaching changes.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""BallHawk75"", ""post"": ""\u201cJust gotta get better\u201d \u2013 The Mensa candidate "", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""16th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""12:08"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""August 1976 Buc"", ""post"": ""For years now, Carlton Davis was hurt way to much, Dean also has missed a ton of games over the years, this year Winfield was out most of the time, and many others banged up.
