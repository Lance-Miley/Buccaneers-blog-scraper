https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/different-breed-tristan-wirfs-buccaneers-blog-ira-kaufman/|A Different Breed|BY IRA KAUFMAN If sports reveals character, the Buccaneers stand proud and tall. Tampa Bay is in the process of digging out of a December hole for the second consecutive season, a testament to the grit and mental toughness of a young roster that keeps fighting. A 4-7 getaway appeared to doom the 2023 Bucs before they closed with a 5-1 stretch that lifted Tampa Bay to its fourth straight playoff berth. That team lost 6-of-7 at one point and the walls were closing in on Todd Bowles until a late-season turnaround that had to impress the Glazers. This season’s comeback story from a 4-6 start is equally compelling. Four consecutive losses, many in excruciating fashion, left Tampa Bay far behind Atlanta atop the NFC South. The bye week proved to be a tonic and the Bucs have ripped off three wins in a row heading into Sunday’s matchup against the Chargers. “First place feels good,” says Tristan Wirfs, “but it’s one thing getting there and another thing staying there. We know what it takes. We’ve been there before. The same thing happened to us last year.” Then Wirfs revealed the depths of Tampa Bay’s despair last year as the season was slipping away. “I remember losing four in a row — it was a dark time for sure,” he said. “It was frustrating and challenging, but nobody wavered. We’ve been in some ruts with Coach Bowles, but he has brought us out of them. He’s very stoic, and I love it. I can get him to crack a smile every once in a while. I can get him going.” The Bucs are now heavy favorites to win the division, but the margin for error is slim. The Chargers are a solid team led by a stellar defense and Atlanta is a 3 1/2 point favorite to beat the Raiders on Monday night, so the Falcons could climb back on top of the division by virtue of their tie-breaker advantage. Some NFL teams tend to fold when things go wrong. Instead, the Bucs grow tighter and fight through the adversity. “I like the fact we stay together as a unit,” says Jamel Dean. “I’m very proud of our young guys stepping up.” Overcoming tough times requires veteran leadership — and the Bucs have the right components in place. Wirfs, Lavonte David, Vita Vea and Mike Evans know what it’s like to go through this gauntlet and come out the other side. Even the most passionate of Bowles’ skeptics have to acknowledge that his steady hand promotes a sense of calm through the storm. In the process, the Bucs have established an identity as a physical team. In the past nine games, Tampa Bay has averaged 157 yards on the ground. Not too shabby for a run game that ranked last in 2022 and 2023. “We just got 150 (152) on the ground again,” Wirfs said. “That’s all we’ve got to do, keep the running game going and we’ll be O.K.” The Bucs stand in stark contrast to some franchises who can’t find the path out of a death spiral. Jacksonville opened the year 0-4 and never recovered. The Raiders started 2-2 and have now lost nine in a row. The Giants stood 2-3 before a current 8-game losing streak that has them vying for the No. 1 pick in the draft. Chicago’s season appeared promising at 4-2. Now the Bears have dropped seven straight and a coaching change appears likely. The Bucs are a different breed. Instead of drifting apart, Tampa Bay players and coaches block the outside noise and grow tighter during tough times. That’s an admirable quality ownership can’t hep but notice. Out of the darkness described by Wirfs, the Bucs find a way to play meaningful games in December. As any Tampa Bay fan will tell you, that hasn’t always been the case. Character counts — and there’s no shortage of it at One Buc Place. |2024-12-12 15:11:00|659|23|5|A Different Breed|Bucs overcoming adversity and showing resilience in NFL season.|4|Mixed responses, leaning towards optimism but with some skepticism and criticism.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Anthony"", ""post"": ""I dont know if this stuff is scripted or what\u2026. most predicted the bucs have the 4 game skid\u2026 then were mad at bowles when it happened.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/past-two-seasons-bucs-owned-december-and-january/|Todd Bowles And Bucs Own December And January|Here’s one for you: Since 2023, the Bucs are not a team others want to play when football counts. Bucs coach Todd Bowles has said the real NFL season begins in December. There, including January games, the Bucs are pretty damn good. The Bucs are 7-1 in December and January in the regular season under Bowles. Throw in playoff games and the Bucs are 8-3. Popular national sports TV and radio personality Adam Schein brought up this topic on his show “Schein on Sports” yesterday when he welcomed Bucs AC/DC-loving general manager Jason Licht on the air. “Schein on Sports” airs on the “Mad Dog Radio” channel exclusively on SiriusXM. Licht said the reason for such a dominant last two months is largely because of one man: Todd Bowles. “I will start with the head coach, Todd,” Licht began. “Unwavering attitude and just the way he leads the team. And we’ve been through some tough times over the past couple of years. “Last year we were sitting at 4-7 and came back to go to the divisional game. This year? We lost two of our best players in the same game, Mike [Evans] and Chris [Godwin], and now we have a slew of injuries on defense. We may be playing with our fifth inside linebacker and fourth safety this week. “But [injuries have] never been used as an excuse by our head coach or our players.” Licht later summed up the key trait explainig why the Bucs have played so well late in seasons. “It is the character of the team,” Licht said. He cited team leaders such as Lavonte David and Antoine Winfield, among others, who help keep their teammates dialed in. Ultimately, Licht said, the credit begins with Bowles. “Todd preaches to the team every day that December and January football is when it matters,” Licht said. “That is a testament to our coach and the way that he’s been leading our team.” Joe remembers last year when the Bucs lost six of seven games and appeared doomed, only to rally and scare the Lions in the divisional round of the playoffs. Then Bucs offensive coordinator Dave Canales was asked why the team, losing six of seven, didn’t fold or panic. Canales quickly pointed to Bowles. Canales noted Bowles’ even-keeled demeanor and how he never gets rattled rubbed off on the team. Put your head down and work. Call it the calm in the storm.|2024-12-12 12:33:00|407|29|8|Todd Bowles|Bucs excel in December and January.|6|Mixed sentiments on Bowles, with recognition of improvement potential and historical patterns.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""PSL Bob"", ""post"": ""Now, if we can just get 3 more wins. 4 would be nice, but I think 3 should do it."", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""12th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""12:43"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Bucswin!"", ""post"": ""I\u2019ll take it.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/nervous-tristan-wirfs/|“Nervous” Tristan Wirfs|So the Bucs came out of halftime Sunday after a rousing Lavonte David speech and allowed one of the longest drives in the NFL this season. Thankfully, the 16-play Raiders march ended with a red zone interception by Tykee Smith. It could have ended with a 17-14 Raiders lead and a stiff Bucs offense. Joe means “stiff” as in ice cold on the bench after an enormous break after halftime. Left tackle Tristan Wirfs said the long break got in his head on the bench. “I better stand up. I better shake a leg or something,” Wirfs said he thought as the drive marched on. “Yeah, because like sometimes coming out of halftime and having a long drive and kind of sitting there, you’re like, ‘Oooh, stiffening up a little bit.’ … But yeah, get a little nervous there.” Interestingly, the Bucs had a rough drive (under 3 minutes) that was short-circuited by a Luke Goedeke false start. Graham Barton also was called for holding on 3rd-and-long but the penalty was declined. As Wirfs noted, at least the weather was warm.|2024-12-12 12:18:00|181|22|4|Tristan Wirfs|Bucs struggle defensively but make crucial interceptions during game.|3|Mixed sentiments with blame on Mayfield, injuries, penalties, and dissatisfaction with officiating and team.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""drdneastup"", ""post"": ""Pre snap penalties always seem to hurt the Bucs the worst."", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""12th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""12:30"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Gipper"", ""post"": ""That 9.5 minute drive revealed everything that has been wrong with the defense all year.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/its-only-a-good-feeling-for-one-week/|“It’s Only A Good Feeling For One Week”|Hey, what happened to the 24-hour rule? That’s an unwritten covenant within most NFL teams. Don’t cry about a win for more than one day and don’t think about a victory beyond 24 hours. A day after a game, it’s all business and no feelings. So, Joe was a little surprised to hear Todd Bowles say of Sunday’s win against the Raiders to sieze first place in the NFC South, “It’s only a good feeling for one week.” Man, it’s hard to believe that steady Bowles seemed to drift from his always-even path to acknowledge a feeling beyond a day after a game. The comments came on Bowles’ Buccaneers Radio Network radio show. Joe thinks the comment speaks to the great relief within the Bucs’ organization. The coffee tastes the better. Nagging injuries don’t hurt as much. The empty seats at The Licht House are less offensive. “The Bucs Life” is far better when the team controls its destiny and can put the painful two losses to the Falcons this season in the rear view mirror. It’s only a good feeling for one week.|2024-12-12 08:30:00|184|13|7|Joe|Bowles acknowledges fleeting joy after Bucs' victory.|4|Mixed sentiments with some optimism but overall cautious and slightly pessimistic tone.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""HC Grover"", ""post"": ""Confidence is good.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/chargers-qb-justin-herbert-has-another-sprained-ankle/|Chargers QB Justin Herbert Has Another Sprained Ankle|Joe is a big Justin Herbert fan. But the Chargers star quarterback isn’t having a great year. He’s in a smashmouth offense and he’s battled a sprained ankle since early in the season. He has another one now. Per Thuc Nhi Nguyen of the Los Angeles Times, Herbert got beat up by the Chiefs on Sunday. He suffered a sprained left ankle in the first quarter and had to sit out a play in the second quarter when he took a shot to the left thigh. Herbert told the City of Angels pen and mic club yesterday his right ankle sprain suffered earlier in the year was more painful. Trainers decided to play it safe and keep him out of practice yesterday. The Chargers, as a result of Herbert’s injuries, limited his runs in the second half against the Chiefs, per Nguyen. New Chargers coach Jim Harbaugh said he fully expects Herbert to face the Bucs because he is a tough guy and Harbaugh said he’s seen Herbert fight through tougher injuries. The way the Bucs’ edge rush (what edge rush?) frustrates Joe to the point Joe might punch a hole in the wall of his Los Angeles hotel room, Joe would think a hobbled Herbert would help the Bucs. But outside of Calijah Kancey and Vita Vea, the Bucs can’t sack a lawn chair. So it really doesn’t matter if Herbert is out there on crutches. Joe would think that with a sore wheel (two sore wheels?), Herbert may lose some accuracy.|2024-12-12 08:20:00|253|34|3|Justin Herbert|Herbert suffers sprained ankle|3|Some pessimism due to concerns about Bucs' defense and lack of pass rush.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Marky Mark"", ""post"": ""Make  him run and roll out.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/football-genius-tykee-smith/|Football Genius Tykee Smith|Back in the spring and summer, Todd Bowles always seemed to speak with a smile and reverence in his voice when mentioning rookie third-round pick Tykee Smith. The nickel cornerback/safety out of the University of Georgia also impressed the Bucs’ front office for his football aptitude prior to the draft. And some of that love was shown via official Buccaneers video. Smith endured a freakish knee bruise prior to the Bucs-49ers game on Nov. 10. It cost him three games. He returned Sunday against the Raiders and played well with a key red zone interception. That had Bowles speaking with great respect and appreciation again. “It’s rare because he’s a very intelligent football player. Not many rookies take mental reps on the side, whether you’re hurt or not in, and still go out there and execute and understand the game plan,” Bowles said. “And he’s one of the few guys that can do that.” Bowles called Smith “huge” for also playing safety on Sunday in addition to nickel. All Joe can do is applaud. What a third-round pick he’s been so far. Smith has proven to be a strong tackler with a knack for forcing fumbles. Can he keep it up and avoid injuries? That’s probably a key to the Bucs’ chances for a postseason victory.|2024-12-12 08:20:00|216|14|8|Tykee Smith|Impressive rookie cornerback/safety earning respect with intelligence and performance.|8|Positive sentiment towards draft picks and players, hopeful for success and playoff experience.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""infomeplease"", ""post"": ""TS23 is a playmaker!

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/you-dont-grade-well-when-you-have-two-interceptions/|“You Don’t Grade Well When You Have Two Interceptions”|The Bucs franchise quarterback got a little irked at the end of his postgame news conference on Sunday.  The final question of the slightly longer than usual session was a reporter asking Baker Mayfield how he feels when he gets to the sideline after an interception. “Pissed off. Pissed off,” Mayfield replied. And that ended the news conference. Mayfield then re-entered the locker room and expressed some annoyance about the question to a teammate. Yes, the Bucs won and Mayfield is a winner as a Buccaneer, but there’s no cheerleading for quarterback play when there are two interceptions in game. That was Todd Bowles’ message on his official team radio show this week, not Joe’s message. “Grade-wise, you don’t grade well when you have two interceptions. Regardless of whether you win or lose, you don’t grade well when you have two interceptions,” Bowles said of Mayfield’s game against the Raiders. “But, we’re not going to play perfect football; it’s not made to be played perfect. But we play winning football, and he plays winning football.” Joe had to chuckle hearing that. Joe can only imagine what Bowles thought of Jameis Winston and his 30 interceptions back in the 16-game 2019 season. Bowles also critiqued the four sacks of Mayfield on Sunday and pointed a pinkie toward his QB. “I thought two of them were coverage sacks,” Bowles said. “One of them they got back there, one time nobody was open. You know, trying to make things happen, you got to at least throw the ball away or find the outlet.” Joe likes how Bowles loves Mayfield and is in his corner but isn’t afraid to be real publicly about the Bucs’ quarterback play. Mayfield has the second-most interceptions in the NFL this season with 13, two less than Falcons savior Kirk Cousins.|2024-12-12 08:10:00|302|28|4|Baker Mayfield|Mayfield criticized for interceptions despite Buccaneers' win.|5|Mixed sentiments with some defending Baker Mayfield and others criticizing him, resulting in balance.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Marky Mark"", ""post"": ""Eat the swedish pouches in the locker room."", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""12th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""8:30"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""RVATom"", ""post"": ""Ya have to wonder why the question?

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/new-bucs-ilb-deion-jones-a-forgotten-bucs-hero/|New Bucs ILB Deion Jones A Forgotten Bucs Hero?|It was inching toward the end of the 2019 season. It was the first season with Bucco Bruce Arians as coach. Arians, the quarterback whisperer, was hired specifically to see if he could save America’s Quarterback, Mr. Entertainment, Pro Bowler Jameis Winston. In Week 15, the Bucs clobbered the Lions in Detroit. Jameis threw four touchdown passes. With Jameis in a contract year, it looked as if the Arians experiment worked. Jameis was the franchise quarterback. That lasted a week. In the final two games of the season, Jameis threw six picks and the Bucs went 0-2 to finish 7-9. Arians has since said those final two games of 2019 forced the Bucs to look behind Door No. 2. The final straw for Arians was in the final game against the Dixie Chicks. Jameis threw a pick-six to Deion Jones in overtime. The Bucs looked behind Door No. 2 and found Tom Brady. Some 13 months later, in their own crib, the Bucs slobbered all over the Vince Lombardi Trophy. Joe brings this up because the Bucs signed Jones to the practice squad. Yesterday, Bucs coach Todd Bowles all but promised Jones will see playing time at linebacker because the Bucs are beyond thin there. So it has come full circle.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/todd-bowles-overachieved/|Ian Beckles: Todd Bowles “Overachieved”|Reunited and it feels so good. A pair of former local sports radio giants who used to unite to bring Tampa Bay area listeners quality radio are Jay Recher and Ian Beckles. Radio is oftne a dirty business and neither guy is now fully employed in the business. That doesn’t mean the two cannot link up and provide quality content to the masses. Recher launched a podcast and he invited Beckles to join him to talk Bucs in sort of a reunion. There, the discussion was about whether Bucs coach Todd Bowles gets enough credit for always finding a way to get the Bucs to the playoffs. Beckles said he doesn’t know of another NFL coach who has “overachieved” like Bowles has with the Bucs the past two years, and perhaps this year. “I don’t know if there is a coach who has overachieved more than Todd Bowles in the last few years,” Beckles said. This year is another example, Beckles noted. “Every one of our stars go down,” the former Bucs starting guard said. “Every one of our stars — both receivers went down. We’re still here. “Both of our safeties go down. We’re still here. “The great Joe Tryon-Shoyinka goes down. And we’re still here.” Joe would have added Tristan Wirfs, too. And Jamel Dean. (Rag on Dean if you wish. But when he got hurt in New Orleans and was placed on injured reserve, the Bucs went on a four-game tailspin. With him back in the lineup, the Bucs are 3-0.) Beckles doesn’t think the Bucs roster is all that. So with the Bucs’ injuries, most coaches would put their tail between their legs and lose, he said. Beckles has a good point. When other teams would panic and fold their tents, the Bucs fight back and find a way.|2024-12-12 03:45:00|303|44|8|Ian Beckles|Former radio hosts praise Bucs coach Todd Bowles' resilience.|6|Views on Todd Bowles are mixed, with criticisms of defense and coaching decisions.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""KnoxvilleBuc"", ""post"": ""Hate to admit it but it\u2019s a valid point.

He’d like more players to emulate Evans. “Yeah, he was into it,” Bowles said Wednesday. “He was into it and yelling at defensive guys – offensive guys, defensive guys, that’s what you want. “This is not church here, we’re not going to be standing there getting ready to sing a song. We do a very good job – the guys do a very good job of holding people accountable when they need it.” Joe would like to see more of this. And would love to hear of stories like this in practice. Yeah, Joe knows periodically Lavonte Davis will speak up — like he did at halftime. Like Bowles said, it ought to be more players holding their teammates to high standards, not just David and Evans.|2024-12-12 00:00:00|183|23|7|Todd Bowles|Bowles encourages passionate play among team members.|2|Mixed sentiment with criticism of Dean and Evans, but praise for Lavonte and no divas.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""DaivPare"", ""post"": ""Has anyone asked coach what he thought of Dean\u2019s double whiff especially in a 4th down situation, and what coach is doing to correct Dean from doing it again?
