https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/jason-licht-and-lavonte-david/|Jason Licht And Lavonte David|This week at the combine in Indianapolis, Bucs AC/DC-loving general manager Jason Licht made it crystal clear he and the Bucs would love to have franchise icon Lavonte David back at linebacker. But Licht also noted he and Todd Bowles must look out for the good of the franchise. They can’t just ignore linebacker with the hope that David returns. How the Bucs plan to address linebacker, with or without David, is unclear. But both Licht and Bowles noted that inside linebacker is a focus of their research monitoring prospects in  interviews and workouts. Joe, mostly joking, has mentioned that Combine Week is also the illegal tampering period. Agents are thick as flies in downtown Indianapolis and it is very common to see them wandering the hallways of the Indiana Convention Center, the beehive of the combine, as well as the nighttime haunts and eateries that dot downtown. So it is virtually impossible for a team executive not to cross paths with agents unless the guy never leaves his hotel room. In fact, the framework of trades and future signings are often established this week. (For example, Licht’s greatest heist, his theft of Jason Pierre-Paul from the Giants, had its seeds planted at the 2018 combine). Per NFL insider Josina Anderson, Licht met with David’s agent this week and Anderson learned Licht told David’s agent to take his time making a decision whether to play or retire. The Bucs’ door is always open. … I’m told “it was a positive conversation.” My understanding is that the #Bucs are still willing to give David ample time if necessary to make a decision on still playing the game. Additionally, other teams are checking on David’s potential interest in playing elsewhere beyond Tampa Bay. Joe would be floored if David decided to play elsewhere. Especially after Bowles told the Tampa Bay pen and mic club earlier this week that David was very happy with Bowles bringing back Mike Caldwell as inside linebackers coach. As the clock ticks towards the draft — a long way away, still — Joe has the hunch that Jihaad Campbell just may be in the Bucs’ sharp focus.|2025-02-28 10:21:00|359|37|5|Jason Licht And Lavonte David|Bucs monitor linebacker situation at the NFL combine.|5|Mixed opinions on Lavonte David's value, need for linebackers, and draft strategies.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Defense Rules"", ""post"": ""Joe \u2026 \u2018As the clock ticks towards the draft \u2014 a long way away, still \u2014 Joe has the hunch that Jihaad Campbell just may be in the Bucs\u2019 sharp focus.\u2019"", ""post_time"": [""February"", ""28th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""10:33"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Baker Bowl"", ""post"": ""Joe and others tell me if I am off base \u2013"", ""post_time"": [""February"", ""28th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""10:42"", ""am""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""Baker Bowl"", ""post"": ""Zack Baun/ Nick Bolton are also interesting options should we have some extra cash lying around"", ""post_time"": [""February"", ""28th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""10:44"", ""am""]}, ""commenter3"": {""username"": ""WilieG"", ""post"": ""The Bucs need a couple of linebackers if LVD leaves.

Wester turns 23 next month and first played for Florida Atlantic before transferring to Colorado where Bucs legend Warren Sapp, a Colorado assistant coach, has been mentoring him, Wester told media at the NFL Scouting Combine today. JoeBucsFan.com draft guru Sean Sullivan followed up with a question to Wester about his fearless style. Wester is known for playing without regard for his small size, 5-9, 175 pounds. Wester said he’s fearless on the field because “I grew up in the hood” and he spent his youth playing against bigger people. He mentioned the “hood” a couple of times and said it shaped his play. Sullivan says Wester definitely is third-day draft pick (fourth or fifth round?), and Joe knows the Bucs sure could use a shot in the arm at punt returner.|2025-02-28 10:16:00|150|23|6|LaJohntay Wester|Electric returner LaJohntay Wester shaped by upbringing in the hood.|4|Mixed sentiments with skepticism, hopes, concerns, and support for a draft pick.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""FilthyAnimal"", ""post"": ""I don\u2019t see us going for a WR later in the draft.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/does-raiders-move-put-chris-godwin-in-play-for-vegas/|Does Raiders-Rams Move Put Chris Godwin In Play For Vegas?|So the buzz today at the NFL Scouting Combine surrounds the Raiders, Matt Stafford and the Rams nearing a trade. Apparently, per the Las Vegas Review-Journal, significant progress has been made. UPDATE 1:55 p.m. — The Rams will re-negotiate Matthew Stafford’s contract and he’ll remain in Los Angeles. That brings Joe to the Raiders’ need for receivers and the Vegas brass being very familiar with the all-around greatness of pending Bucs free agent Chris Godwin. That would be Raiders executives Tom Brady and the John Spytek, the former Bucs assistant GM. The Raiders also have a ton of salary cap room. Godwin is recovering from a dislocated ankle, a major injury, and the Bucs need to make a decision on him in 12 short days, when Godwin officially will be free of a contract. But the Bucs aren’t desperate to drop a bunch of money on an injured player, though Godwin is a favorite son and nobody in Tampa wants to bet against him. The Raiders may also want Godwin for culture reasons as they look to reshape the team under new head coach Pete Carroll. One could argue Godwin wouldn’t go where there was no legit quarterback. Vegas may no longer be in that category next week.|2025-02-28 09:22:00|208|25|6|Chris Godwin|Raiders potentially interested in signing Chris Godwin from Bucs.|3|Mixed sentiments on Godwin's future, uncertainty about teams, some optimism about Bucs retaining him.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Rastaferian Jenkins"", ""post"": ""Not happening.

At the NFL Scouting Combine this week in Indianapolis, where Joe continues to patrol, Buccaneers general manager Jason Licht seemingly will tell anyone that will listen that he has no plan to deviate from his current formula. That means nail the draft, find deals in free agency (and what a steal Baker Mayfield and Ben Bredeson were), and improve the Bucs’ line of credit (aka salary cap) while still winning games and improving. And yes, Licht thinks the Bucs were better last year than they were in 2023, so he told Joe. “I kind of feel like we’re in a sweet spot here and manage things correctly and don’t do anything stupid with the cap or give up a whole bunch of picks for the future, I think we can continue to do this and be in a place where we’re knocking on the door and finally kick it down,” Licht told SiriusXM NFL radio. Joe italicized “stupid” because Licht emphasized “stupid.” Joe’s removing the Bucs from the Myles Garrett chatter and any other potential trade that involves a ton of draft capital. That’s just how it is when your team has proven draft picks across the board are valuable. Coughing up a third-round pick and a late-round pick for edge rusher Harold Landry continues to smell like a deal Joe finds pleasing and plausible.|2025-02-28 07:57:00|254|45|7|Jason Licht|Bucs cautious for future success without risky moves.|4|Mixed sentiment with concerns about pass rush, draft strategy, and trust in the GM.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Jeffs grandpa"", ""post"": ""Dean and a 4th for Laundry and a 6th sounds great to me"", ""post_time"": [""February"", ""28th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""8:07"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Bubby"", ""post"": ""Did anyone pickup the guy we signed last year that never showed up?

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/jamel-dean-situation-sounds-unsettled/|Jamel Dean Situation Sounds Unsettled|Is Jamel Dean on solid footing with the Bucs as free agency looms? Bucs AC/DC-loving general manager Jason Licht was not overly enthusiastic about Dean when speaking Tuesday at the combine housed in its beehive inside the Indiana Convention Center in downtown Indianapolis. Dean is a talented corner Todd Bowles likes but Bowles also looks for takeaways from his corners, which Dean rarely provides. Joe’s biggest issue with Dean is he cannot stay on the field. He’s about to turn 29. Chronically injured guys that age don’t all of a sudden get healthier. In the last four Bucs playoff games, Dean either was not available or couldn’t finish three due to injury. In fact, in the last two Bucs playoff games, both one-score games, Dean couldn’t stay on the field in the fourth quarter. Not good. Given the chance to outright say Dean is secure, Bucs AC/DC-loving general manager instead said Dean’s status is uncertain. (Background: The following response about Dean from Licht came immediately after Light had said the team was evaluating whether to bring back Jordan Whitehead. Roughly 24 hours later, Whitehead was an ex-Bucs player.) “Another thing we are discussing internally,” Licht said of Dean’s job security. “Love Jamel. He’s done some great things for us. Been with us a long time. He hasn’t been on the field as much as we’d like. “There are some things we have to review and the whole landscape of the position, what it’s like in the draft. There is no timetable on [Dean] either. We are in no rush to make that decision.” When Joe asked a follow-up question about adding a potential starting corner given that Dean is bound to miss games with injuries, Licht responded, “That’s one position we need to add depth, if anything, to.” So Dean’s not exactly on firm ground. Nor should he be. Look, Joe likes Dean and thinks Dean is a decent player unlike many fans. But dang, he misses games. And when the guy cannot answer the bell in the most important games of the season, playoff games, what’s the point?|2025-02-28 07:00:00|349|17|3|Jamel Dean|Uncertain future with Buccaneers as injuries persist during playoffs.|3|Mixed opinions on Dean's performance and injuries, with a focus on his lack of interceptions.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Ha-Ha-Ha"", ""post"": ""It\u2019s often said the best ability is availability."", ""post_time"": [""February"", ""28th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""7:12"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""JimBobBuc"", ""post"": ""I would guess that Licht\u2019s been shopping Dean in a trade this week.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/they-call-him-the-wizard/|“They Call Him ‘The Wizard’”|It wouldn’t shock Bucs AC/DC-loving general manager Jason Licht if, under the watchful eyes of new offensive coordinator Josh Grizzard, the offense takes another step forward. Asking for the Bucs offense to improve next season is a tall order. The Bucs, statistically, had the No. 3 offense in the NFL. However, if Grizzard sticks around a couple of years (Bucs OCs have a habit of flying the coop after one season), Licht could envision an even better offense. That’s what Licht sure seemed to imply when he talked this week about the hiring of Grizzard to take over for departed Liam Coen. “We wanted to hire somebody from Lizard Lick, North Carolina, and he fit the bill,” Licht quipped at a combine podium in the Indiana Convention Center before assembled NFL media. “Josh did a fantastic job all year. Everybody in the building saw how smart he is. “He is easy to get along with with the players [and] in front of the room, he was fantastic. They call him ‘The Wizard’ – a lot of players have mentioned that. “I’m just very excited to get to see Josh in that role [of offensive coordinator]. I know he’s excited to get going. He’s going to bring some fresh ideas, which is always good.” The fresh ideas are an interesting angle. If one believes fresh ideas lead to success, and Grizzard sticks with the core of Coen’s very successful offense, then maybe at some point the Bucs offense goes from No. 3 to No. 1. And then Joe will be typing about Licht’s comments on yet another new Bucs offensive coordinator.|2025-02-28 03:46:00|270|14|7|Josh Grizzard|Bucs offense improvement potential with new offensive coordinator.|7|Positive overall sentiment with excitement for Grizz and a wish for fresh ideas in coaching.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Hodad"", ""post"": ""Or Joe you could be writing about Grizzard taking over for Bowles in 26.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/were-the-bucs-better-in-2024-than-in-2023-jason-licht-answers/|Were The Bucs Better In 2024 Than In 2023? Jason Licht Answers.|Buccaneers Ring of Honor general manager Jason Licht has few peers in the NFL. Not counting the two NFL owners that make personnel decisions, only three GMs have been in their jobs longer than Licht, per Joe’s quick count. The Bucs’ boss has had great success after a rocky start. So Licht knows what a winner looks like, and during his candid chat this week on the Ira Kaufman Podcast (yes, Joe got a finger-wagging), Licht was adamant that the 2024 Bucs were better than the prior year’s edition. Even though the 2023 Bucs were a Todd Bowles timeout and a Hail Mary magic from pushing their divisional round playoff game at Detroit into overtime, Licht says last season’s Bucs were the better club — injuries and all. Licht agonized after the season and part of that was tied to the quality of his team. “Anytime in my career, whatever position I’m in, the end of the year sucks,” Licht said. “You have a pit in your stomach, I do at least, for a good solid month unless you win the whole thing. And even if you go to the Super Bowl and lose, it’s the same feeling that you’re just dejected and borderline depressed for a period of time. So that was no different this year. And trust me, I don’t know if we would have beaten the Eagles. We have had some success; I’m 7-1 versus [Philadelphia] since they hired me, but who’s counting? “Because I felt like we had a better team this year than [in 2023], but we didn’t make it as far as we did last year.” Joe could argue the Bucs were a better team at the end of the 2023 season, but Joe thinks there’s no clear answer. Joe followed up with Licht and he held firm on his nod to the 2024 team. “I felt that way. I felt like the offense was humming. I felt like we had a better offense,” Licht said. “We did have some injuries but we were overcoming them a little bit. “I tell Todd [Bowles] all the time, when there’s a lot of injuries and there’s a lot of what-are-we-going-to-do uncertainty because of a rash of injuries, especially like at one or two positions, he always seems to come up with a really good plan. And I felt like we could have had a chance to do some damage.” Ahhh, what could have been. Joe suffers for weeks after the end of a season, too, barring a Super Bowl.|2025-02-28 00:17:00|423|12|8|Jason Licht|Jason Licht believes 2024 Bucs better than 2023 despite setbacks.|6|Mixed sentiments with some optimism and disappointment expressed by the commenters.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Buccaneer Bonzai"", ""post"": ""Kind of have to wonder what a fuller healthy Bucs team could have done."", ""post_time"": [""February"", ""28th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""1:47"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Steven #55"", ""post"": ""Offense was better Defence was worse Special Teams a Mess"", ""post_time"": [""February"", ""28th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""3:07"", ""am""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""Defense Rules"", ""post"": ""Jason Licht \u2026 \u2018I felt like the offense was humming.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/368883/|Jon Gruden Will Be Reinstated Into Bucs’ Ring Of Honor|A great wrong has been righted. Last night, it was officially announced that Team Glazer decided to reinstate the winningest coach in Bucs history, Chucky, the man who got the Bucs their first Super Bowl win, back into the coveted team’s Ring of Honor. Well done, Team Glazer. Well done! Chucky was in the Ring of Honor but his name was unceremoniously removed after personal, vile if not grossly insensitive emails from Chucky were leaked. Some allegedly were directed toward Team Glazer. The emails were typed many years ago when Chucky was an ESPN analyst on “Monday Night Football” and not coaching. Joe really had a problem with the decision to remove Chucky’s name from the Ring of Honor. Were his emails despicable? Absolutely! But Joe is very much against attempts at whitewashing history. And in Joe’s mind, removing Chucky’s name from the Ring of Honor was an attempt to rewrite Bucs history. Like it was an attempt to pretend Chucky never worked for the Bucs, as if his coaching didn’t finally push the Bucs over the hump to win the team’s first Super Bowl. Joe is a history nut and treasures history. Joe believes all history, no matter how distasteful, needs to be remembered. Rather than lazily try to cancel Chucky, Joe thought then and thinks now that those awful emails should be used as a teaching and learning tool. Canceling Chucky did nothing more than try to sweep an issue under a rug. How can we ever advance as a sophisticated society if we don’t learn from mistakes? Former St. Louis Cardinals play-by-play man Jack Buck once said when Mark McGwire broke Roger Maris’ then-season record of 60 home runs in 1998, “Pardon me for a moment while I stand to applaud.” So pardon Joe for a moment as he applauds Team Glazer for doing the right thing and reinstating Chucky into the Bucs’ hallowed Ring of Honor.|2025-02-28 00:00:00|320|0|9|Jon Gruden|Gruden reinstated into Bucs' Ring of Honor after controversial removal.||No comments available.|{}
