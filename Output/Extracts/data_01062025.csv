https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/gambling-todd-bowles/|Gambling Todd Bowles|Now this is not the Todd Bowles that Joe had grown accustomed to. Almost overnight, the Bucs head coach has gone from fishing through a tiny, rubber, palm-sized change pouch to pay for a Taco Bell beef taco to throwing $100 bills at the craps table in Aria with loose women circling in the background. If Bowles has loud critics — and he does — one of their gripes is that he’s too conservative. Punts inside enemy territory. Content kicking long field goals rather than converting fourth-and-short. Well, that image of Bowles got destroyed yesterday. The most obvious was him giving the green light to offensive coordinator Liam Coen and quarterback Baker Mayfield to throw on the final play of a one-score game, risking a playoff berth, so Mike Evans could keep his 1,000-yard receiving streak alive (and pocket $3 million in Team Glazer bonus loot). The not-as-obvious play was with the Bucs trailing 19-13 early in the fourth quarter, a fourth-and-eight from the slimy Saints-42. Mayfield hit Jalen McMillan for a 33-yard gain. (McMillan was penalized on the play but he made up for it two plays later when he had a fabulous catch of a bullet from Mayfield to give the Bucs what turned into the winning score.) When did this high-stakes roller show up on the Bucs’ sideline? And yes, Bowles said going for it on fourth-and-eight was his call. Bowles joked that Coen and Mayfield would want to try a fourth-and-30 if it was up to them. But yes, Bowles confessed, he was the aggressor on this decision. “Oh, I made it,” Bowles said. He explained his thinking. “Well, we figured if we punt it, we weren’t gaining [anything] but about 20 yards,” Bowles said. “It was fourth-and-8 and we were trying to win the division, trying to win the game. “You don’t want to look back and have regrets. We called timeouts, and we got a good play in. They did a heck of a job and Jalen [McMillan] made a heck of a catch. Baker [Mayfield] made a heck of a throw.” So is this the new Bowles that fans can expect? Joe isn’t going there. But if Bowles sticks to his explanation that he was trying to win the game, trying to jolt the offense into gear, then maybe Bucs fans will see a different Bowles beginning Sunday night against the Commandos. Then, just like yesterday, it’s win-or-Cancun.|2025-01-06 15:34:00|405|55|7|Todd Bowles|Bowles becomes aggressive; makes high-stakes coaching decisions for Bucs.|6|Mixed opinions on Bowles, with some appreciating his efforts and others criticizing his decisions.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""stpetebucsfan"", ""post"": ""(smile)  Love this piece.

The woeful New York franchise formally requested an interview with the right hand man of Buccaneers general manager Jason Licht. Assistant Bucs GM Mike Greenberg, “Greeny,” was a Bucs hire before Licht arrived and was billed as a salary cap guru after a year spent in scouting. The Jets want to interview Greenberg for their vacant GM gig. Greenberg has had vocal support on New York sports radio from Giants legend Tiki Barber, Rondé’s brother. Joe’s happy Greenberg got recognized, but Joe is uneasy about what a potential Greenberg hire in New York could represent as it relates to the immediate future of Bucs offensive coordinator Liam Coen.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/winning-without-antoine-winfield-jr/|Winning Without Antoine Winfield, Jr.|Imagine if Buccaneers Ring of Honor general manager Jason Licht didn’t re-sign safety Antoine Winfield in March, when Licht made Winfield the highest paid defensive back in NFL history.  There would have been a ton of outrage, as well as some applause. A faction of Bucs fans believe no safety is worth a massive investment. Fast-forward to the 2024 season and Winfield hurt is foot in Week 1. Then he missed several games, didn’t seem the same when he played and subsequently hurt his knee. In total, the Bucs’ ultimate playmaker of 2023 skipped eight games and finished the regular season without a making many plays. Heck, he wasn’t even on the field for the Bucs’ shining upsets of the Lions and Chargers. This would have been unthinkable a year ago. So Joe thinks it’s fair to say the Bucs won 10 games this season without Winfield — at least the Winfield fans were used to. Overall, the Bucs were 5-3 without him. A Todd Bowles loyalist could argue the head coach lost his best player on defense and offense (Chris Godwin) and still brought home 10 wins and a division crown by a two-game margin. Impressive. Regardless, the Bucs winning without Winfield has Joe extra excited for what lies ahead next season for the Tampa Bay defense.|2025-01-06 15:07:00|218|47|5|Buccaneers|Bucs win without injured star player; optimistic outlook for future.|3|Mixed opinions on Winfield's performance, questioning value, injury impact, and potential future contributions.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""A Bucs Fan"", ""post"": ""Winfield\u2019s coverage was awful this year.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/i-dont-know-why-that-is/|“I Don’t Know Why That Is”|You got answers? It sounds like the Buccaneers’ defensive coordinator will be happy to hear them. No, this isn’t a Bill Sheridan moment, but Todd Bowles, the Bucs head coach/D-coordinator admitted to being a little flummoxed by his defensive players today. Speaking at One Buc Palace, Bowles was asked by his defense ranks 30th in points allowed in the first halves of games but No. 2 in second halves. What kind of adjustments is Bowles making? Very few, if any, he said. “It’s not a whole lot of adjustments. I mean, there are things we talk about. We just play more aggressive in the second half once [players] see things,” Bowles said. “I don’t know why that is. We keep trying to start out that way. And we talk about it; we know that’s happening. We know what’s gonna happen. Lotta different parts with the different guys playing, but we just got to play that way for four quarters and they’re capable of it.” So players aren’t playing aggressively enough until they see the opposing offense with their own eyes. That’s sort of what Bowles is saying. Even though players aren’t getting surprised, they’re tentative early. Whatever. It must be fixed. Joe wonders if Team Glazer needs to bring in a S.W.A.T. team of sports psychologists or perhaps Lavonte David can organize a bounty for first-half pass breakups. What makes this enigma even more baffling is the Bucs defense comes out ugly against familiar division opponents, too.|2025-01-06 13:45:00|247|41|5|Todd Bowles|Defensive struggles and adjustments for Buccaneers' coach.|3|Frustration and disappointment with the team's performance and defensive strategies.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Cchead"", ""post"": ""Don\u2019t think Bowles is telling the whole truth.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/todd-bowles-offers-brief-updates-on-injured-bucs/|Todd Bowles Offers Brief Updates On Injured Bucs|UPDATED*: The Bucs have a few starters, key injured starters, that they have not written off for the season. Yet. When Bucs coach Todd Bowles uses the term, “not at this time” while referencing injuries, that means that player showing up in the next game is probably off the table. That appears to be the case for a key reserve linebacker and a Pro Bowl receiver. Bowles was asked about SirVocea Dennis. The linebacker, who when he did play made an impact, blew up his shoulder against the Eagles in late September and hasn’t played since. Bowles said Dennis is not available “at this time.” Joe spoke with Dennis last week and he told Joe returning at some point in the playoffs was very much on the table. He didn’t have a timeline. Then Bowles was asked if it was “impossible” for Chris Godwin to return. When he blew out his ankle against the Crows, there was feint hope Godwin might available in the postseason. Bowles said of Godwin, “Not at this time.” So Dennis and Godwin haven’t been ruled out but it sure sounds like a no-go for the playoff opener against Washington. Joe has said on the Ira Kaufman Podcast that Godwin is done for the entirety of the season. *Bowles also said safety Jordan Whitehead (car accident) is not in play for Sunday. He seemed to leave Sunday’s door open a crack for Jamel Dean, Cade Otton and Antoine Winfield saying, “We’ll see” how they practice later in the week.|2025-01-06 13:28:00|253|25|4|Todd Bowles|Updates on injured Bucs starters for playoffs.|4|Mixed sentiments with some optimism but overall more negative and critical comments.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""SteveK"", ""post"": ""Would be great to get Winfield back.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/todd-bowles-shows-off-his-comedic-timing/|Todd Bowles Shows Off His Comedic Timing|Joe only wishes Bucs fans could see the side of Todd Bowles Joe often sees. Bowles, as most fans know, is a stoic figure on the sidelines. You see him talk on his headset and that’s about it. He’s not quite the sphinx Tom Landry was, but Bowles is close. This, of course, gives off the vibe that Bowles is bored or hates his job or would rather be digging splinters out of his hands than coaching. At a podium, 98 percent of the time, Bowles tries to do his best Bill Belichick impersonation, only he doesn’t mumble. Joe typed “98 percent” because Bowles once in a while will let out his true self. Away from the prying eye of the camera, Bowles is borderline gregarious. Always quick with a laugh, almost always smiling. Always willing to strike up a conversation. It’s almost like Bowles believes he has to act a certain way or put up a front in public. This introverted personality curtain drives a lot of fans nuts. “Why isn’t he as intense as I am and I’m not getting paid millions?” Joe gets it. What fans (mostly) see out from Bowles isn’t the real Bowles. Really. So today, Bowles’ true self seeped out at his day-after presser. Bowles was asked about, in a one-score game with the playoffs on the line (at the time, the Stinking Panthers-Dixie Chicks were in overtime), giving Bucs offensive coordinator Liam Coen and quarterback Baker Mayfield the green light to try to get Mike Evans’ to 1,000 yards receiving. Evans’ streak of 1,000-yard receiving seasons was on the line. Oh, and Evans was also due a $3 million bonus if he hit 1,000 receiving yards. Joe honestly expected Bowles to order the victory formation. For a conservative, defensive guy, this move to throw with seconds left in a one-score game with so much on the line had to be an out-of-body experience. “I was just hoping [the pass] was complete,” Bowles said of his decision. And then Bowles had the one-liner of the day. “I think Mike owes me a million dollars.” And with that, Bowles tapped the podium and immediately exited stage left.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/jalen-mcmillan-says-his-surge-came-from-learning-to-be-a-pro/|Jalen McMillan Says His Surge Came From Learning To Be A Pro|Joe likes to say rookies play like rookies because they are rookies. It is part of the learning process of entering the NFL. Rookies often have to learn they are no longer playing the East Cornfield State squads of the world. And from whom did Bucs rookie receiver Jalen McMillan begin learning how to be a pro? Teammates and his coaches. McMillan’s touchdown grab yesterday, a sweet toe-tapping catch along the right sideline after adjusting when seeing Baker Mayfield was flushed, gave him seven touchdown catches in his last five games. The last time a rookie had more consecutive games with touchdown catches was Randy Moss in 1998 — seven games. Impressive stuff. Even more impressive is McMillan, after catching a touchdown pass in his first NFL game, the season opener against the Commandos, went seven games without a TD. It was like McMillan, who excelled in training camp and underwear football, went into the witness protection program. Even worse, his slump came when the Bucs needed him most: when Mike Evans and Chris Godwin went down with injuries. So what turned McMillan around? Joe spoke with the Washington product after Sunday’s win. A confident man, McMillan said he had strong support from his teammates, his position coach Bryan McClendon and Bucs offensive coordinator Liam Coen. No one gave up on him, McMillan said. Rather, his teammates and coaches kept pushing him. And the key, McMillan learned, was consistency. If you work consistently, daily, it will pay off. McMillan said his recent success is a direct reflection of how he learned what it takes to enjoy success on the NFL level. “It was all with the help of “B-Mac” [McClendon] and Coach Liam [Coen] and everybody around this building,” McMillan said. “They all believed in me. Spoke strength to me. They spoke consistency to me. “Every day doing the same thing. I kind of did that in college but now, I’m doing it every single day. Just the same thing. “You know, it gets boring. It gets boring. And I’m slowly realizing that is what it takes to be successful. Waking up and literally doing the same thing every single day.” McMillan then told Joe that the support and push to raise his game from his teammates and coaches was a big factor. “This is a testament to everybody [his faith and the team] and a testament to myself,” McMillan said of how he’s blown up lately. “It is a testament to my mentality and my work [habits].” McMillan isn’t lacking self-confidence. But he also knows that if not for his teammates’ and coaches’ support and drive for him to be his best, he may still be the struggling receiver who was invisible for seven weeks. This goes back to what Joe has heard Mayfield refer to several times. When he came to the Bucs he was struck by how professional everyone in the building was, and that they knew what it took to win and went about their business accordingly. That sort of sounds like what McMillan was describing to Joe yesterday. This is how you work in order to succeed and win.|2025-01-06 11:34:00|524|36|8|Jalen McMillan|Rookie receiver learns pro mentality; excels with teammates' support.|5|Mixed sentiments with some optimism and some practical observations.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Bucsfan"", ""post"": ""Players also learn that from observing the example set by the HC Todd Bowles-all should realize that."", ""post_time"": [""Bucsfan""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""unbelievable"", ""post"": "" When he came to the Bucs last year he was struck by how professional everyone in the building was and that they knew what it took to win and went about their business, accordingly."", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""6th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""11:51"", ""am""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""Lt.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/bucky-irving-is-nfls-10th-leading-rusher-sets-bucs-record/|Bucky Irving Is NFL’s 10th Leading Rusher; Sets Bucs Record|Did Bucky Irving have a bad game this season? Maybe not. Yeah, one could argue Irving’s fourth-quarter fumble in Atlanta cost the Bucs a “W.” Irving is forgiven. The rookie superstar finished the regular season with 207 carries for 1,122 yards and 8 rushing touchdowns. And he was prolific as a receiver (47 catches for 392 yards). That rushing total was 10th-best in the NFL this season. More important, Irving’s 5.4 yards per carry ranked tied for fourth in the NFL among full-time running backs. That 5.4 yards-per-carry mark also set a Buccaneers running backs record. The previous best for a single Bucs season was held by Ronald Jones, when he averaged 5.1 yards per carry in 192 attempts as the Bucs’ bellcow back in 2020. In 2005, Michael Pittman had 70 carries for a whopping 436 yards (6.2 yards per carry) as a complement to Cadillac Williams. But that was just five carries per game, so he wasn’t a full-time ball carrier like Irving or Jones. What makes all things Irving even more exciting is he’ll return next season with experience and most likely his entire offensive line, assuming the Bucs can re-sign Ben Bredeson in free agency.|2025-01-06 09:35:00|199|43|7|Bucky Irving|Rookie RB breaks records|7|Mixed sentiment with moderate optimism and some concerns about specific players and coaching decisions.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""DoooshLaRue"", ""post"": ""Who doesn\u2019t love Bucky?"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""6th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""9:37"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""DoooshLaRue"", ""post"": ""Oh wait\u2026."", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""6th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""9:37"", ""am""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""SB"", ""post"": ""Imagine if he played from the beginning of the yr."", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""6th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""9:47"", ""am""]}, ""commenter3"": {""username"": ""loweredexpectations"", ""post"": ""I\u2019ve been a fan since \u201994 and the statement I\u2019ll make goes doubly true for you old timers since \u201976\u2026 \u201cI CAN NOT BELIEVE THE BUCS OFFENSE IS NOT THE PROBLEM!\u201d"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""6th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""10:03"", ""am""]}, ""commenter4"": {""username"": ""ModHairKen"", ""post"": ""You know, two or three games were lost by fumbles or mishaps at the end.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/the-bucs-have-hope/|The Bucs Have Hope|Joe generally finds the word “hope” to be vile. Joe always liked Bobby Knight’s reaction to the word hope. He thought it was the worst four-letter word in the King’s English. But on this fine Victory Monday morning, Joe will play along. Even though the Bucs nearly tripped over themselves yesterday, they found a way to win, which is what good teams do. And Jenna Laine of ESPN believes the resiliency of the Bucs could allow them to make a run in this winter’s playoffs. Reason for hope: A versatile, high-powered offense. The Bucs are averaging 28.6 offensive points — fourth most in the league and third most in franchise history, trailing only the Tom Brady-led Super Bowl team in 2020 and another Brady-led team in 2021. Quarterback Baker Mayfield has 41 touchdown passes, tied for second in the NFL. Mayfield also has the third-highest completion percentage (71.4%) and third-most passing yards (4,500). And Tampa Bay is averaging 149.2 rushing yards, the fourth most in the league. The defense will be the critical puzzle for the Bucs. Which defense shows up? And why does a player (or players) have to say things that need to be said at halftime for the defense to wake up and fly straight? Why can’t they have their heads right to begin the game? It will help a lot if Antoine Winfield can return Sunday. Joe saw Jamel Dean in the locker room last week. He wasn’t wearing any sort of brace that Joe could tell and he also wasn’t using crutches. So Joe guesses that’s a good sign. Sooner or later in the playoffs, playing backups in the secondary will catch up with a team.|2025-01-06 09:00:00|281|52|'8|The Bucs|Bucs' potential for strong playoff run.'|3|Mixed opinions on Bucs defense, hoping for improvements but concerns exist.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""TheBucsAnthem"", ""post"": ""Nobody worries about the Bucs offense\u2026\u2026.it\u2019s the Bucs defense that brings \u201cno hope\u201d to winning games."", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""6th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""9:03"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""AMI_Chris"", ""post"": ""I love my Bucs but they are really just a somewhat-above-average team.

And Zyon McCollum may have had the best game of his first year starting. McCollum damn near had two picks, one of which would have been a pick-six, several strong tackles and four passes defended yesterday. You read that right: McCollum had four passes defended. For a defense that too often sleepwalked through yesterday’s first half, McCollum came to play. Perhaps his strong play helped keep the slimy Saints out of the end zone a time or two.

It’s in the Bucs’ best interest to retain their first-year NFL playcaller for another season. It may not be ideal for Team Glazer’s balance sheet, but that’s not Joe’s concern. Team Glazer likes to say it operates in the best interest of the franchise, so Joe’s clinging to that on this fine Monday. Make it happen! So why is Coen so critical? Joe will point to the 30-point club. If you have an offense that can score 30 points per game, then you will be in the playoffs. Don’t buy it? How bout 15 years worth of data. Below are all the teams that have scored 29.9 points or more in a season since the 2010 campaign. Every freakin’ one made the playoffs. (Joe included this year’s Bucs for perspective.) Points per game: 2024 Lions 33.2, Bills 30.9, Ravens 30.5 (Bucs 29.5) 2023 Cowboys 30.1 2022* None (Chiefs led league at 29.2) 2021 Cowboys 30.4, Bucs 29.9 2020 Packers 31.5, Bucs 30.8, Bills 29.9 2019 Ravens 33.2, 49ers 29.9 2018 Chiefs 35.3, Rams 32.9, Saints 31.5 2017 Rams 29.9 2016 Falcons 33.8 2015 Panthers 31.3, Cardinals 30.6 2014 Packers 30.4, Broncos 30.1 2013 Broncos 37.9 2012 Patriots 34.8, Broncos 30.1 2011 Packers 35.0, Saints, 34.2, Patriots, 32.1 2010 Patriots 32.4 Again, all 27 teams made the playoffs. So did this year’s Bucs at 29.5 points per game. Scoring rules the NFL, shaky defense or not. Coen proved he can put points on the board — even with stars off the field. Team Glazer might need a full research team to find a first-year offensive coordinator that was as successful as Coen was this year. Make it happen, Glazer.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/five-things-85/|Five Things|What a wonderful Victory Monday this is! 2024 NFC South champs. Mike Evans kept his streak alive. A Sunday night playoff game. Good times. Fun times. Let’s get rolling. So grab your mug of coffee, piping hot! None of this iced stuff. Act like a man! Quite A Turnaround “This Joe” has to admit to thinking two months ago that the playoffs just weren’t in the cards. The Bucs had lost four straight, three of those four to playoff teams and a fourth to a team that appeared to be the new big dogs of the NFC South, the Dixie Chicks. The Bucs were beaten up, badly. The physical Crows put Mike Evans on ice for three games and put Chris Godwin out for the year. It appeared really grim. But with a crafty offensive coordinator who found ways to make chicken salad out of chicken s(p)it, the grit of Baker Mayfield and the steady guidance of Bucs coach Todd Bowles, the Bucs came back from the bye on a mission, winning six of the final seven games. Very impressive. As a result, the Bucs are one of the hottest teams in the league. Sure, they stubbed their toes at Dallas and nearly shat the bed yesterday at The Licht House. But each week the Bucs found ways to win, more often than not. Bucky Irving here, Jalen McMillan there, Cade Otton over here, Anthony Nelson there, Calijah Kancey over here. Each week someone stepped up. Devin Culp, too. And the Bucs kept winning. At the end, you look up, shake your head back and forth like Yosemite Sam, and realize, “Wait a minute. The Bucs won another division.” Could the Bucs win a playoff game or two? Why not? After the Bucs lost to the 49ers, who exactly expected the Bucs to be where they are today? The Mike Evans Streak Way cool that despite missing three games, Evans was still able to pull in 1,000 yards receiving. So Joe doesn’t want to hear anyone whining about Evans playing 17 games — no he did not! Joe thought Evans said something very interesting after the game. In the first half, Evans got loose down the right sideline and was wide @ss open. He catches that pass, he blows through 1,000 yards. But Mayfield overshot him. The fans at The Licht House were sick. You could hear the moans and feel the anguish. But Evans told reporters he would never get after Mayfield for missing him. Evans added, in so many words, Mayfield’s human too. “It happens – it’s football,” Evans said. “I drop passes, we miss blocks – things happen. I could never be mad at Baker. “He has been our rock this whole year. Even when I was out, he was still making plays. He’s an unbelievable player – I’ll never be mad at ‘Bake’ for just missing a throw. It comes with the game.” Now that’s a class act and that’s why Joe thinks Evans is such a fan favorite. Humble. Virtually no ego. Little to no diva. Players Were Locked In — On Mike Evans’ Streak Joe heard (and read) the following question quite a bit yesterday, especially through the first three quarters. “How could a team with so much on the line come out with so little energy and play so sloppily?” Joe is beginning to think the Bucs were too focused on the wrong prize. Every Bucs player Joe spoke with — several — after yesterday’s game pretty much said the same thing: Getting Evans past the 1,000-yards receiving plateau was a big thing throughout the game. Joe had defensive players tell him there was constant chatter on the sidelines, “How many more yards does Mike need?” Bucs corner Zyon McCollum told Joe on the slimy Saints’ last possession, he was yelling at fellow defensive backs to get the ball back so Evans could keep his streak alive. Of course, this was hovering over the offense all afternoon. Maybe the Bucs were thinking about Evans’ streak a little too much? Don’t get Joe wrong: Joe’s happy as can be Evans is now going for an NFL record 12 straight seasons of 1,000 yards receiving. But with so much focus on Evans by his teammates, did they sort of forget or maybe lose sight of the fact they were playing for a division title? As it turned out, the Dixie Chicks did their part and lost. That Carolina-Atlanta game went into overtime while the Bucs were still battling. At halftime, Bucs linebacker K.J. Britt told Joe “reality hit” and players began to get their minds straight. Still, from what Joe was told, the Evans chatter on the team was constant. So maybe the Bucs came out so sluggish yesterday and playing like they were in slow motion is because not enough of their concentration was focused on the win. Hey, it all worked out though, right? Time For Todd Bowles Props It’s high time for fans to come to grips with reality. The Bucs have a good coach in Todd Bowles. If anything, he’s closer to getting a contract extension than he is getting run. Bowles became the first head coach in Bucs history to lead his team to three division titles in his first three years. John McKay didn’t do that (obviously). Father Dungy never did that. Chucky failed to pull that off. Not even Bucco Bruce Arians climbed that mountain. But Bowles? Yeah, he did. Why did Joe bring up those four coaches? Because all four* are in the Buccaneers Ring of Honor (*-Chucky’s name was ripped off the Ring of Honor but the process of possibly putting Chucky’s name back in its rightful place is underway). What has Bowles not done that those other four have? McKay, Father Dungy, Chucky and Bucco Bruce all got the Bucs to an NFC Championship game. To get there this year, the Bucs will have to win two playoff games. Joe gets that some fans don’t like Bowles and maybe never will. There are various reasons: Cooper Kupp, stoic sideline demeanor, nasty habit of losing close games, uneven play from his defense, play-it-safe strategy, etc. Some of those elements will never change. Bowles isn’t going to go out there and act like Chucky on the sidelines to please anyone. That seems to be a huge gripe some fans have. But dang, the Bucs have gotten better every year Bowles has been the head coach. His teams never quit, even though they have a habit of painting themselves into a corner midway through a season. And the past two years, the Bucs entered the playoffs on a hot streak. So, yeah, Joe thinks folks ought to be giving Bowles some credit, not scorn. If the Bucs, for whatever reason, had to replace Bowles later this month and you knew a candidate to fill the vacancy would win division titles in the next three seasons, you’d hire the guy on the spot. Well, the Bucs already have that coach. His name is “Todd Bowles.” Playoffs, Baby! This will be a fun week. All of us hoped but none of us knew the Bucs would be prepping for a playoff game on this wonderful Victory Monday. Sunday Night Football. Under the lights. Prime time. Not bad. Not nearly as much buzz as Monday Night Football but it’s better than an afternoon game. Instead of Joe Buck and Troy Aikman, the Commandos and Bucs will get Mike Tirico and Cris Collinsworth. Instead of “Stay in Bed” and “Last Take” — hell, both shows may have set up shop at The Licht House, pimping the Bucs game for hours next Monday morning — the Bucs will get a lot of run from Mike Florio at the NBC studios in Rockefeller Plaza. The Bucs made it. They got to the playoffs! They won the NFC South for the fourth straight year — fourpeat! Anything can happen now. This will be a fun week. Joe’s going to love it.  |2025-01-06 05:00:00|1336|82|8|Five Things|Buccaneers win NFC South title|4|Mixed sentiments towards Bowles with fans split on his coaching abilities and team performance.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Joe in Michigan"", ""post"": ""I\u2019ll give Bowles props for coaching better in the second half of most of the games since the bye week, the problem with that being the Bucs defense will have to play a complete game to beat a good team.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/bucs-2025-opponents-set/|Bucs 2025 Opponents Set|So the 2024 regular season closed yesterday. Man, time flies. Now opponents for the following season are set. The Bucs, of course, play their division rivals home and away. So three home games and three road games with Atlanta, Carolina and New Orleans. The Bucs next year, per Scott Smith of Buccaneers.com, play the entire NFC West: two on the road and two at home. So road games at Los Angeles and at Seattle are on tap. Arizona and San Francisco will come to Tampa. The Bucs will also play the AFC East. Road games in Buffalo and Miami and home games against New England and the Jets are on their way. Additionally, the Bucs have road games at Detroit and at Houston, and a home game against Philadelphia. The Bucs will play nine road games in 2025 as NFC/AFC teams take turns with nine home games each year. On even-numbered years the NFC gets nine home games; in odd-numbered years the NFC has nine road games.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/baker-mayfield-finishes-season-with-rare-numbers/|Baker Mayfield Finishes Season With Rare Numbers|Yeah, it seems that the signing of Baker Mayfield back in the spring of 2023 was a pretty slick move. We all know the story. Mayfield was at a crossroads in his career. Two loser franchises dumped him in the wake of him nearly pulling off an upset of the Chiefs on the road in the playoffs in 2020. Lying on the landfill of NFL quarterback busts, the former No. 1 overall pick was snatched up by the Rams in an emergency situation, played some good ball and was looking for a team that would allow him to bet on himself. With the steady pushing of Bucs coach Todd Bowles, Bucs AC/DC-loving general manager Jason Licht took a flier on Mayfield and had him to compete (allegedly) to succeed Tom Brady. Mayfield had a career year last year and a career year this season. In fact, Mayfield had such a strong performance in his second year with the Bucs, very few humans have had better as an NFL signal-caller. Per NFL Research by way of Nick Shook of NFL.com, Mayfield finished the 2024 regular season with a 70-plus percent completion percentage, threw for 4,500 passing yards and also had 40 touchdown passes. Only two quarterbacks had equaled that before Mayfield became the third in league history. So yeah, Joe thinks that $4 million flier the Bucs took on Mayfield sure did pay off.|2025-01-06 00:00:00|233|71|5|Baker Mayfield|Mayfield excels with rare stats|5|Mixed sentiments about Baker Mayfield, some optimistic, others critical.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""William Walls"", ""post"": ""Gee, you\u2019d think a guy with numbers like that could sniff a Pro Bowl\u2026"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""6th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""12:01"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""firethecannons"", ""post"": ""I could care less about pro-bowl\u2013thats a joke!
