Bob Papa has been the Giants’ radio play-by-play guy for 30 years and has worked for the team in other capacities. He’s also heard hosting weekly on SiriusXM NFL Radio.Picking winners and losers for Week 12 today, Papa said he tried to find it in himself to pick the Giants but he can’t.Two big reasons were on Papa’s mind.First, the Giants run defense is horrid, as Papa described it. He noted that the Giants have allowed 894 rushing yards in the past five games: “And until they show that they can stop [the run], I can’t believe it.”Papa added that even if Giants replacement QB Tommy DeVito gives the team a spark, he doesn’t think it will overcome the many deficiencies of the Giants defense.Papa also thinks Baker Mayfield will be a scrambling threat and pick apart the Giants’ weak secondary just enough. “At the end of the day, it’s the Baker Mayfield show,” he said.Joe agrees that it is time for Mayfield to put the Bucs on his back. He’s certainly played well, but this is a game he cannot allow his team to lose.The Bucs’ run game should dominate — the Giants allow a league-worst 5.3 yards per carry — but Mayfield will have opportunities that a true franchise QB needs to make to bury a poor team.", "post_time": "2024-11-22T21:15:47+00:00", "word_count": 247, "number_of_comments": 19, "article_sentiment_score": "7", "article_subject": "Baker Mayfield", "article_summary": "Giants have doubts", "responses": {"commenter0": {"username": "Stillabucsfan", "post": "Gotta catch back up with burrow at 27 td’s, Baker is about to go tf off with M1KE coming back", "post_time": "November 22nd, 2024 at 4:34 pm"}, "commenter1": {"username": "Rover", "post": "Anyone here remember the 2019 Daniel Jones first start/game after the Eli Manning benching??

The Bucs also are bad at 4-6, but they’re not falling apart and they’ve played a brutal schedule.So NFL pundits, not including other than those lining the streets of Cliffside Park and Jersey City, are unified in their belief that the Bucs will beat the Giants on Sunday.Former Bucs quarterback Chris Simms sees a 27-20 victory for the Bucs. First, Simms isn’t caught up in the hype surrounding Giants No. 3 QB Tommy DeVito getting the start.“To think that he can just jump in here and play really high level football, I gotta see that to believe it,” Simms said on Pro Football Talk. “Now we know this is a Bucs defense that’s not real good. So there might be some plays there to be had.”Simms sounded like he wanted to pick the Bucs in a blowout but couldn’t justify it.“Is there anybody there with the Bucs at wide receiver that can expose [the Giants’ secondary] right now? That’s what I worry about a little bit, as far as dictating [by] how much they win the football game,” Simms said.Former Todd Bowles coaching colleague and Chiefs head coach Todd Haley said on SiriusXM NFL Radio that he likes the Bucs on Sunday for the “desperation” factor.It’s all-or-nothing for the Bucs at this point, he noted, whereas the Giants are in a very different place.Joe and fellow longtime Bucs fans have seen this dance before, a game in which a Bucs team has a lot more on the line — and more talent — than their opponent.

Be a professional. Find a way.Get open for Baker Mayfield.“When the ball needs to come out … we need them open [for the] timing and rhythm of the play,” Coen said. “Those are some of the things that did kind of occur in that San Francisco game. When we needed the ball out, maybe we couldn’t truly get it out at times.”Still, Coen added he should have done a better job scheming guys open and finding ways to test the San Francisco defense.“That’s also on us, too, and helping put them in a position to get open and move them around a little bit,” Coen said.Joe guesses whatever the 49ers did defensively, the Giants will to try to duplicate it on Sunday, as will other teams.While the Giants aren’t the 49ers, the Giants have a better pass rush.

The guy with the hot hand would log the majority of snaps after that.When the Bucs played the 49ers, fans saw that theories and plans are not reality. Or, as Mike Tyson once said, “Everybody has a plan until you get punched in the mouth.”Yesterday, Bucs offensive coordinator Liam Coen confessed it’s hard to find snaps for Tucker, which is why he’s been pretty much buried on the bench.“It’s so hard to be able to say, ‘Ok, this guy on this play,’” Coen said. “Now we’re subbing in and out every play. We haven’t been able to play with any tempo because we’re changing personnel almost every play because we’re trying to put holes in there.“‘Ok, we have to fix this one, we have to move this guy.’ The goal going into this year was to play an ‘11’ personnel and be ready to go. Now we’ve had to kind of go this way and that way to go to ‘12’ and ‘21’, and different variations which is great.“It gets other people involved but it also does make it harder on us to move those pieces around every play and that gets to be, at times, exhausting.”Well, this is not the first time Coen has mentioned a lot of subbing sort of screws up the flow of the offense, the tempo.Joe believes constantly flipping guys in and out just so they can get snaps messes with the offense.So why did the Bucs push the notion (and false hope?) that Tucker would get a chance each game to stay on the field and earn more carries?Could it be that since the Bucs couldn’t more losses the team scrapped plans to, in essence, hold a live running back tryout each game?", "post_time": "2024-11-22T05:00:47+00:00", "word_count": 341, "number_of_comments": 17, "article_sentiment_score": "4", "article_subject": "Sean Tucker", "article_summary": "Bucs struggling to find playing time for Tucker.", "responses": {"commenter0": {"username": "Lou.", "post": "Sean is a major asset.
