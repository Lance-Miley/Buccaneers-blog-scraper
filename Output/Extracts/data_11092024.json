Lovie got fired after that season following his defense allowing a 77 percent completion rate over the last four games of the season.Fast forward to modern times, and Todd Bowles’ defense has allowed a 77 percent completion rate over the past three games. (Joe rounded down from 77.89 percent.)And here comes Brock Purdy and the 49ers into The Licht House tomorrow for a critical NFC showdown. Purdy is known for his accuracy but has been struggling in that area this season (64.5 percent).Overall, the Bucs rank 26th in the NFL when it comes to opponents’ complete rate — 68.5 percent. Miracle-working Atlanta is worst in the league at 70.85 percent.If the Bucs are to win tomorrow, they’re going to have to fix the pass defense in a hurry and not allow Purdy to carve them up like he did in 2022 and 2023.Is shouldn’t be too much to ask to disrupt the guy enough so he can’t hit on two-thirds of his throws.Ira Kaufman Talks 49ers-Bucs, Bill Belichick Rumblings, Long-Range Optimism, Cornerback Situation, And More", "post_time": "2024-11-09T23:58:33+00:00", "word_count": 209, "number_of_comments": 19, "article_sentiment_score": "5", "article_subject": "Bucs defense", "article_summary": "Focus on improving pass defense to win critical NFC showdown.", "responses": {"commenter0": {"username": "Bobby M.", "post": "Bowles entire scheme is super dependent on an offense putting up points consistently…..you get up two scores and he can unleash a constant borage of blitzes.

Joe is not saying White is, but it’s certainly worth exploring.Defensive line coach/run game coordinator Kacy Rodgers was on the Buccaneers Radio Network this week and talked about how the Bucs defense loves loading up the box and stuffing the run. However, that strategy has been scrapped this year due to lost talent in the secondary.“Right now we’ve got some youth in our secondary, so we had to take that defender away,” Rodgers said.Telling stuff there from Rodgers.Safety Antoine Winfield Jr. missed four games after a Week 1 injury. Starting cornerback Jamel Dean is on injured reserve with a hamstring injury and his backup, Bryce Hall, was lost for the season in Week 1.So yeah, the Bucs are hurting in the defensive backfield.

Why ruin a perfectly good Saturday?)Aaron Schatz, the founder of Football Outsiders (RIP) typed a piece for BSPN on what position each team needs to focus on once their 2024 season ends.Joe was happy (sort of) to read Schatz isn’t a fan of Bucs inside linebackers either.Inside linebacker. … … One of these years, though, 34-year-old Lavonte David is going to retire, and there’s nobody behind him. Losing David means losing a lot of big plays, as he is consistently near the top of the league in defeats (a metric adding together turnovers, tackles for loss and plays to prevent a third-down conversion). He has 17 this season.The Bucs might be really, really hurting for linebackers if Lavonte David retires. What then? Surely Todd Bowles won’t be banking on K.J. Britt and J.J. Russell as his inside linebackers next year.(And then there is this nonsense with this mysterious Vi Jones, a guy who Monday against the Chiefs had three snaps on defense, his first  in a NFL game in two years. Bowles has said he didn’t turn to Jones previously despite Britt struggling in pass coverage. Why? Because Jones wasn’t ready yet. Good grief, isn’t that what offseason, training camp and the worthless preseason is for? If he wasn’t ready, why didn’t the Bucs go get a linebacker who could defend the pass? You mean to tell Joe the Bucs are willing to see the defense implode because they’re too tight to spend a third-day draft pick to get a competent pass-defending linebacker?
