https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/keep-the-cameras-rolling-on-2024/|Keep The Cameras Rolling On 2024|BY IRA KAUFMAN Next year marks the 50th season in Buccaneer annals. To celebrate the occasion, the Glazers have commissioned a first-class documentary crew to honor the franchise’s history. The film makers have crisscrossed the country to interview players, coaches, executives and even a few journalists in an effort to flesh out critical moments since the inaugural 1976 season. It began inauspiciously with an 0-26 start that was chronicled by NFL Films, focusing on the team’s weekly gaffes on the field and John McKay’s sarcastic barbs on the sidelines. Through the decades, there have been many highs and lows. There have been Super Bowl parades that united a community, along with extended playoff droughts that tested the patience of loyal fans. After the 2010 season, when a second-year quarterback by the name of Josh Freeman led Tampa Bay to an improbable 10-6 finish, Joel Glazer termed it one of the most rewarding years for ownership since the franchise changed hands in 1995. This season is starting to have the same feel. In danger of falling into the NFL abyss at 4-6, the 2024 Bucs are now a hot topic of conversation in league circles. Analysts want to talk about ’em, fans can’t wait for the next game and opposing NFC teams don’t want to see these guys come January. “I really like their roster all the way through,” says Dallas coach Mike McCarthy, who will try to end Tampa Bay’s 4-game winning streak Sunday night. Yes, another prime-time game for one of the league’s hottest clubs. Don’t look now, but there’s a very good chance the Bucs will end the regular season with a 7-game winning streak. That would set a franchise record and give a young team considerable momentum to knock off a wild-card opponent at home in the opening playoff round. And the best part of all … this team isn’t going away. You would think Chris Godwin’s dislocated ankle will lower the cost of bringing him back in 2025. The oldest starter on a very sturdy offensive line is 26 and Baker Mayfield is in his prime. “They’ve got excellent balance,” McCarthy says. “Baker Mayfield is playing some of the best football of his career. This is a huge challenge for our defense, absolutely.” On defense, you don’t have to tell general manager Jason Licht twice that adding a dynamic edge rusher is Job 1. A unit shredded twice by Kirk Cousins has suddenly found its rhythm behind Todd Bowles, the master of disguise. “I like the way Todd’s teams play and I like the way he coaches,” McCarthy says. “I have a lot of respect for him.” McCarthy says Lavonte David, who turns 35 next month, looks like he hasn’t aged a day, adding, “He’s just a hell of a football player.” There’s no reason to think these Bucs are facing a short window to compete with the big boys. Another successful draft and a few key free-agent signings would make the Bucs a strong favorite to win the NFC South. There’s work to be done in the next three weeks but this team controls its own destiny. Unlike the Falcons, Tampa Bay doesn’t need help to make the postseason. Do you think the Lions, now decimated by a flurry of injuries on defense, want to see the Bucs in January? No way. Detroit was pretty much at full strength when the Bucs won at Ford Field in Week 2. Hopefully, the documentary crew will save plenty of film to discuss the 49th season of Buccaneer football. Next year promises to be historic. This year may not be far behind.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/cade-otton-is-a-gametime-decision-antoine-winfield-is-out/|Cade Otton Is A Gametime Decision; Antoine Winfield Is Out|One of the best tight ends in the game, Cade Otton, (yes, Cade Otton) has a bad knee and will be a gametime decision on Sunday night, per Todd Bowles’ comments after practice today. Otton has only missed one game in his career, as a rookie in 2022, so this would be a standout loss. Yes, No. 2 tight end Payne Durham has had a good blocking season, and Joe thinks he’d catch a bunch of balls if the Bucs threw his way. In very limited opportunities, Durham has shown a flair for special catches. No. 3 Ko Kieft is a capable blocker, as well, and rookie Devin Culp has barely played. Joe’s not concerned about the Bucs’ ability to beat Dallas on Sunday without Otton. But he’s certainly a necessary piece for the postseason. The only Buccaneer confirmed “out” for the game (not on injured reserve) is stud safety Antoine Winfield Jr. He’s dealing with a sprained knee and missed last Sunday’s game.|2024-12-20 14:23:00|164|24|5|Cade Otton|Otton may be out|3|Mixed sentiments with concerns over moderation and player performance.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""GoneGator"", ""post"": ""Joe\u2026. do you just not post comments by some of us, but allow dozens and dozens of comments by others, to try and make a point?"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""20th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""2:42"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Joe"", ""post"": ""Joe\u2026. do you just not post comments by some of us, but allow dozens and dozens of comments by others, to try and make a point?"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""20th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""2:49"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""A Bucs Fan"", ""post"": ""I realize it shouldnt be this way but I am relieved that Antoine is out.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/theyre-in-there-coaching-at-teaching/|“They’re In There Coaching And Teaching”|So Bucs inside linebackers coach Larry Foote acknowledged the trauma yesterday endured by Bucs fans and players. Since Foote and the Bucco Bruce Arians regime arrived in 2019 with defensive coordinator Todd Bowles, the Bucs haven’t been “lit up like that on defense early in the year,” as they were this fall, per Foote. Yes, it was jarring. The recent defensive comeback over the past four games, per Foote, is very much attributed to the creativity of Todd Bowles and leadership. Foote specifically mentioned injured safeties Jordan Whitehead and Antoine Winfield, Jr. “They’re in there coaching and teaching,” he said. Frankly, Joe thinks two big parts of the defensive improvement are Lavonte David stepping up his game and Bowles not being less scared to blitz because Jamel Dean returned four weeks ago. Regardless, Joe was very happy to hear about Winfield and Whitehead being so committed. Their “coaching and teaching” should at least keep them mentally sharp for their projected postseason returns.|2024-12-20 11:40:00|162|21|7|Larry Foote|Defensive improvement through coaching and leadership.|5|Mixed reactions with some optimism and some skepticism about team performance and upcoming games.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Saskbucs"", ""post"": ""Hopefully Edwards, Izien and Tykee are ready to go this week.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/i-love-us-force-feeding-the-ball-to-mike/|“I Love Us Force Feeding The Ball To Mike”|Is giving Mike Evans a hearty number of targets a winning formula for Tampa Bay? This year it is. When Evans has 10 or more targets, the Bucs are 3-0. But they weren’t winners last year when Evans got double-digit throws his way. Joe suspects that shift has something to do with the Bucs having a great rushing attack this year versus last year’s vomit-inducing operation. Former Bucs tight end Cameron Brate liked seeing Evans get 11 targets against the Chargers on Sunday. So did Joe, if for no other reason than Evans getting only five targets versus the Raiders a week prior was a travesty. “Obviously, I love us force feeding the ball to Mike,” Brate told the Buccaneers Radio Network. “Good things happen when we do that.” Brate collects a check from Team Glazer for his weekly analysis, so the “force feed” term intrigued Joe. What is Brate seeing or knowing about the Bucs’ approach that may not be apparent to the amateur eye? Joe hopes there’s another 10 targets for Evans on Sunday night in Dallas. First, Evans is hot and healthy now. Second, with three regular-season games remaining, he needs 251 more yards to hit 1,000 yards or more receiving for the 11th consecutive season. That would tie Jerry Rice’s all-time record. As for force feeding receivers, Joe looks for the Cowboys to do just that with Cee Dee Lamb. Their Pro Bowl stud is 22 catches from breaking the all-time NFL record of most catches in a player’s first five seasons — 510 by Michael Thomas.|2024-12-20 11:07:00|261|36|8|Mike Evans|Force-feeding Evans leads to Bucs' success; breaking records in reach.|8|Overall optimistic sentiment towards Bucs history, current team, and players with some critical reflections.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""BA\u2019s Red Pen"", ""post"": ""Throw the ball to Mike MF\u2019ing Evans.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/luke-goedeke-wait-till-you-see-the-future/|Luke Goedeke: Wait Till You See The Future|So, what is the best position unit of the Bucs? Which area is playing the best? Well, Joe supposes one could say defensive tackles. Teams don’t run well on Vita Vea and Calijah Kancey is really balling out. Aside from that, it’s a toss-up between the running backs and the offensive line. But when you factor in Baker Mayfield has time to throw because of the line and the running backs are being aided by the offensive line, Joe would lean … offensive line. Yesterday speaking to the local pen and mic club, Bucs right tackle Luke Goedeke suggested if you think the line is playing well now, just wait. “This is our first year in the offense, so I feel like we’re continuing to grow with time,” Goedeke said. “We have two new guys on the O-line who haven’t played next to each other, with Graham [Barton] and Ben [Bredeson], so it’s about getting them more familiarized. “We’re already starting to click more and more, so I think with time, it will only continue to get better and better.” Very strong point by Goedeke. Let’s think about this for a moment. While Barton is certainly talented, he’s got room to grow. He’s starting to get flag-happy. Not good. But let’s be real. Barton is a rookie. Does anyone really believe he’s already hit his ceiling? Wait until he gets a full offseason in an NFL weight room. He’ll be a different guy next year. Then there is Ben Bredeson. He came from a rotten team. Joe bets there is still room for Bredeson to work the Giants out of him. (Hat tip legendary former JoeBucsFan.com commenter “Thomas 2.2.”) And yeah, the Bucs offensive line as a whole likely has only scratched the surface of what offensive line coach Kevin Carberry has in store — provided he doesn’t bolt if offensive coordinator Liam Coen gets a head coaching gig. So yeah, Joe thinks Goedeke is really onto something here.|2024-12-20 07:00:00|329|28|7|Luke Goedeke|Bucs offensive line shows strong potential for growth.|5|Mixed opinions on retaining Coen, uncertainty about team performance, and future prospects.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""BucU"", ""post"": ""Need a BIG performance from these fellas Sunday night."", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""20th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""7:16"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Bucnjim"", ""post"": ""For so many years during the history of the Bucs the offensive line was average or below.

Or more to the point, former Bucs quarterback Dan Orlovsky of ESPN brings viewers into the world of virtual reality, NFL style! Retired eight-year NFL receiver Andrew Hawkins and Orlovsky set up the scene: Mayfield is about to throw his 35-yard touchdown to Evans against the Chargers. Viewers are in shotgun formation right behind Graham Barton and also inside the helmet of Evans at the line of scrimmage. Orlovsky shows what Mayfield sees and what Mayfield is looking for in determining where he should go with the ball. Then, Orlovsky shows, from Evans’ vantage point, what he’s looking at and why he ran his route the way he did. Joe found this to be really cool.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/liam-coens-future/|Liam Coen’s Future|So all week long the talk around One Buc Palace was which team is going to pluck offensive coordinator Liam Coen away from the Bucs. Joe is happy people caught on. Joe has been typing about this since at least October that Coen was going to be a head coach somewhere next year, college or NFL. However, Joe thinks all Bucs fans can agree that losing Coen would be a major, major hit to the franchise. Maybe the Bucs find the next Coen? Maybe the Bucs find the next Dave Canales? Maybe the Bucs find the next Byron Leftwich (God help us all). So as smart and educated Bucs fans heard on the recent edition of the “Ira Kaufman Podcast,” Joe wondered aloud that Coen may not be interested in any of the current open jobs or ones that fans expect to be open. Would Coen be good coaching aging drama queen Aaron Rodgers? He’s played better of late but if the Jets keep him, he’s got, what, one year left? Then you’re back to square-one looking for a quarterback. And that Jets roster has a lot of holes. The Giants? The Raiders? Trash teams without a quarterback. That’s career suicide. Joe could see Coen working with the Patriots. Really good rookie quarterback and Coen is from Rhode Island. The Bears? Sure, they’ve got a quarterback and receivers and the rest of the roster is trash. Fully dysfunctional organization. So maybe there is a chance Coen will stay because most open jobs won’t have a quarterback. Why not wait for an opening with a team that has a good quarterback and a decent organization? (That’s why New England scares Joe, if there is an opening.) However, yesterday Coen claimed when he came to Tampa Bay, Baker Mayfield wasn’t a lock to return. Besides, Coen said, the Bucs job was too good to pass up, Mayfield or not. “[Mayfield] obviously had a lot to do with it, even though I wanted to be here regardless at that time,” Coen said, acknowledging that when he signed with the Bucs, Mayfield was headed to free agency (as was Mike Evans). “This was an opportunity I definitely couldn’t pass up, regardless of the quarterback situation, although that was a very nice cherry on top when it ended up working out that way.” So Joe really wonders how important it is for Coen to have a quarterback in place when he’s looking at head coaching gigs. On face value, a situation without a quarterback — with no sure-fire quarterback prospects in the 2025 draft — appears to be a doomed job. If a quarterback is important to Coen, well, there won’t be many openings with a built-in franchise quarterback. So perhaps that would persuade Coen to stick around Tampa for a better gig, sort of what Lions offensive coordinator Ben Johnson did last year? Coen did admit yesterday that being a head coach is a career goal of his.|2024-12-20 00:02:00|494|44|5|Liam Coen|Uncertainty about Coen's potential departure and future head coaching prospects.|5|Mixed sentiments with some positivity but also skepticism and uncertainty.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""A Bucs Fan"", ""post"": ""It\u2019s good to have goals.
