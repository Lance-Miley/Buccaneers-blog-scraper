https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/11/teams-are-going-to-start-to-catch-on/|“Teams Are Going To Start To Catch On”|Joe is ecstatic about the Bucs offense thriving through two games without Mike Evans and Chris Godwin. It’s damn impressive.Others have a different view. Take ex-Bucs quarterback Chris Simms, the NBC analyst. He’s a fan of Tampa Bay and loves how the Bucs have turned Cade Otton into their top option and found ways to thrive throwing to running backs.But Simms thinks the success will be fleeting.“Teams are going to start to catch on and slow that down and it’s going to make it tough sledding for the Buccaneers,” Simms said on Pro Football Talk.Then Simms let his frustration show.“It stinks,” he said. “The Buccaneers are a playoff team but I don’t know if they can survive these injuries and where they are in this stretch of the schedule right now.”As for Sunday against the 49ers (4-4), Simms talked about how he considered that the Bucs (4-5) might get blown out in Tampa. But Simms, who is close friends with Niners head coach Kyle Shanahan and follows the team closely, said he released that thought because San Francisco has been too inconsistent.“They find ways to let teams stay in a game too often,” he said.Joe will disagree with Simms that the NFL is going to catch up to the Bucs’ re-worked offense.If you have a smart playcaller, a strong offensive line, a Pro Bowl quarterback and solid skill players, NFL defenses shouldn’t figure you out.The Bucs have all those things.|2024-11-08 18:29:00|240|40|7|Joe|Bucs offense thriving but concerns about teams catching on.|6| Mixed sentiments on team performance and coaching decisions|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""FlBoy84"", ""post"": ""It\u2019s only natural D\u2019s will start to see patterns and make adjustments, but do feel Simms is overlooking the intelligence of Coen & Co and their ability to adjust as well.

He’s a massive human. Really strong. Very fast. He’s quick and agile for his size.“He brings energy to the whole defense. Yes, I have ran into him before. I bounced off. It was great.”Kittle said fundamentals tell him to go low if trying to block Vea, but he doubts that will help him if the two cross paths on Sunday.“Maybe I will get my pad level down,” Kittle said. “I don’t know if that will help at all.”If Joe was Todd Bowles and he heard Kittle say this, Joe would try to devise a defense to match up Vea on Kittle.* — Kittle was being very sarcastic in his initial reaction to locking horns with Vea.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/11/historic-performance-by-liam-coen/|Historic Performance By Liam Coen?|For now, Joe will take the word of an old man with a ton of experience calling plays in the NFL.If the Bucs’ success on offense continues, Joe will dive deep into the hard research.As a first-time NFL playcaller introducing a new offense to a team, Bucs offensive coordinator Liam Coen has his club averaging 28.8 points per game.That ranks fifth in the NFL and is even slightly more impressive than it used to be considering scoring is down in the league over the past 1 1/2 seasons.Bucco Bruce Arians told Barstool Gambling that what Coen is accomplishing is more than just damn good. He praised Coen for doing a job that might be historic.“I don’t know if I’ve ever seen anybody averaging close to 30 points a game in a first-year takeover — in a new offense,” Arians said. “So it’s a credit to the guys buying in.”Joe just started the process of researching the performances of new NFL playcallers and first-year takeovers with a new offense. But is a little leery. Documenting Coen’s special season might help Coen move on after this season. And Joe wants no part of that.Late in the 2015 season, Joe researched then-playcaller Dirk Koetter achieving the super-rare feat of leading a top-10 offense for three different NFL franchises.Making that news public prompted a call from Koetter’s agent to Joe, which led to Joe learning about Koetter’s quest for a head coaching job. (And it also led to securing a nice chunk of inside information over time.)So yeah, Joe’s a little nervous about hyping Coen. The thought of him leaving Tampa should make any Bucs fan nauseous or worse.|2024-11-08 15:10:00|275|38|7|Liam Coen|Impressive debut as Bucs offensive coordinator amidst slight skepticism.|2| Mixed sentiments on Liam Coen possibly leaving Tampa Bay for a head coach position.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Dave Pear"", ""post"": ""Relax.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/11/gerald-mccoy-dont-increase-bucky-irvings-workload/|Gerald McCoy: Don’t Increase Bucky Irving Workload|Six-time Bucs Pro Bowl defensive tackle Gerald McCoy looks at electric rookie running back Bucky Irving and thinks of another famous fourth-round draft pick.No, it’s not Anthony Nelson. McCoy’s brain goes to Titans running back Tony Pollard, the former Cowboys standout.McCoy told KNBR radio this week that he sees Irving as a speed guy in the mold of Pollard, only smaller. And McCoy thinks if Irving gets more work than he has now, something many Bucs fans want, then a Pollard-like dropoff would be forthcoming.Dallas made Pollard its bellcow back last year after a 2022 Pro Bowl as as more of a role player. His production nosedived.McCoy doesn’t want Irving to have the same fate.“When you put all of the carries on his back, then you’ll get to see who he really is,” McCoy said of Irving. “Right now, I like him in the role he’s in. … Leave him in the role’s he’s in. Don’t put too much on him too early because what he’s doing right now is working.”Well, Joe is glad the Bucs have a diverse corps of running backs, but Joe would still give Irving more opportunities. Some backs thrive with more touches.Irving has averaged 13 touches per game over the last five weeks. It should hurt Irving or the Bucs to have that kick up a few notches.|2024-11-08 14:13:00|223|23|5|Gerald McCoy|McCoy cautions against increasing workload for rookie Bucky Irving.|8| Mixed emotions on running backs' roles but consensus on Tucker's potential and injury concerns.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Lt.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/11/the-nfl-in-2024-dink-and-dunk-works/|The NFL In 2024: Dink-And-Dunk Works|It wasn’t long ago that Joe used to cringe thinking about a short-passing offense.Joe was more of a Bucco Bruce Arians, Dirk Koetter kind of a guy. Get those receivers deep and let ‘er rip!No risk it; no biscuit!Liam Coen is not that kind of guy. Or, the Bucs’ offensive coordinator built a short-passing offense because that style gets the most out of Baker Mayfield’s talents?Whatever the motivation, it’s working well enough that Joe is pretty convinced Coen will be working elsewhere as a head coach in 2025.Joe doesn’t want to see Coen go, but hey, if Dave Canales can get a gig after one year as Bucs offensive coordinator, so should Coen. His offense is putting up much better numbers.What surprised Joe is that the Mayfield/Coen duo is doing this with a dink-and-dunk offense. Joe has documented each week Mayfield’s passing and not very often does he throw farther than 20 yards downfield.Again, Joe cannot quibble. The offense is working.This short-passing may be a trend. Someone who goes by the handle of @Doug_Analytics put out a chart of the 36 top quarterbacks for attempting passes 20 yards downfield. Joe was a bit surprised to see Mayfield at No. 31.“Surprised,” meaning Joe didn’t think Mayfield’s numbers would be that low.Among other quarterbacks who had similarly few long pass attempts, Pat Mahomes ranked No. 36! Jayden Daniels is No. 22 and below him are Dak Prescott (23) Matt Stafford (26) Joe Burrow (29) and Jared Goff (35).Those are are damn good quarterbacks — with numbers throwing deep right around Mayfield’s rate.So you can win running a dink-and-dunk offense.

And Bucs offensive coordinator Liam Coen understands why some would think his offense could never recover after losing Mike Evans and Chris Godwin to injuries three weeks ago.But damn it, Coen said yesterday, the Bucs offense still has talented guys that can make clutch plays. So this team isn’t dead yet.“It’s like, ‘Hey, man, we’ve got some good players, too,'” Coen said yesterday at One Buc Palace. “These guys can still compete and win – they have confidence. I need to maybe have a little bit more confidence in some ways, to be a little bit more explosive with some calls, maybe in some ways.“But yeah, it’s just funny when you’re on the sidelines and [Sterling Shepard] is running up to you yelling at you to throw a ball because he’s got a lot of confidence.“And you know, in that two-minute drill, we hit him on the corner route on our sideline, and that was after a stoppage of clock, and he runs over and he’s like, ‘I can toast them.’ And I said, ‘Alright, let’s go,’ and I called the play for him in the moment to win.”Shepard is balling and his enthusiasm for the game is rubbing off on teammates, Coen noted. “He’s infectious, you know, in the way that he’s playing.”Evans is expected to come back, perhaps Nov. 24 against the Giants in New Jersey, the first game after the bye week.It’s great that Bucs skill position players are so confident and eager to make plays. As down as this team was after that Baltimore beatdown, in which Evans and Godwin were lost, the Bucs needed someone like Shepard to infuse life back into the roster.Ira Kaufman Talks Fan Disenchantment, The 2-Point Saga, Expectations, Liam Coen, And More

He didn’t practice Wednesday yesterday, though those were walk-through sessions and not real practices.On Wednesday, Mayfield said he was a little banged up but seemed confident he would play Sunday against the 49ers. Yesterday, Bucs offensive coordinator Liam Coen said he believed Mayfield would play.“He just took a bunch more [walk-through] reps today, actually,” Coen said.Despite the injury report Wednesday saying he didn’t practice, Coen said Mayfield got some throws in.“He’ll be fine,” Coen said. “He’s moving around a lot better today than he was over the last few days. I’ve been kind of [saying] quick, little [jabs], ‘Hey man, you ain’t going to be able to run this week? You feeling a little slow this week?

But Shanahan told KNBR-AM 680 in San Francisco yesterday that McCaffrey has had no setbacks and he should be able to handle a full load against the Bucs.“He’s been awesome these last two days,” Shanahan said. “Hopefully that continues to go well. I expect to get him out there.”That’s all the Bucs need is for one of the best running backs in the game to be fresh when he hits the turf Sunday.A reader of Joe’s mused on Twitter yesterday that the Bucs always seemed to do well against McCaffrey when he was with Carolina.Joe sort of agreed but also pointed out that playing running back for Riverboat Ron Rivera and Matt Rhule is a bit different than playing running back for Shanahan.Last year McCaffrey had 105 yards from scrimmage against the Bucs with a touchdown catch. In 2022, McCaffrey had 119 yards rushing and 34 yards receiving with a touchdown catch.So yeah, this isn’t great news for the Bucs.|2024-11-08 05:00:00|214|16|8|Kyle Shanahan|McCaffrey returns from injury to face Bucs.|3| Mixed sentiments towards team decisions|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""NY_Buc"", ""post"": ""Joe will we get 10 articles on going for 2 tonight also did not work like you did last week against the Bucs decision not to go for 2?"", ""post_time"": ""November 8th, 2024 at 12:10 am""}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""NY_Buc"", ""post"": ""Maybe a few articles that the Bengals should fire their coach?

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/11/five-of-their-last-eight-against-2-win-football-teams/|“Five Of Their Last Eight Against 2-Win Football Teams”|"There are soft schedules, and then there are cotton-ball, baby-bunny-soft schedules. The Bucs’ have the latter to close the 2024 season. Retired Pro Bowl quarterback Alex Smith was on SiriusXM NFL Radio today talking with his co-host about how the Bucs play “five of their last eight [games] against 2-win football teams.”It’s a stunning reality.And it’s why Smith thinks the Bucs (4-5) are a likely playoff team, he said, especially if Tampa Bay can find a “W” at home Sunday against the 49ers before the Bucs’ bye week.Like every former QB with working eyes, Smith sees Baker Mayfield playing very well and a Bucs team with enough offense to knock off the NFL’s basement clubs routinely, especially with Mike Evans slated to return.Consider that the Bucs’ final three games are against the sinking Cowboys (3-5), with Dak Prescott now facing hamstring surgery, the slimy Saints (2-7) in tanking mode, and the Panthers (2-7).What a cupcake finish!Before that, it’s the two-win Giants. They rank last in the NFL in scoring at 15.4 points per game. Also on the schedule is the two-win Raiders, another game against the Panthers, and a trip to visit a tough Chargers team.To make the scene more fun, the Raiders come to Tampa in December for a 1 p.m. game following a trip to Kansas City. That’s a bad combination for a west coast team. Bucco Bruce Arians himself was on Barstool Gambling last week talking about how players on bad teams routinely check out around Thanksgiving.If the Bucs stay relatively healthy and can’t find six more wins on their schedule, then the Bucs’ coaching staff will deserve the blinding spotlight that will descend upon it.Ira Kaufman Talks Fan Disenchantment, The 2-Point Saga, Expectations, Liam Coen, And More
