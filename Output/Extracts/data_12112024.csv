https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/19-players-on-bucs-injury-report/|19 Players On Bucs’ Injury Report|It’s that time of year, but 19 is a big number.  That’s how many guys are on the official Buccaneers injury report issued today, the first of the week before Sunday’s game at the Los Angeles Chargers. Consider that the Bucs also have 10 players officially on injured reserve. Tampa Bay isn’t the only banged up team in the league and many players are just resting/healing for Sunday, but that doesn’t mean they’re 100 percent. One noteworthy name for Joe on the list is starting edge rusher Joe Tryon-Shoyinka, who has missed the past two games with a bad hamstring. Was he missed? He is listed as full-go for practicing. Also, defensive back Christian Izien not practicing with a groin injury seems like a new development. The Bucs are counting on him to start at safety Sunday as Antoine Winfield, Jr. will be out at least two weeks with a knee injury suffered Sunday against the Raiders.|2024-12-11 19:44:00|157|34|'4|Bucs|Injury concerns for Buccaneers ahead of Sunday's game.'|3|Pessimistic tone with concerns about injuries impacting team performance.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Bucsfan81"", ""post"": ""Nothing like fielding a team that is handicap and in wheel chairs.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/weekday-communicator-baker-mayfield/|Weekday Communicator Baker Mayfield|Interesting insight into the Bucs’ franchise quarterback.  Tight end Cade Otton (Pro Bowler?) hopped on SiriusXM NFL Radio recently and explained that Baker Mayfield is an A+ communicator. He said there are so many examples during weekday practices. And by the time a game rolls around, per Otton, pass catchers know what Mayfield is thinking versus certain defensive looks. “An eight-play period in practice, afterwards we get back behind the plays and he just talks through what he’s seeing,” Otton said. “… Over time that just allows for chemistry to grow and it’s the type of leader he is. … Everyone on the team can really testify to that.” Joe has heard from players how detailed Mayfield is in a regular-guy, we’re-in-this-together way, versus how Tom Brady was more serious and business-like. Only four teams this season have scored more than the Bucs, whose offense has survived various injuries. That’s quite an accomplishment with a new offensive coordinator. So Mayfield is clearly getting his messages through.|2024-12-11 17:08:00|166|11|8|Baker Mayfield|Baker Mayfield excels as a communicator leading the Bucs' offense.|6|Mix of optimism and praise for Baker and the Bucs, with some realistic expectations.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Mike C"", ""post"": ""Imagine if they still had CG smh"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""11th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""5:42"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""The Truth be Told"", ""post"": ""Baker and the Bucs.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/is-the-bucs-offense-dangerous-todd-bowles-explains/|Is The Bucs’ Offense “Dangerous?” Todd Bowles Explains|Do the Bucs have a dangerous offense? Depends how you look at it. Bucco Bruce Arians appeared on the “Scoop City” podcast recently and said that unless an offense can average 28 points a game, it is screwed. As a result, the Bucs are a cat’s whisker away from being dangerous. The Bucs average 27.9 points a game, fifth-best in the league. So how does Bucs coach Todd Bowles describe his offense? It’s not dangerous, Bowles said. Not yet, at least. “We’re getting there, yes.” After losing four straight (with Jamel Dean out of the lineup), the Bucs have since bounced back and have won three straight. If they can win three of the next four games, the Bucs (7-6) just may have enough wins to secure the NFC South. Anything less, and it could be really tight for the Bucs. It would help on Sunday if the Bucs offense can explode for 30 points. That may be tough sledding against the Chargers as they allow a league-low 15.9 points a game. Only three times this season have the Chargers allowed 20 or more points. So this week, “dangerous” could mean the Bucs score anywhere in the 20s. But hey, if the Bucs can pull off a win, then there should be noe argument who should win the NFC South.|2024-12-11 16:24:00|220|27|7|The Bucs|"Bucs offense nearing ""dangerous"" territory"|5|Mixed sentiments with hope for improvement and concerns about consistency and injuries.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""JimBobBuc"", ""post"": ""Bucs need to win out to control their destiny.

Licht made it sound like it could be longer but not into the postseason. “Antoine, he’s going to miss some time here,” Licht said. “Definitely miss a couple of weeks, could be a little bit longer. If we make the playoffs, which obviously is our goal now, we should have him back. Maybe could be back a little bit sooner.  We’re taking it a day at a time or a week at a time here. Yeah, that’s a tough one.” It sure is a tough one.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/chasing-mike-alstott/|Chasing Mike Alstott|It’s almost hard to believe Rachaad White has only one running back/fullback ahead of him for an all-time Buccaneers’ record. White is a third-year player, but after Sunday, he ranks second in Bucs history for touchdown receptions by Tampa Bay running backs/fullbacks. The all-time leader is the A-Train himself, Mike Alstott, whose name sits in the Buccaneers Ring of Honor after his 11 seasons in pewter and red (1996-2006). (Joe also will not that Alstott is a proud Bill Currie Ford customer.) Speaking on the Buccaneers Radio Network yesterday, head coach Todd Bowles raved about White’s all-around and physical performance Sunday against the Raiders. He also said White doesn’t get enough credit for being a smart player. “He’s pretty much a wide receiver back there, with moves and big enough to be a running back, as well,” Bowles said of White. “So he can do a lot of things. He has a lot of jobs. … He’s benefited a lot of guys being double-teamed, and he’s benefited from the fact that that he’s very good in the open field, and he has outstanding hands. And he has a very good feel for the game; he doesn’t get enough credit for how mentally smart he is when he plays a ballgame, but he’s a very smart player.” High praise for White, who has improved this season and may have just played the best game of his 49-game career. It would be wild if White caught Alstott’s franchise record for TD catches this season. Joe wouldn’t bet against it.|2024-12-11 10:48:00|257|46|8|Rachaad White|White chasing Mike Alstott's franchise record for TD catches.|6|Mixed sentiments with some positive comments but also some confusion and criticism.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""JimBobBuc"", ""post"": ""While Bucky and White support each other, I think the competition for snaps has given White incentive to play better.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/the-falcons-feel-like-frauds/|“The Falcons Feel Like Frauds”|Joe will take it however it’s given. If it takes the Dixie Chicks to lose out and the Bucs to limp their way to a flaccid division title, so be it. Hosting a playoff game is better than watching one from your couch. The Bucs (7-6) painted themselves into the corner in which they now stand by and not taking care of business at least once against Atlanta (6-7) and by losing four games in a row to hit their Week 12 bye. In a roundtable discussion of NFL topics for The Athletic, Zac Keefer, Mike Sando and Jeff Howe discussed the NFC South. All three think the Bucs have an edge. Zac Keefer: I like Tampa Bay’s chances in the NFC South simply because the Falcons feel like frauds. Atlanta’s been so wildly inconsistent this season, and Kirk Cousins is amid one of the worst slumps of his career. The Bucs, meanwhile, [only] see [one] team with a winning record the rest of the regular season. Jeff Howe: If the Bucs take care of business, they should win four of their last five games and take the NFC South. Their defensive inconsistencies are concerning because it’s tough to rip off a winning streak like that, but their schedule is the most accommodating compared to the Seahawks and Cardinals. Mike Sando: Tampa Bay is the team for me as well. It’s amazing to me the Bucs lost twice to the Falcons, but they did, and that’s why they’re in this position. The Athletic’s model puts the Bucs’ playoff chances at 54 percent, compared to 35 percent for Arizona and 26 percent for the Rams. That feels about right to me. Howe makes a great point about the defensive inconsistencies. If the Bucs had a solid defense with their run game, this division would just about be over. Zero edge rush — and Joe means zee-ROW edge rush — with injuries to starters in the secondary is not normally a recipe for success. Luckily, the Bucs can play keepaway with a solid run game. If the Bucs can just play decent defense, Joe will feel much more comfortable about all of this.|2024-12-11 09:00:00|361|38|7|Falcons|Bucs favored in NFC South playoff race.|3|Mixed sentiments with frustration, hope, and skepticism among fans about team performance and playoffs.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Baking with Coen"", ""post"": ""We need more healthy defenders.

It is a West Coast game, usually not good for the Bucs, The Chargers have a tough defense, although apparantly weak against the run. Herbert is a much more danderous qb than the Bucs have faced in awhile and lighting up the secondary especially with no pash rush seems likely. With that said if the Bucs can rely on the ground game and Baker is safe with the ball the Bucs have a chance. Dallas, well that game could go either way. I think with Derek Carr now out, believe the Bucs  at home will likely sweep the Saints. However, yes believe it or not it could be Car that beats the Bucs. They have been playing much better as of late and their defense has been rising to the occasion. They are hungry and this is a div. game so sweeping them is no certainity.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/incredible-turnaround-for-bucs-run-game/|Incredible Turnaround For Bucs Run Game|The Bucs were horrible running the ball in the past two seasons. The worst. Now if a team with a new coordinator can take a running game from worst to average, that is a helluva improvement. Bucs offensive coordinator Liam Coen has done even better. The Bucs rank No. 6 in rushing yards per game, (138.3), No. 8 in total rushing yards (1,798), No. 4 in average yards per run (5.1). That’s an incredible turnaround. Will that continue against the Chargers in Los Angeles on Sunday? Well, Joe heard people on national podcasts talk about how the Chargers are playing good defense. Really? Not against the run. The Chargers rank No. 14 in the NFL in rushing years allowed per game at 117.6, tied with the Raiders. On Sunday, the Bucs ran against Las Vegas ran for 152 yards with an average of 5.8 yards a carry. And that was without dinged up Bucky Irving, who had just three yards on four carries. Joe knows Jesse Minter is a good defensive coordinator for the Chargers and has a solid resume. His name is being floated for head coach opening, but he has work to do with his run defense. The Chargers have allowed over 100 yards rushing in 9 of their last 11 games. Nine times in the Bucs’ past 10 games the team has run for over 100 yards. So Joe doesn’t see the success of the Bucs’ run game slowing down. At least not this Sunday. https://twitter.com/baldynfl/status/1866601292879028579|2024-12-11 07:00:00|249|30|'8|Bucs Run Game|Bucs improve running game dramatically|7|Overall positive sentiment with praise for coaching, improvement in performance, and playoff aspirations.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Leighroy"", ""post"": ""It\u2019s also impressive that the running game turnaround has been achieved without a running QB.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/a-lot-of-people-think-he-may-retire-at-the-end-of-the-year/|“A Lot Of People Think He May Retire At The End Of The Year”|UPDATED 5:35 a.m. — Well, this is a juicy item dropped by a former NFL suit who is very tight with Bill Belichick. One thing is certain when listening to the podcast GM Shuffle hosted by Michael Lombardi, the former NFL general manager and coffee fetcher for Bill Walsh, Al Davis and Bill Belichick. The former Browns shot-caller rarely speaks ill of someone from the branch of the Bill Parcells/Bill Belichick coaching tree. And that would include Bucs coach Todd Bowles, a former Parcells disciple. Remember, Parcells called Bowles one of his “homeboys” two years ago. For example, don’t you dare even hint to Lombardi that Belichick never won a Super Bowl ring as a head coach without Tom Brady but Brady won a ring without Belichick. Remind Lombardi of this at your own peril and brace for a fire and brimstone sermon the likes of which would make a holy roller preacher blush. Currently, Lombardi is the biggest cheerleader for Mike Vrabel to get a new head coaching job. The way Lombardi talks up Vrabel, the former Belichick player who also was a defensive coordinator at Houston for Bill O’Brien, you’d think Vrabel is Andy Reid or Sean McVay. Being such a defender of the Parcells/Belichick tree wins favors for Lombardi, who is an intimate of Belichick. That’s why the following is so intriguing to Joe. When breaking down the Bucs’ win over the Raiders on Sunday, unprovoked, Lombardi dropped the following line while praising Bowles for finding a way to win on a day when his quarterback struggled and a third of his starting defense was hurt. “Give Todd Bowles credit,” Lombardi began. “Everybody thinks he’s not going to keep his job. A lot of people think he may retire at the end of the year.” Well now, that’s the first Joe heard of a potential Bowles retirement in a matter of weeks. Lombardi didn’t say who exactly claims Bowles might quit in January or February. Now Joe is going to be two-bit detective here. Last year Bowles, almost flippantly, said the Bucs will be the last team he coaches. Joe followed up by asking Bowles if he planned to retire. No, said Bowles, who turned 61 last month. But Bowles told Joe that the Bucs will be his last head coaching job. Whenever he leaves, for whatever reason, that’s it. He’s done. Tampa Bay will be his last rodeo. Could this be the genesis of Lombardi’s statement? Someone read Joe’s article or heard Bowles say this last year and told someone, who told someone, who tipped off Lombardi over a bottle of Pinot noir at Oscar’s Steakhouse in Vegas with other NFL folks. Or if we want to play TMZ here, did Lombardi get this intel from Belichick, with whom Lombardi does a weekly podcast? If so, how would Belichick know Bowles plans to retire? Fun stuff to chew on as this warm Wednesday morning rolling. Oh, and as far as the Bucs winning, here’s what Lombardi said of Bowles and the job he is doing: “His team is resilient,” Lombardi said. “They fight through it. You know, I’m not saying they are the best team. But they sure as hell are tougher than Atlanta. “This is what Tampa does. They finish the season strong and their toughness shows up.” Lombardi added the Bucs losing to the Dixie Chicks in Atlanta earlier this season was a lucky accident for Atlanta. UPDATE 5:35 a.m.: Joe got in touch with Todd Bowles about Lombardi’s comments this morning and Bowles was emphatic about his coaching status. “Definitely not retiring,” he said.|2024-12-11 03:45:00|601|61|6|Todd Bowles|Speculation about Todd Bowles potentially retiring at end of year.|3|Comments are mixed on Todd Bowles, with some advocating for his retirement or demotion.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""BillyBucco"", ""post"": ""Belicheck has probably been digging.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/baker-mayfield-passing-chart-week-14/|Baker Mayfield Passing Chart Week 14|Again, Joe loves Bucs offensive coordinator Liam Coen. How could you not? What Coen has done for this Tampa Bay offense — running, throwing, blocking — is just incredible. The offense has improved in every area imaginable. So the following may sound like nitpicking, but Joe believes it is relevant. It’s pretty well documented that Coen runs a dink-and-dunk offense. And last week may have been the week Baker Mayfield threw his highest percentages of short passes this season, despite Mike Evans playing. Mayfield threw just two passes farther than 20 yards from the line of scrimmage. The two were 25- and 26-yards long. And as Woody Hayes famously said about passing, only three things can happen and two are bad. … Mayfield threw an incompletion and an interception on his two passes longer than 20 yards. Again, the offense is working very well. So this is almost like asking to fix something that is not broken. But this dink-and-dunk method in the long run may just cost Mike Evans his coveted streak.|2024-12-11 00:00:00|173|11|4|Baker Mayfield|Mayfield throws short passes|3|Mixed feedback on QB play, WR usage, deep ball, and offensive adjustments.

Primarily the 2 names that are slightly ahead of him in passing are Joe Burrow and Lamar Jackson. Baker has too many INTs at 13, but not sure how these affected the outcome of games.
