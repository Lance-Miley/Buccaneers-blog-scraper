https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/record-chasing-stats-loading-cade-otton/|Record-Chasing, Stats-Loading Cade Otton|So consider that among NFL tight ends this season, Bucs No. 1 tight end Cade Otton ranks seventh in total catches (57), seventh in yards (576) and fourth in completions of 20 yards more. And Otton is a every-down player with a big role in the Buccaneers’ punishing run game. What a fourth-round draft pick Otton has turned out to be. And he’s durable and an ultimate-team-guy kind of dude. The future is very bright for the 25-year-old out of the University of Washington. Man, there would have been no place for with the party-first Bucs of the Raheem Morris era. Somewhat ironically, Otton is chasing one of the team-last Bucs tight ends of years past: Kellen “I’m in prison” Winslow. The Bucs single-season record for catches by a tight end is held by Winslow, who got the Vaseline off his hands long enough to haul in 77 balls in the 2009 season. Otton has an outside shot at the record. Winslow also has the second-highest Bucs season total with 75 catches in 2011. Regardless, Otton had a strong game yesterday and his having a hell of a season. Joe suspects the scouting gurus at One Buc Palace didn’t see Otton as a 70-catch, 750-yard guy when he was drafted in 2022. He’s about to prove them wrong — and maybe even make the Pro Bowl along the way.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/injuries-are-unpredictable/|Injuries Are Unpredictable|From time to time on this here website over the years, Joe sees a comment from a Bucs fan wanting to run the Bucs’ training staff because the fan(s) directly blames trainers at the AdventHealth Hamstring Center for injuries. Football is a contact sport. Injuries happen. Sometimes in bunches, sometimes few. There usually is no rhyme or reason. As Joe always says, if someone has a new formula to prevent injuries and get production out of the same players, that person with said magic formula could make millions in the NFL (and college) with this secret sauce. The Bucs are beat to hell right now. They’re down three starters and two backups in the middle of their defense — two starting safeties, one starting inside linebacker and two backup inside linebackers (and that’s not even factoring in Pro Bowl receiver Chris Godwin). Todd Bowles, speaking in his day-after presser today, seems as frustrated as any Bucs fan. “I wish I could tell you,” the head coach said when asked about why so many injuries. “We had this [same practice] schedule last year, we were one of the healthiest teams in the league. And we had the exact same schedule.” So Bowles and his training staff are doing extra work to try to find any connection there may be to how team and prepares and the injuries. “We’re taking a look at everything,” Bowles said. “We’re trying to find if there’s a common denominator and things that we can do better on Friday. “But we had the same schedule last year and everybody was commending us for being one of the healthiest teams in the league.” Joe does know the Bucs had an unusual training camp schedule in that they had back-to-back days off in camp after four practices in a row, something Joe hadn’t seen previously. Bowles said on the “Ira Kaufman Podcast” that trainers showed when the Bucs practiced for a fifth straight day, that’s when injuries began to crop up. Outside of Calijah Kancey blowing out his calf for the second straight training camp, the Bucs were pretty healthy this summer. And the team started 2-0 with good health. So it’s not like the Bucs’ training staff isn’t searching for reasons injuries happen and trying to avoid them. It’s just one of those years.

Today, Todd Bowles said Irving’s back is something the Bucs will work on all week. “It’s tightened up,” Bowles said. “We gotta see how we feel, if we can get it loosened up, he should be ok. If not, we’ll see how the week goes.” Joe hopes the Bucs are careful with Irving, but damn, every week is a Super Bowl for this team.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/update-on-antoine-winfield-injury/|Update On Antoine Winfield Injury|Well, it’s not good but it’s not a disaster, either. Bucs coach Todd Bowles offered an update today on the knee injury of All-Pro safety Antoine Winfield. Sounds like he may miss a game or two. Bowles said Winfield has “a knee sprain,” and “will be out a little while.” Bowles added Winfield may be out “a couple of weeks.” Based on knee sprains that Vita Vea and Tristan Wirfs had this year, Winfield could miss two games. Vea missed one game with a knee sprain he suffered at Detroit. Wirfs had a knee sprain playing against San Francisco and missed the Giants game, which came after a bye week. It’s not good news. But it could have been a whole lot worse.|2024-12-09 12:36:00|123|39|5|Antoine Winfield|Winfield has knee sprain|3|Mixed sentiments with frustration, support, and disappointment towards player injuries and performance.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""#1bucsfan"", ""post"": ""Maybe he heals a little faster being a smaller dude.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/we-aint-really-used-to-care-about-football/|“We Ain’t Really Used To Care About Football”|If you’ve been a Bucs fan for more than a dozen years, then you might want to stop reading here if you have a weak stomach or high blood pressure. Joe often refers to The Lost Decade of Buccaneers football as 2009 through 2018. Ten seasons mostly filled with misery. Sadly and unforgiveably, it wasn’t just about poor players and coaches. That was underscored to the extreme today on Up & Adams. That’s where retired Bucs great Rob Gronkowski was a guest listening to former Bucs stud and trouble-maker cornerback Aqib Talib (2008-2012) assessing the struggles of the 2024 Falcons, losers of four consecutive games. Talib pointed a finger at Kirk Cousins and got detailed about his throwing weaknesses before defending Falcons head coach Raheem Morris. “Rah is my guy. I know it ain’t the energy in the [Falcons’] building,” Talib said. “I know it ain’t that. Start with the quarterback play [of Kirk Cousins,] man.” That seemed to spark Gronk into reminding Talib that Morris, the former Bucs head coach (2009-2011), oversaw a mess in Tampa. Here’s the painful exchange for Bucs fans. Gronk: Aqib was part of that era in Tampa, too, where football was like secondary. It was all about the nightlife. Talib: Yeah, yeah. Gronk: It was all about what you were doing off the field from 2008 to 2012. Talib: Our cars. Gronk: I heard about those times in Tampa. Talib: It was all about the parking lot. You know what I’m saying? (laughs) Gronk: Yeah (laughs). Talib: We used to have new-whip Fridays, man. We’d get cars up here on Fridays. It was a car show, man. Gronk: Hey, Thirsty Thursdays on Howard Street. I heard all about it (laughs). Talib: Yeah, Thirsty Thursdays. Hey, I’m tellin’ you. We used to go down there, man. We ain’t really used to care about football. We was just happy to be there. Ugly stuff, especially for all those Bucs fans who spent money they couldn’t afford on tickets, warm beer and parking. It’s amazing how much was tolerated. Joe is so glad Team Glazer has matured as an ownership group and found strong leadership in Buccaneers Ring of Honor general manager Jason Licht. The depth of nonsense in The Lost Decade won’t be repeated under current management. Sure, the Bucs had a fun and successful season in 2010, with a 10-6 record but missing the playoffs, but it’s clear they never had a chance to be great.|2024-12-09 12:18:00|411|37|2|Rob Gronkowski|Bucs reminisce about lackluster past.|4|Mixed sentiment with some negative and positive comments about team, players, and coaches.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""drdneastup"", ""post"": ""Aquib is a complete moron, glad to see Gronkowski slap him down with reality.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/they-dont-have-a-large-margin-for-error-from-a-talent-standpoint/|“They Don’t Have A Large Margin For Error From A Talent Standpoint”|So what are fair expectations for the Bucs as they march toward a fourth consecutive division title? Joe would first respond by saying something like, ‘Screw fair. Play hard. Play smart and coach smart. Wrap up and protect the football. Walk off the field with fans knowing you play a physical, hustling brand of football on every snap. All that doesn’t take talent.’ But that rant aside, NFL expectations are very much about talent. You can’t make a four-course meal without the groceries. After the Bucs win yesterday, Baker Mayfield’s original NFL offensive coordinator, Todd Haley, talked on SiriusXM NFL Radio about being proud of Mayfield’s high points with the Bucs week in and week out while acknowledging Mayfield has to clean up his turnovers. Then Haley, a Todd Bowles fan wh was on the same NFL coaching staff as Bowles years ago, noted that while the Bucs play hard for Bowles, “They don’t have a large margin for error from a talent standpoint.” Joe had trouble swallowing that whole, but it’s painfully accurate, especially so many injuries that include a fresh knee issue for Antoine Winfield, Jr. Joe is not pointing many fingers at Buccaneers Ring of Honor general manager Jason Licht. Yeah, the inside and outside linebacker situation feels mismanaged. But there’s not a ton to criticize outside of that considering the Bucs still are paying off the Tom Brady-era debt this year and, you know, the team is sitting alone in first place with a 7-6 record. Buccaneers Radio Network analyst Dave Moore, the retired Bucs tight end, made a great point on yesterday’s pregame show: It’s now the time of year to improve every week moving toward the playoffs. It’s not enough to just squeak out wins, he said, adding that without steady late-season improvement in various areas, then a team can expect to be punished in the postseason. The Bucs were better yesterday than they were a week ago at Carolina, and they have the enough talent place to be much better against the Chargers on Sunday. The margin for error is slim, but the room for improvement within the current roster talent is large, which Joe finds exciting.|2024-12-09 11:19:00|364|27|5|The Bucs|Striving for improvement with slim margin for error.|3|Fans express frustration with team performance, potential for improvement next season, and injury setbacks.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Rick"", ""post"": ""this was always going to be the case with a lack of premium draft picks due to success and a lack of salary cap room to re-sign certain players and get new free agents"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""9th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""11:29"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""TampaBayBucFan"", ""post"": ""We had talent when we went 4-6\u2026..I\u2019m watching our highly paid CB Jamel Dean missing tackles yesterday\u2026\u2026and our high draft picks unable to achieve a sack."", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""9th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""11:31"", ""am""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""Winny Testaverde"", ""post"": ""Seeing the percentage odds for The Bucs making the playoffs\u2026I take those with a pillar of salt much like KamalToe\u2019s faux polling #\u2019s.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/todd-bowles-bucs-learning-how-to-close-out-wins/|Todd Bowles: Bucs Learning How To Close Out Wins|With a couple of smarter coaching moves and a couple of plays late in games, who knows how many wins the 7-6 Bucs would have right now? In three games this season, before this three-game winning streak after the bye, the Bucs lost on the final drive of the game. In the past two wins, Bucs have needed overtime (Carolina) and to dodge a crisis of no offense after jumping out to a 14-0 lead yesterday against the Raiders. As a result, Bowles said his team is beginning to learn how to win games. “The growth between last week and this week [has] shown how we can come out and close out games and get through the games even when things go bad is a sign of maturity,” Bowles said. The catch here is the injuries. Depending on what the diagnosis is on Antoine Winfield’s knee, the Bucs may be using Kayvon Merriweather and Christian Izien as starting safeties. Jordan Whitehead is on injured reserve with a pec injury. So if the Bucs really are learning how to win close games, they need more solid play from Izien and Merriweather. The Bucs also are down to their third-string inside linebacker (Vi Jones), who for some 11 months was parked on the practice squad as Bowles said he wasn’t ready to play. Right now, those guys need to be ready to produce like starters.|2024-12-09 09:00:00|233|32|7|Todd Bowles|Bucs learning to close out games despite injuries.|5|Mixed sentiments with some optimism and frustration towards players and coaching decisions.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""BucsLV"", ""post"": ""Merriweather showed some glimpses yesterday\u2026 of course it\u2019s a downgrade of our starters, but it wasn\u2019t that bad!"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""9th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""9:03"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Bucfan"", ""post"": ""If only the h/c would learn as well.  \u201cNo risk it NO Biscuit\u201d \u2013 sound familiar?"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""9th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""9:06"", ""am""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""BakerFan"", ""post"": ""Herbert is a different animal than the QB\u2019s the Bucs faced yesterday.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/buccaneers-are-hearty-favorites-to-make-the-playoffs/|Buccaneers Are Hearty Favorites To Make The Playoffs|Computer models across the nation were humming last night, or perhaps that buzz was Ira Kaufman after his bang-the-table Bucs prediction came through. Regardless, the Bucs are not only in first place but are a hearty favorite to host a playoff game. Bring on the Packers! As seen in the NBC Sports data graphic above, the Bucs (7-6) now sit with a 64 percent chance of winning the NFC South, which would represent their fourth straight division title after a Super Bowl. If that sweet dream becomes reality, it would be rare and historic NFL when it comes to maintaining a lasting contender. The sinking Falcons (6-7), losers of four consecutive games, stand in the way. The official NFL data nerds say the Bucs actually have a 71 percent likelihood of reaching the postseason — division title or Wild Card. The math majors at the New York Times insist the Bucs have a 57 percent chance of winning the NFC South and a 67 percent shot at the playoffs. The “C+” math students at JoeBucsFan.com world headquarter put pencil to Twix bar wrappers last night and determined the Bucs have a 96.8 percent shot to make the playoffs if they beat the remaining NFC slugs on their schedule: Dallas, New Orleans and three-win Carolina.|2024-12-09 04:41:00|214|34|9|Buccaneers|Buccaneers are strong favorite to make playoffs.|5|Mixed sentiments, ranging from pessimistic to optimistic, with a focus on playoff scenarios and injuries.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""David S Pear"", ""post"": ""Haha yes indeed.

Not nice enough. Evans racked up 69 yards receiving on 4 catches, including a sweet hurdle of a Raiders defender. Not a bad game. Not good enough. Evans, as we all know, desperately wants to extend his streak of 1,000-yard receiving seasons. He’s never not had 1,000 receiving yards in a season since the Bucs made Evans the No. 7 overall pick of the 2014 NFL draft. After yesterday’s game, Evans now needs 410 yards in the next four games to keep that streak alive. In other words, Evans must average 102.5 yards per game for the historic streak to continue. And the way the Bucs simply do not throw deep, or do their best not to throw deep, it’s going to be a challenge for the Bucs’ greatest offensive player to pull this feat off. |2024-12-09 04:01:00|149|38|5|Mike Evans|Evans needs 410 yards for 1|3|Mixed sentiments with emphasis on prioritizing team success over individual records.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Dlavid"", ""post"": ""This is a non factor !!!

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/five-things-81/|Five Things|Welcome to Victory Monday! That’s three in a row. Joe feels spoiled. So, let’s get after it. Hope you are caffeinated. First Place Bucs Alright, get used to it Bucs fans: First place Bucs! That is a very good thing in the month of December. But how long will it last? The Bucs are a game ahead of the choking Dixie Chicks with four games to go. Next week the Bucs travel to Los Angeles to play the Chargers while Atlanta flies to Vegas to play the rotten Raiders. Both the Bucs and the Dixie Chicks each play only one more decent team. The Bucs play the Chargers; the Dixie Chicks play the Commandos in two weeks. The way Joe looks at it, this is a race to 10. Of course, last night Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert got hurt and suffered a contusion in a loss to the Chiefs, so who knows what condition he will be in. From here on out, it’s the Super Bowl each week. Time To Get Baker Mayfield Right Baker Mayfield is one of the better quarterbacks in the league and is one of the better stories in the league. Yet he is still human. Mayfield is on an ugly streak the past two games against terrible teams, Carolina and Las Vegas. He’s thrown four picks in those games. Joe sort of dismisses one interception from the Carolina game. Joe still blames Bucs coaches for putting Mayfield in the game straight from the peep show tent — after he sat out two plays injured — and then having him pass on third-and-one. Common sense tells you not to put a quarterback in a situation like that and ask him to throw right after he got hurt. Naturally, Mayfield threw a pick. Very different story yesterday on Mayfield’s picks. The Raiders came after him and the Bucs’ offensive line struggled for a few series in the middle of the game, perhaps for the first time in weeks, maybe months. Put any quarterback under steady pressure and he’s going to make mistakes. So to Joe, this is somewhat easily fixable. Mayfield had a three-game spurt in October when he threw seven picks and the Bucs went 1-2. The Bucs blew out New Orleans despite Mayfield throwing three picks. The two losses were the curb-stomping to Baltimore and a one-score painful loss to Atlanta. Now with so much at stake, Mayfield’s picks will be magnified. So if he’s now in a funk like he was back in October, it’s best to find a quicker way to get him right. Injuries Mount The best way for a team to have playoff hopes Pearl Harbored is injuries. And boy, injuries are hitting the Bucs hard now. Bucs fans are holding their breath waiting on tests on Antoine Winfield’s knee. His fellow starting safety Jordan Whitehead is on injured reserve for at least the next three games, and it is uncertain if Whitehead can be ready for the regular season finale at home against the Slimy Saints. The injuries do not stop there. Inside linebacker is a joke. Outside of Lavonte David, the Bucs have practice squad dudes. It still cracks Joe up that this Vi Jones has been with the Bucs since late last year and just now (out of necessity) Bucs coach Todd Bowles has stopped saying Jones isn’t ready to play. Joe doesn’t ever recall hearing of a non-rookie linebacker signed by a team and nearly a year later, the guy is finally deemed ready to play. There were times yesterday when there was no question Jones was still not ready. If David goes down, Joe has a terrible feeling so too will the Bucs go down. That would mean the Bucs would be without their starting safeties and inside linebackers — four starters! — if Winfield can’t recover quickly. That’s not something Joe wants to think about. Rachaad White Turning Into A Tough Runner Yesterday may be a turning point in Rachaad White’s career. Joe used to go nuts when Bucs’ play-callers would run up the middle with White because he was such an ineffective back between the tackles. But has White transformed before our very eyes? He’s even looking like a slightly reliable fullback at times. Yesterday, White was able to fight his way for two or three yards right into the hornet’s nest. Joe was impressed because those were tough running yards to gain. Yet White did it. Those runs took work, guts, hustle and physicality. With his two touchdowns yesterday, one receiving and another running (a career first in one game) White joined select company. San Francisco’s Christian McCaffrey and White are the only two players to have at least 10 rushing and at least 10 receiving touchdowns since the start of the 2022 season. That impresses Joe. Bucs Really Missed Tykee Smith Bucs rookie nickel corner Tykee Smith had missed the past three games with a bum knee. He says he ran into a teammate at practice and bumped knees. Several days after the injury, Todd Bowles said Smith “aggravated” the knee but Bowles was not specific. Yesterday, Smith was given the green light and he made a huge play in the red zone, picking off an Aidan O’Connell pass intended for All-World rookie tight end Brown Bowers late in the third quarter with the Raiders driving to take the lead. Bowles raved about Smith after the game. And Bowles sure sounded as if Smith was just what the doctor ordered, especially with all the injuries to the safeties. Joe suspects if the Bucs make the playoffs, Smith will have made an impact play or two, on top of the ones he already has.|2024-12-09 04:00:00|951|20|7|Five Things|Bucs lead|6|Mixed feelings with some optimism and criticism in fan comments.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Tiff, Okla,Bake, Bucs 4 life"", ""post"": ""Interception by Tykee was a thing of Beauty, way 2 go Tykee"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""9th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""4:38"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""David S Pear"", ""post"": ""Rachaad has always been good.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/bucs-offense-looked-ugly-yesterday-but-was-it-a-mirage/|Bucs Offense Looked Ugly Yesterday, But Was It A Mirage?|Picks. Fumbles. Punts — ugh, the punts! After the Bucs jumped to a 14-0 lead, much of the next 2 1/2 quarters was painful to watch. The non-production was enough to get one nauseous thinking of letting the lowly Raiders stay in the game and nearly take a lead in the third quarter. Thank you, Tykee Smith! But was the production in the second and third quarters really that bad? The offense performing badly in the second and third quarters might be a mirage, per the Bucs’ media relations team. How so? Joe saw the punts, the picks and the fumbles. How was that not bad? Well, the Bucs racked up yardage and moved the ball on the Raiders. They just weren’t finishing very often. The Bucs had 420 net yards of offense. It was the seventh time this season the Bucs reached such a feat. Aside from the Commandos, no other NFL team has had at least 400 net yards seven times. Tampa Bay averages 379.3 yards of offense per game – the third-highest average in the NFL in 2024. So, yeah the Bucs offense may have looked really sluggish, almost like 2013 in the second and third quarters yesterday. But the first and fourth quarters were a different story.|2024-12-09 03:45:00|211|22|3|Bucs Offense|Ugly start but redeeming yardage stats|2|Mixed reactions on team performance with criticism of offensive play calling and Baker's inconsistency.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Leopold Stotch"", ""post"": ""Seemed like a lot of penalties too.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/rachaad-white-had-his-best-day-on-the-ground-in-2024/|Rachaad White Had His Best Day On The Ground (In 2024)|It’s hard to believe, but 2024 will end three weeks from tomorrow. (Dang, it will take Joe three months to get used to typing/writing “2025.” Joe never has these issues when the calendar year is an even number. Only an odd number.) With but four games left in this regular season, the Bucs are perched precariously atop the NFC South. That could be short-lived given who the Bucs and Dixie Chicks play next Sunday. Still, even at this late day, there are players having their best games. Take Bucs running back Rachaad White. Nick Shook of NFL.com has the stats that show White had his best game of 2024 yesterday against the Raiders. White recorded season highs in carries (17) and rushing yards (90). Yesterday also was the first NFL game in which White scored a rushing touchdown and a receiving touchdown. And Joe will add that White leads the team in total touchdowns with 8 — three rushing and five receiving. The Bucs likely will need to lean on White more. With Bucky Irving now nursing a back injury that shelved him for much of yesterday, in addition to his messed up hip, who knows how much he can be used. So White may become the bellcow of the Bucs’ running backs.|2024-12-09 00:15:00|213|8|7|Rachaad White|White shines in best game of 2024 as Bucs face challenges.|6|Optimistic comments about players and future games, with some negative sentiments towards critics.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""OR Buc"", ""post"": ""Yippee"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""9th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""12:23"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""BillyBucco"", ""post"": ""I figured after Arizona St won big, he would have an inspiring game."", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""9th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""12:25"", ""am""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""MadMax"", ""post"": ""Rachaad is being pushed to be his best\u2026and succeeding, i love it.
