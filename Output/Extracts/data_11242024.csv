https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/11/more-postseason-breaks-for-the-buccaneers/|More Postseason Breaks For The Buccaneers|The football gods continue to help the Buccaneers in their quest for another Super Bowl. Look who lost today in the NFC. The 49ers (5-6) got hammered by the Packers (8-3). That’s a good potential happening for the Bucs’ postseason Wild Card chances. While the 49ers hold a head-to-head tiebreaker edge on the Bucs (5-6), San Francisco has a brutal remaining schedule with a trip to Buffalo up next. Washington (7-5) also lost. They were upset at home by depleted Dallas (4-7). The Commanders have been imploding and allowed 24 fourth-quarter points to the Cowboys. The Bucs own a Wild Card head-to-head tiebreaker on Washington. Damn, if the Eagles (8-2) can knock off the Rams (5-5) tonight, the Bucs’ Wild Card chances will have taken a massive step forward this weekend. Of course, the goal is for the Bucs to win the NFC South. Tampa Bay sits one game behind Atlanta (6-5), which owns the head-to-head tiebreaker on the Bucs. However, on paper, Atlanta has tough remaining games on their schedule against the Chargers, Vikings and Commanders. The Bucs, using the same on-paper gauge, have only one rough opponent — at the Chargers on Dec. 15.|2024-11-24 20:21:00|196|25|8|Buccaneers|Buccaneers' playoff chances brighten with recent NFC losses and upcoming games.|5|Mixed sentiments on Bucs' playoff chances; cautious optimism mixed with concerns and doubts.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Xristos"", ""post"": ""Lets see if we can win the Panthers and the Raiders and after we can talk about the Playoff chances we have.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/11/ira-kaufmans-10-takeaways-from-buccaneers-giants/|Ira Kaufman’s 10 Takeaways From Buccaneers-Giants|BY IRA KAUFMAN Look out, Atlanta. With Sunday’s dominant effort at the Meadowlands, the Buccaneers announced their intentions of chasing down the slumping Falcons atop the NFC South. The rest of the schedule appears favorable for Tampa Bay, although the upcoming Panthers are playing some good football. If the Bucs win five of their remaining six games to finish 10-7, the Falcons will need to go at least 4-2 to win the division. Given Atlanta’s shaky play in recent weeks, that looks like a stretch. The Bucs took command early in the swamps of Jersey and made quick work of the 2-9 Giants. The offense and defense took turns squeezing the life out of New York — sending frustrated Giant fans speeding toward the exits. It was a complete performance, snapping a 4-game losing streak and giving the Bucs added confidence they can make a late-season surge for the second consecutive year. Baker Mayfield was virtually flawless, Mike Evans made his presence felt and rookie Bucky Irving was sensational. The offensive line provided sturdy protection and opened up big holes as Tampa Bay rolled up 450 yards. Not to be outdone, a beleaguered defense was not going to suffer a letdown against Tommy DeVito, who was sacked four times and hit on nine occasions. Vita Vea, Calijah Kancey, YaYa Diaby and Anthony Nelson were dynamic up front while the arrival of Mike Edwards seemed to have a calming effect on a secondary that played with more physicality and precision. The Bucs delivered a first-half clinic that left no doubt about the outcome. En route to a 23-0 halftime lead, Tampa Bay owned a 17-3 advantage in first downs and a 290-45 difference in total yards while limiting the Giants to a mere 18 snaps. Eighteen. All this without stud left tackle Tristan Wirfs, who might be ready for Carolina. It may have been one of the best halves of Buccaneer football since the opening 30 minutes of the 2003 Super Bowl against the Raiders. Liam Coen kept New York’s defense off balance while the bye week gave Todd Bowles an opportunity to self-scout his defensive woes. The improvement was startling. DeVito never had a chance as a strong pass rush threw off his rhythm. Bowles timed his blitzes well and New York’s suspect offensive line was overwhelmed. Meanwhile, Mayfield had ample time to survey the field and go through his progressions. On the few occasions protection broke down, Mayfield used his legs and toughness to punish the Giants, highlighted by an acrobatic TD run. The Giants are a lousy team going through the motions, but that doesn’t diminish how well the visitors played on a crisp fall afternoon. You want to quibble? Here’s one: why was Mayfield still in the game late in the fourth quarter, especially after he was dinged up in a collision with Luke Goedeke? That’s right, you really have to nitpick if you’re looking for things that need to be corrected before the Bucs head off to Charlotte. Here’s how the Bucs returned to the winning track with a 30-7 rout that surely grabbed the attention of the 6-5 Falcons: * I pleaded for Irving to receive 18 touches from scrimmage — and 18 touches he was granted. All he did was gain 87 yards on the ground and catch all six passes sent his way for an additional 64 yards. You want big plays? How about a 56-yard run and a 32-yard reception? This kid makes the kind of sharp cuts you can’t teach … and he’s only getting started. Mark him down for 1,000 rushing yards in 2025. On second thought, he may get there this year. * It’s not easy to find a Buccaneer who didn’t play well. Chris Izien led all Tampa Bay defenders with 10 tackles and Zyon McCollum also had a good day. Mayfield probably deserved the game ball, but he had plenty of competition. * Memo to Sean Tucker: Work on those new kickoff rules. * Even with Wirfs sidelined, the Bucs built a secure pocket for Mayfield. He threw 30 passes and wasn’t sacked. Heck, he was hit only twice. Don’t look now, but Goedeke deserves Pro Bowl consideration at right tackle. * Remember when the Bucs had major issues scoring touchdowns in the opening half? Those days are OVER. * We’ll never know for sure, but the return of Evans seemed to open things up for some big plays. The Bucs gained at least 26 yards on six different snaps Sunday while the offensively challenged Giants had only two snaps that went for more than 17 yards. * Even the most ardent Bowles skeptics have to admit the Bucs were geeked to play well coming off the bye. Tampa Bay fans deserved a laugher after a grim month. * Besides his scoring run, Mayfield led the downfield blocking on Irving’s 56-yard burst. His enthusiasm for the game is contagious. He may not have Josh Allen’s arm, but Mayfield plays with the same abandon. He’s the leader of this team, period. * The Giants have scored the fewest points in the league and DeVito gets sacked a lot, but Tampa Bay’s defense played with noticeably more energy and aggression. They’ll have to maintain that attitude the rest of the way to have any chance for a fourth consecutive NFC South title. * The Falcons hear those pewter footsteps rumbling up I-75. Raheem Morris often talks about a “Race to 10” in describing what it will take to make the playoffs. Count the Bucs out at your own peril. |2024-11-24 20:08:00|930|25|8|Ira Kaufman|Buccaneers dominate Giants|5|Mixed sentiments ranging from optimism to criticism.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Buccaneer Bonzai"", ""post"": ""If Mayfield had a slightly more accurate arm, he\u2019d be the second coming of Drew Brees."", ""post_time"": [""November"", ""24th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""8:22"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Canabuc"", ""post"": ""Still feel we turtles a bit in the 2md half rather than keeping foot on the gas.\nWe went away from the quick passing game and started running up the guy not getting much out of it."", ""post_time"": [""November"", ""24th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""8:22"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""OrlandoBucFan"", ""post"": ""Let\u2019s not get ahead of ourselves.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/11/six-games-and-597-yards-to-go-for-mike-evans/|Six Games And 597 Yards To Go For Mike Evans|The legendary Mike Evans streak is still in play. Extending it to 11 years is hanging by a reasonably strong thread. Evans returned to the field today after missing 3 1/2 games with a messed up hamstring. He logged 68 yards in the Bucs’ blowout win and Joe was so happy the Bucs didn’t force the ball to Evans late in garbage time. In fact, Evans was barely on the field with the game out of reach. Smart. So Evans has six games remaining to reach 1,000 receiving yards for the regular season. He needs another 597 yards, basically 100 yards per game. Evans is riding a streak of 10 consecutive years hitting that 1,000-yard mark, and reaching 11 mean he would tie Jerry Rice for the all-time record. Evans wants the record. Bucs fans want it badly. Everyone at One Buc Palace is pulling for Evans. And be damn sure that Baker Mayfield is determined to get Evans the rock. Joe hopes the Bucs put playoffs success first. That’s football. Don’t go crazy for one player’s streak. If the Bucs fall out of the 2024 postseason chase, then Joe is all for pounding the ball into Evans 20 or more times a game to get him to 1,000 yards For now, Joe thinks Evans and the streak are in a good place.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/11/liam-coen-bucco-bruce-arians-ii/|Liam Coen = Bucco Bruce Arians II|As Joe pointed out last week, the Bucs are on the cusp of wasting one of the best offenses in the NFL. Only three teams in the Super Bowl era have averaged as many points as the Bucs have and not made the playoffs. The 2016 slimy Saints and the 2016 Chargers are the other two. Each had a losing record that season. The Bucs, as Joe sees it, must go 5-1 the rest of the way to have a legit shot at a playoff berth. Through 11 games, the Bucs have scored 30 or more points in six. Only the Buffalo Bills this season have more 30-point games. But to fully appreciate the craftmanship that Bucs offensive coordinator Liam Coen has worked on the offense and Baker Mayfield, one only needs to look at the official NFL gamebook of the Bucs’ 30-7 curb-stomping of the Giants today in the New Jersey Swamplands. Mayfield connected with 11 different targets. That’s right, 11! Mayfield threw 30 times, completing 24 passes to 11 different targets. That’s unreal. And Mayfield finished with 294 yards passing. He didn’t throw a touchdown pass but he scored a touchdown by running in from 10 yards out and trolling Giants fans with the Tommy Cutlets eccellente gesture. Completing passes to 11 different receivers and having a punishing ground attack on top of it (the Bucs ran for 156 yards on 32 carries) shows just how diverse Coen’s offense is. Those 11 different receivers were the most the Bucs have had in franchise history. Four other times a Bucs quarterback linked up with 11 different receivers in a game. The last time came in December 2020 when Bucco Bruce Arians and Tom Brady ran the offense. How ’bout that? Damn, Joe’s going to miss Coen. “This Joe” just cannot see how he isn’t a head coach somewhere next year, college or the NFL.|2024-11-24 18:10:00|315|30|4|Liam Coen|Bucs offense shows promise under Coen's guidance.|6|Mixed sentiments regarding potential coaching changes|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""SteveK"", ""post"": ""Hope we win out and beat the Chiefs again for the Lombardi, then I won\u2019t be as bummed to see Coen get a (rightful) head coaching gig.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/11/the-streak-is-over/|The Streak Is Over!|Joe knows a lot of Bucs fans point to different uncomortable elements of Todd Bowles’ style of leading an NFL team. But for Joe, this is just about the worst. Entering today’s beatdown of the Giants in the New Jersey Swamplands, Bowles’ record in games coming off a bye was 1-5, including losing five in a row. The worst of the worst was two years ago in Cleveland when Tom Brady was starting a game-winning drive in the final seconds. Bowles took the ball out of Brady’s hands. Pulled the rug out from under him. Bowles, as he is wont to do, played for overtime and guess what? The Bucs got beat. When you don’t play for the win, you lose. After the game, Bowles said his decision to let the air out of the tires was because Brady could have thrown a pick. This game was in late November and to that point in the 2022 season, Brady had thrown two interceptions. Tom. Freaking. Brady! Well, that streak is over in the wake of the Bucs’ 30-7 beatdown of the Giants today in which the Bucs played just about a perfect first half. “This Joe” was always dubious of the Bucs going 6-1 to finish the season and maybe get a playoff berth. One reason was Bowles’ ugly streak of losses coming off a bye. So this is one big win down and five more wins to go. Can a Bowles’ led team actually finish a season 6-1?

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/11/jason-licht-offensive-line-is-among-the-very-best/|Jason Licht: Offensive Line Is Among The Very Best|So Buccaneers Ring of Honor general manager Jason Licht was pounding his chest before today’s game, metaphorically speaking. No Tristan Wirfs available for Sunday’s blowout win against the Giants’ stout defensive front, but Licht had no problem telling the world his offensive line is among the very best in the NFL. Speaking on the Buccaneers Radio Network before kickoff, Licht made the proclamation and emphasized that Wirfs’ backup, Justin Skule, is a significantly better left tackle than right tackle and would be more than capable today. Skule lived up to Licht’s billing, as did the rest of the O-line. The Giants sack-happy defense, second-most in the NFL before today’s game, only hit Baker Mayfield twice and did not record a sack. Scoreboard! Licht also said starting left guard Ben Bredeson, his free agent pick-up, was playing strong ball and would come out extra feisty today playing against his former team. Correct, Mr. Licht. Joe’s got all the love in the world for Licht’s work building the Tampa Bay offensive line. Anyone hear from Pro Bowl Giants nose tackle Dexter Lawrence today? Winning in December and January is often all about offensive line play. Joe looks forward to watching it play out.|2024-11-24 17:34:00|201|14|8|Jason Licht|Licht praises Buccaneers' offensive line as one of NFL's best|6|Mix of optimistic and pessimistic comments about the team's performance and coaching decisions.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""DavidBigBucsFan99"", ""post"": ""Sometimes that\u2019s the only thing he can draft well"", ""post_time"": [""November"", ""24th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""5:37"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Zzbucs"", ""post"": ""What about the coaching staff??"", ""post_time"": [""November"", ""24th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""5:41"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""Capt.Tim"", ""post"": ""We have the best pair of tackles in the NFL.\nBarton is learning on the job, but will soon be an elite Center.\nMauch was bad last year, bad at the beginning of this year.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/11/more-fireworks-from-bucky-irving/|More Fireworks From Bucky Irving|Another special, special day from the best rookie running back in the National Football League. This time, Bucky Irving made his mark catching and taking handoffs. Irving wasn’t find holes and making guys miss early on running plays, but that changed late against the Giants when Irving exploded for a 56-yard run. He finished with 12 carries for 87 yards. As a receiving back is where Irving was featured in the first half. Rachaad White had no first-half catches but Irving caught all six balls thrown his way for 64 yards, including a 32-yarder that will make all kinds of NFL highlights shows tonight. Irving has now caught a whopping 32 of 34 balls thrown his way this season, an incredible percentage that may be the best in the NFL after this weekend’s games. On those 32 catches, Irving is averaging 7.87 yards per catch. Every week Irving is more and more impressive. It’s said that teams need a stout running game to succeed in the postseason. The Bucs may not have a playoff defense, but they certainly have a playoff-caliber back.|2024-11-24 17:23:00|182|25|8|Bucky Irving|Impressive performance by rookie running back Bucky Irving in NFL.|6|Mixed feelings: praise for certain players|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Steven #55"", ""post"": ""RB1"", ""post_time"": [""November"", ""24th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""5:28"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Tampabaybucfan"", ""post"": ""Fantastic\u2026we have 3 really good backs and all are healthy\u2026"", ""post_time"": [""November"", ""24th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""5:31"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""Danfan"", ""post"": ""Very quickly making RW redundant.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/11/calijah-kancey-showing-why-he-was-a-high-draft-pick/|Calijah Kancey Showing Why He Was A High Draft Pick|One guy jumped off the screen at Joe today. And that would be defensive tackle Calijah Kancey. Kancey is known for his speed getting to quarterbacks. And goodness gracious he looked shot out of a cannon today chasing Giants quarterback Tommy Cutlets. Kancey had a monster sack of Cutlets early and in the second half on a ferocious hit on Cutlets, it was as if a young Warren Sapp himself bolted past the Giants’ offensive line to splash the backup Giants signal-caller. Later in the second half, Kancey exploded off the line and Joe thought he broke Cutlets in half in the end zone. Kancey didn’t get the sack but Cutlets will remember that hit for a while. Cutlets couldn’t get up right away and he had to leave the game just for a play as dummy Drew Lock came in. Kancey is now on a four-game sack streak. So yeah, after returning from a calf injury to get a late start to the season, Kancey a few weeks ago told Joe he was just getting in regular-season shape as his first couple of games were in essence his training camp. The way Kancey is playing, he looks to be in fine form. And the Bucs need him to keep up his dangerous play.|2024-11-24 16:01:00|214|44|9|Calijah Kancey|Stellar performance by Calijah Kancey in recent games.|5|Mixed sentiments: varying from pessimistic comments to optimistic remarks about players and games.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Ds"", ""post"": ""Kancey is nasty !"", ""post_time"": [""November"", ""24th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""4:05"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Rod Munch"", ""post"": ""Said it in the game day thread, but Kancey\u2019s 17-game pace works out to a 14 sack season."", ""post_time"": [""November"", ""24th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""4:05"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""BucsFan81"", ""post"": ""Kitty cats trying to beat the chiefs."", ""post_time"": [""November"", ""24th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""4:08"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter3"": {""username"": ""DBS"", ""post"": ""Really?

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/11/baker-mayfield-was-on-fire/|Baker Mayfield Was On Fire|How could anyone not suggest Baker Mayfield is one of the better quarterbacks in the league the way he played today? Mayfield was Midas today. Everything he touched turned to gold. Need a first down? Mayfield threw and ran for them. Need a touchdown? Mayfield threw and ran for them. Need blocking? Mayfield was 50 yards downfield blocking for Bucky Irving! Need vaudeville? After Mayfield ran for a 10-yeard touchdown in the second quarter, Mayfield jumped up and answered the jeering Jersey residents with his own version of the Tommy Cutlets’ eccellente sign, which enraged the ziti-eating Giants crowd. Indirectly, Mayfield almost sparked a melee along the sidelines when he was shoved out of bounds late (no flag) and Bucs offensive linemen raced in to raise Cain and protect their quarterback. Remember how folks laughed and mocked and snickered like Mutley at the Bucs for signing Mayfield? The Kyle Trask cultists were knee-sLapping laughing. Well, who is laughing now (besides AC/DC-loving general manager Jason Licht and coach Todd Bowles)? Surely not the folks that have to defend against Mayfield. Mayfield was dominant today.

Bucs head coach Todd Bowles did an interview with the CBS sideline reporter and noted that his team needed to close out strong against the Giants after taking a 23-0 lead after 30 minutes. “We let our foot off the gas the first half of the season,” Bowles said. What? Joe doesn’t recall hearing Bowles say anything close to that previously. Joe found it to be a telling remark. Was Bowles talking about coaches, playcalls, players letting up? Regardless, the Bucs were strong today, winning 30-7. The Giants came out with a solid drive in the third quarter, but Lavonte David forced a fumble in the red zone, which snuffed out any life the Giants may have had. The Bucs answered with a 12-play, 95-yard drive. But overall it was ugly after that for the Bucs.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/11/buccaneers-30-giants-7-200-remaining/|Buccaneers 30, Giants 7|It’s a blowout! Joe is fired up. Today the Bucs did what good teams do. They crushed a weaker opponent.  The Giants put up no resistance and the Bucs came out sharp, scoring on the opening possession and jumping out to a 23-0 halftime lead. Mike Evans looked fresh and had 4 catches for 53 yards in the first half in his return from a significant hamstring injury. He finished with 5 catches for 68 yards. In the opening 30 minutes, Evans was surpassed by only Bucky Irving, whose 6 catches on 6 targets for 64 yards led the way. Obviously, the Giants (2-9) stink and were rolling with a third-string quarterback, but Joe has to give the Bucs defense credit. The blitzes got home. Vita Vea was a menace on mutliple occasions. There were big stops in the run defense and the defense had a huge hand in putting the game away before halftime. Did having Zyon McCollum and Jamel Dean starting together again help? It sure didn’t hurt. Joe hopes each guy came out healthy and ready for the stretch run. Baker Mayfield was sharp and delivered a sweet display of hustle to block downfield for Bucky Irving on his huge 56-yard run in the fourth quarter (video below). Our beloved Bucs are now 5-6, one game behind the Falcons. Hope has been restored. .@BakerMayfield as the lead blocker for @BuckyIrving 😤|2024-11-24 15:43:00|234|38|9|Buccaneers|Buccaneers dominate Giants with strong defense and offensive firepower.|3|Mixed reactions to Mayfield staying in game.

Joining Wirfs on the bench are nickel cornerback Tykee Smith (knee), undrafted rookie cornerback Tyrek Funderburk, in addition to bottom-of-the-roster guys Jose Ramirez, Earnest Brown and Devin Culp. Zyon McCollum (hamstring) is active. How much he might play is another story. If he’s ready to roll, then the Bucs will have their starting outside cornerbacks, McCollum and Jamel Dean, on the field together for the first time in more than a month.|2024-11-24 11:54:00|99|2|2|Tristan Wirfs|Injuries affecting key players in upcoming game.|3|7|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Drunk Bucs Fan"", ""post"": ""Unfortunate but wise"", ""post_time"": [""November"", ""24th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""12:06"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""MadMax"", ""post"": ""Good, let him heal, Evans too, only a little here and there"", ""post_time"": [""November"", ""24th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""12:20"", ""pm""]}}"

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/11/betting-the-bucs-week-12-edition/|Betting The Bucs (Week 12 Edition)|Have you ever been rattled to your core? That happened to Joe a month ago.  On these pages, for the Week 7 edition of “Betting The Bucs,” Joe picked three losers, an 0-for-3 night. That doesn’t happen to Joe and it called for a mental, spiritual and film-study reset. Call it a midseason training camp for Bucs wagering. That’s now complete. So Joe is returning today with a 6-8 record on the Bucs season and a look into where Joe is throwing cash in today’s game against the Giants in New Jersey. (Sports betting is legal in Florida but there’s only one government-regulated Florida sportsbook monopoly run by the Seminole tribe. That’s where Joe gets the betting lines.) Bucky Irving Over 39.5 yards (-275) – The Giants have the NFL’s worst run defense and Irving has 40 or more yards in 7 of 10 games this season. Obviously, the betting odds here aren’t good. A $30 bet returns $41, but Joe will be happy to take a “W” and a Pollo Tropical lunch. Irving (5.1 yards-per-carry average) should get at least 10 carries no matter how much the Bucs try to get Sean Tucker involved. Also, Joe will note Irving was full-go in practice all through last week. In prior practice weeks, the team was resting his sketchy toe. Buccaneers, First Team To Score (-165) – Defense is the strength of the Giants and for the Bucs, obviously, it’s their offense. So Joe is confident that if the Giants win the coin toss, they’ll defer to the Bucs. And if the Bucs win the toss, then Joe suspects they’ll take the football. Throw in the Giants have a ton of trouble scoring and the Bucs are good on opening drives — and Bucs kicker Chase McLaughlin is money and Giants kicker Greg Joseph isn’t — so Joe feels like this is worth a little cash. Jalen McMillan — Under 1.5 receptions (+140) – With Mike Evans returning and Baker Mayfield buddy Sterling Shepard returning to face his former team, Joe’s not feeling a lot of targets coming to McMillan. He may not even get a lot of snaps as the Bucs hope to punish the Giants on the ground. McMillan hasn’t played since Week 6. And Joe still remembers Mayfield’s harsh comment about McMillan 2 1/2 weeks ago.|2024-11-24 10:26:00|388|4|3|Joe|Joe analyzes Bucs game with betting picks.|6|Mixed feelings towards sports betting success and uncertainty|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""MadMax"", ""post"": ""I made almost 3k last year, lost about 500 of it (i save all tickets) so +2500.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/11/a-2015-flashback-game-for-mike-evans/|A 2015 Flashback Game For Mike Evans|So once upon a time in Week 2 of the 2015 season, Mike Evans returned from a long hamstring absence like he will today. Joe remembers the game (heck, Joe remembers every game). Evans made his season debut against the hated Saints and did not catch a pass on only three targets. Essentially, Evans was mostly there to draw attention and block. A week later, Evans had a whopping 17 targets come his way; he caught only 7 for 101 yards, but that was during the stretch when Evans was dropping footballs, Joe was calling him K-Y hands and fans were questioning whether Evans’ hamstring was truly healthy. That brings Joe to today when Evans will be on the field but not at 100 percent. That’s a medical assessment Joe’s making because Bucs coaches and an anonymous ESPN report claim Evans will have significant limitations today on the field. Plus, Evans did not say he is 100 percent when talking to media on Friday. So Joe expects a replay of sorts of Evans’ Week 2 showing against New Orleans in 2015. And frankly, the Joe typing here doesn’t get why Evans is even on the field toady. He’s not right and he’s needed for the long haul. Yeah, one could argue there is no “long haul” without a win today against the Giants, but one also could say if the Bucs can’t beat the sad, sad Giants without Evans, then they have no business playing in the postseason. Stay safe, Mike!|2024-11-24 09:27:00|251|12|2|Mike Evans|Evans may struggle due to injury; team under pressure to win.|2|Mixed opinions on playing Evans with concerns on his injury and impact on team performance.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Buchen61"", ""post"": ""\u201cAnd frankly, the Joe typing here doesn\u2019t get why Evans is even on the field toady.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/11/rachaad-white-reveals-secret-about-baker-mayfield-stiff-arm-play-on-nick-bosa/|Rachaad White Reveals Secret About Baker Mayfield Stiff-Arm Play On Nick Bosa|"One could say running back Rachaad White gave the Bucs a chance to win two weeks ago against the 49ers. You remember the play: Fourth down. Bucs’ final drive of regulation. Baker Mayfield is flushed out of the pocket by Nick Bosa. Mayfield runs right and Bosa is all over him like stink on Devin White. Mayfield desperately stiff-arms Bosa and keeps running right. He’s not going to get away from Bosa so Mayfield somehow has to find a receiver and complete a pass or the game is over. Mayfield throws down the right sideline and out of nowhere, White skies like Dwight Clark in triple coverage to come down with the ball. First down Bucs. Move the chains. A lot, and Joe means a lot, of the attention was on how Mayfield held off Bosa just long enough to throw the ball toward White. Tom Brady, who was calling the game for FOX, said it was one of the best moves by a quarterback he’s ever seen. And yes, Mayfield deserved all the accolades. But Joe thought White’s catch was way overlooked. It was a tremendous catch in heavy traffic. So last week Joe finally got a chance to talk to White about that play. He gave Mayfield his props. “It was a great play that Bake made,” White said. “Obviously holding off Bosa with one arm as he’s headed toward the sideline. “It just goes to show our team [doesn’t bail]. He gave me the opportunity to make a play.” The crazy thing is White skied high in the middle of triple coverage. And the great Fred Warner was about to light up White’s world and White knew it was coming. “There were a lot of guys around,” White smiled. But then White let Joe in on a secret. The pass White caught was not intended for him. Mayfield was trying to get the ball to Sterling Shepard who was just behind White, though White didn’t know it and didn’t see Shepard. “He was right behind me,” White said. “I was just running around like scrambling, trying to give [Mayfield] a chance. “I thought the ball was coming to me. But when we sat back and talked about it, I saw ‘Shep’ behind me. I went up to Shep and said, ‘I apologize.'” Really, there was no need for White to apologize. The replay shows Shepard right behind White. Shepard broke for the pass but 49ers corner Deommodore Lenoir was with him. Had White not been able to get a hand on the ball, it sure looks like Lenoir would have picked that pass. He was in perfect position. “I was just trying to make a play, too,” White said. “We were just playing ball [at that moment]. That’s right. That’s how it is man. Like backyard football.” And it was a good thing White has hops or the Bucs likely wouldn’t have had a chance to tie the game.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/11/justin-skule-is-battle-tested/|Justin Skule Is Battle-Tested|When Justin Skule got rag-dolled badly and repeatedly by Aidan Hutchinson in Detroit in Week 2, Bucs fans were chugging bottles of liquor. Every game that starting right tackle Luke Goedeke missed with a nasty concussion, Bucs fans bought more and more bottles of TUMS. Funny thing happened along the way. Skule started getting better. In fact, the Bucs won three of the four games that Skule started with Goedeke sidelined. Two weeks ago when Skule was pressed into service after Tristan Wirfs went down with a knee injury in the second quarter of the loss to the 49ers, Skule held his own with 49ers star pass rusher Nick Bosa. Joe is not about to say Skule owned Bosa. But you know what? Bosa didn’t go bananas on Skule the way Hutchinson did. Bucs offensive coordinator Liam Coen sure took notice. “You do see Skule having more and more confidence as we go and he had to jump in there [against San Francisco]. Go out and go play and you go let it rip and we’ve won games with him obviously in there, we’ve played some good football with him in there. “He’s a smart football player who understands leverage and how to use his hands and how to be able to use his athletic ability to his advantage. That’s just something we’re going to have to go throughout the game and see how it goes.” Joe spoke with Skule last week and he admitted being baptized by fire facing two of the best pass rushers in the game will help him prepare for today — facing Brian Burns and Kayvon Thibodeaux, the menacing Giants edge rushers. In fact, facing tough defensive ends is life in the NFL, Skule told Joe. “Nick Bosa is one of the best in the league and I think Brian Burns and Kavon Thibodeaux are phenomenal defensive ends,” Skule said. “No matter who you are playing, you have to get ready mentally and physically.” Joe agrees with Coen. You could feel Skule’s confidence grow since that awful outing in Detroit. Skule is no longer a liability. No, Skule isn’t Wirfs and never will be.

If you don’t think the starter is any good, imagine how the third-string quarterback is.

Diaby told Joe if a man is in the league, he has skills and the Bucs better respect him. In general terms, Joe asked Diaby about facing a backup who has far less snaps than the previous starter. Diaby said a guy with less experience may make a mistake as a result. And if Tommy Cutlets makes a mistake, the Bucs have to pounce.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/11/tommy-devito-may-be-walking-into-a-buzzsaw/|Tommy Devito May Be Walking Into A Buzzsaw|Someone on Twitter yesterday tried to give Joe a what’s-for when it comes to the Bucs-Giants game this afternoon. Joe pointed out how Chief Illniwek himself, Tommy Cutlets, was a lousy quarterback. This apparently rubbed some folks the wrong way. Can you imagine? Really? We’re talking about a guy the Giants thought so much of they traded for dummy Drew Lock to backup Danny Dimes? Spare Joe! In fact, unless Tommy Cutlets has greatly improved, he is downright horrible when there’s a pass rush. In fact, Tommy Cutlets is brutal beyond words when opposing defenses blitz. And guess what Bucs coach Todd Bowles likes to do? Handicapper turned stathead Warren Sharp has all the cold hard facts about Tommy Cutlets on his site, Sharp Football Analysis. When pressured, [Tommy Cutlets] averaged 4.1 Y/A (42nd) with a sack on a league-high 44.6% of those dropbacks. The Bucs are 8th in blitz rate (30.4%). The way Bowles likes to blitz, this could be a very, very, very long afternoon in the New Jersey Swamplands for Tommy Cutlets. In fact, Joe wonders if we may even see that clown Lock?

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/11/bspn-mike-evans-on-a-pitch-count/|BSPN: Mike Evans On A Pitch Count|Joe doesn’t know who typed the following. But it is very interesting. Last week Bucs offensive coordinator Liam Coen noted he had to be “smart” using Mike Evans and that he really doesn’t know how close he is to 100 percent so Coen is not sure how Evans will be used. In fact, Coen added it wouldn’t be very wise to start sending Evans on go-routes. So an unknown typist for BSPN shared insight how the Bucs are going to use Evans today at the New Jersey Swamplands. It seems Evans will be on the field in critical situations but other than that, he may be on a pitch count in his first game back since blowing out his hamstring against Baltimore four games ago. The Buccaneers hope to get receiver Mike Evans a healthy workload Sunday but will also monitor snaps in his return from a hamstring injury. He will be out there on crucial downs, but Tampa Bay will be smart with him, too, depending on how he feels during the flow of the game. The Bucs had reduced Evans’ snaps even before the injury, as a way to keep the 31-year-old fresh. They can’t afford to lose him for multiple weeks again with a reaggravation, so hamstring fatigue will be considered. Yes, like Todd Bowles said last week, the Bucs need Evans for the long haul. The Bucs painted themselves into a corner with lousy defensive play and being as unclutch as a defense can be. Half of the Bucs’ six losses have come on the final drive of the game. Shameful. Each of the remaining seven games is crucial. The Bucs may be able to lose one. Two, and the playoffs might be a distant, unreachable dream.|2024-11-24 00:01:00|291|7|6|Mike Evans|Evans on pitch count returning from hamstring injury.|6|Mixed opinions on player decisions and team performance|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Dave Pear"", ""post"": ""It might matter if Mike was playing defense.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/11/gameday-tampa-bay-312/|Gameday Tampa Bay| Game 11 Bucs (4-6) at Giants (2-8)  Kickoff: 1 p.m. TV: CBS (WTSP-TV Channel 10, locally) with Andrew Catalon, Tiki Barber, Jason McCourty and AJ Ross.  Streaming: NFL+, Paramount+. (Geographic restrictions apply; subscription may be required). Radio: Buccaneers Radio Network WXTB-FM 97.9 in the Tampa-St. Petersburg region (Transmisiones de radio en español en WTMP-FM 96.1 y WMGG-AM 1470 en Tampa). Additional stations throughout Florida on the Buccaneers Radio Network can be found here. The game also will be broadcast on SiriusXM Channel 386 (Buccaneers Radio Network feed). Weather: Bundle up and get that grill fired up for extra warmth. It’s going to be chilly in the New Jersey Swamplands, per AccuWeather.com. For tailgaters, look for the temps to be in the upper 40s. By kickoff, the temperature should be 54, not too bad. That should remain steady throughout the game. It will be partly sunny this morning but by kickoff some clouds will roll in. Though the Swamplands is known for being windy, it appears there will be only mild winds not exceeding 10 mph. Odds: Per BetMGM, as of midnight, Bucs -6 (-275); over/under 41. Referees: If point spreads are any indication, the Bucs-Giants game today will be tight. That’s the history that referee Adrian Hill and his outfit have as they will work today’s game. Per Sharp Football Analysis, home teams in games called by Hill’s gang is 43-39. Additionally, most games Hill’s posse works also hit the under more often than not. So with an over/under of 41, that suggests today’s game will be low-scoring. Injuries: Bucs — Doubtful: DB Tykee Smith (knee), CB Jamel Dean (hamstring), WR Mike Evans (hamstring), NT Greg Gaines (foot), CB Troy Hill (ankle/foot), CB Zyon McCollum (hamstring), LT Tristan Wirfs (knee). Giants — Questionable: WR Bryce Ford-Wheaton (Achilles), LB Micah McFadden (heel), LB Darius Muasau (hamstring), WR Malik Nabers (groin), LB Kayvon Thibodeaux (wrist). Outlook: It’s real simple: The Bucs cannot fart around any longer. The Bucs have painted themselves into a corner with the mostly lousy play of its defense in the past four games. In half of the Bucs’ six losses, the game was lost on the final drive. That’s terrible for a defense with good talent led by a defensive-minded coach. So it’s do or die. The Bucs likely cannot afford two losses in the final seven games. What has Joe worried is Todd Bowles’ terrible 1-5 record in games following the bye, including five straight losses. The Bucs, of course, had last weekend off with the bye. Given the fact the Bucs will face Chief Illiniwek himself, Tommy Cutlets, who in the past has absolutely melted under the blitz, losing today’s game would be an out-and-out disgrace. There is no way around it: The Bucs must win. If the Bucs drop a game to this sad sack tanking team with a third-string quarterback starting and a full two weeks to prepare, that might be enough to fire up the Coach Watch machine for the 2025 season. Fun facts: It seems Bucs QB Baker Mayfield has been a road warrior since he first signed with the Bucs. In his 27 regular season games in Tampa Bay, Mayfield, in 13 road starts with the Bucs, has accounted 30 touchdowns (28 passing touchdowns) against seven picks. That’s the most touchdowns on the road by an NFL quarterback for the same timeframe. …  RB Rachaad White is one of only four running backs who have over 120 catches since the start of the 2022 season. White is also looking for his fifth game in a row with a touchdown. … DT Vita Vea aims for his fourth consecutive road game with a sack. … DT Calijah Kancey already has a career-high four sacks in a season. In the five games he has played this season, he has seven tackles for loss. … Giants QB Tommy Devito gets his first start of the season. In his past nine games, Devito has eight touchdown passes and two picks. … RB Tyrone Tracy leads all rookie running backs with three games of 100 yards rushing or more. … DL Dexter Lawrence has four sacks in five games at the New Jersey Swamplands. … S Tyler Nubin had a career-high 12 tackles in the Giants’ last game, a 20-17 loss to the Stinking Panthers. He leads all rookies with 69 tackles. Enjoy the Ira Kaufman Podcast.
