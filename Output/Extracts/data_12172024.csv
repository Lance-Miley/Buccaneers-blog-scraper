https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/falcons-bench-kirk-cousins/|Falcons Bench Kirk Cousins|What a wonderful day it is to dislike the Falcons.  While Atlanta beat a terrible Raiders team last night 15-9, it seems their organization didn’t treat the victory with the common NFL attitude, “Any road win in the NFL is a thing of beauty.” Instead, Falcons management saw their mess of an offense and pulled the plug on their $50 million quarterback. Perhaps you’ve heard of him; he’s savior Kirk Cousins, the darling of the national media from March through October. Now Cousiins out in favor of rookie Michael Penix, who will make his debut against the sad Giants before heading to Washington in what will be a massive test on Sunday Night Football. It’s desperation time for Atlanta (7-7), which sits one game behind the Bucs (8-6) with three games to play. Atlanta is in true must-win territory. Joe loves the move to Penix. First, it will be fun to watch. Second, the odds of a rookie jumping into the fray in late December and winning three straight are very slim. Third, Joe is enjoying watching the entire Falcons organzation, from former Bucs head coach Raheem Morris to owner Arthur “don’t call me Irv” Blank, squirm and struggle to keep pace with Tampa Bay.|2024-12-17 21:39:00|205|52|2|Kirk Cousins|Falcons bench Cousins|2|Mixed sentiments towards Kirk Cousins and Penix, criticism of Falcons' decisions.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Rod Munch"", ""post"": ""I don\u2019t really see how their offense could look much worse than it did last night \u2013 that was an all-time awful game to watch.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/mental-giant-lavonte-david/|Mental Giant Lavonte David|It’s obvious that the Buccaneers’ defensive MVP through 14 games is iconic linebacker Lavonte David, but the depth of his contribution is not obvious. David’s consistency and durability is stunning. And then throw in 5 1/2 sacks and 3 forced fumbles. (Joe’s not counting the interception because the Bucs would have been better off without it.) But overlooked is David’s on-field ability to command a complex defense with a constantly-changing roster due to a rash injuries and new signings. Consider what Todd Bowles said after David recorded his best tackling day on Sunday, which included 1 1/2 sacks and a season-high 12 combined tackles (8 solo). “The game he had physically does not even outweigh the game he had mentally,” Bowles said of David on the Buccaneers Radio Network. “… He did an oustanding job with all the different personnel groupings and people coming in the ball game of executing the calls and carrying out the plays and making a ton of plays himself, and getting back in the backfield making sacks — making a ton of tackles and keeping everybody on the straight and narrow.” Complete player.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/that-is-a-testament-to-the-coaching-staff/|“That Is A Testament To The Coaching Staff”|Liam Coen and his offensive staff are starting to get love on the national hollering shows. And Joe believes those props for the Bucs’ first-year offensive coordinator and his assistants are absolutely earned. Coen’s exploits are even getting shout outs from the other side of the ball in the Bucs’ locker room. After the game Joe was talking with Lavonte David and he was very, very impressed with how the offense took care of business, giving the Bucs defense a cushion to work with while racking up 40 points on the NFL’s previously best-scoring defense. Prior to Sunday’s game in Los Angeles, the Chargers were allowing an average of 16 points a game. Scoring 40 points destroyed that average. “Forty points? Huge, huge!” David said. “That is a testament to the coaching staff who came up with a great gameplan.” It wasn’t just the gameplan but the minute details. The precise blocking set up the Chargers defense to focus so much on Mike Evans that it allowed Jalen McMillan to sneak past the defense. How good has the offensive coaching been? Well, the running game speaks for itself. But look at Baker Mayfield. He was hailed for having a career year last year. This year, he’s on pace to put up more career-high numbers. Mayfield currently has 3,617 yards passing. Last year he set a personal high-water mark with 4,044 yards passing. Mayfield only needs to average 142 yards a game to top that. Mayfield has already thrown for 32 touchdowns, a career-high. And his current completion percentage of 70.8 percent is a career-high. The Bucs are humming and a lot of credit goes to Coen and his assistants.|2024-12-17 16:06:00|279|17|8|Liam Coen|Bucs' coaching staff praised for offensive success.|5|Mixed sentiment on offense, coordinators, and team performance, highlighting some concerns and positive aspects.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""BucsBeast"", ""post"": ""Coen needs to be kept at all cost.

Mike Evans is back, baby! However, Evans made it sound Sunday like he’s not firing full throttle yet but he’s damn close. “You know, I’m finally starting to feel like myself again,” Evans told the Buccaneers Radio Network in the happy Bucs locker room. “Had that time off, getting back in the swing of things and I’m feeling pretty good.” And that’s damn exciting for Joe. While Buccaneers Ring of Honor general manager Jason Licht said Mike Evans was “100 percent” weeks ago and Todd Bowles said Evans had a green light on the field, Joe wasn’t buying that Evans’ was his best self. So it seems the best of 2024 Mike Evans is yet to come.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/bucs-hype-soars/|Bucs Hype Soars|It’s so much fun to hear national media types throw love at the Bucs. Especially now, after an offseason full of Kirk Cousins nonsense. Joe greatly looks forward to the Falcons missing the playoffs for the seventh consecutive season. What a fun day that will be. One man firmly in the Bucs’ corner on a national stage is Mike Florio, the NBC super insider and the guru at ProFootballTalk.com, and a friend of Joe. Preseason, Florio picked the Bucs to reach the NFC Championship game. And in new power rankings, he’s got the Bucs ranked as the best 8-6 team in the NFL. 9. Broncos (No. 9; 9-5): Bo Nix had a bad day, and they still won by 23. 10. Commanders (No. 10; 9-5): They managed to get some breathing room for the No. 7 seed. Barely. 11. Buccaneers (No. 13; 8-6): They’re peaking again, at the perfect time. 12. Texans (No. 14; 9-5): With the Chiefs and Ravens coming up, we’ll find out if they’re ready to win games they’re supposed to lose. 13. Rams (No. 15; 8-6): They can beat anyone in the NFC playoff field. Which means everyone in the NFC playoff field should hope they don’t get in. The Bucs sure are peaking. That win against the Chargers was a massive step forward on both sides of the ball, especially on defense. Joe’s not going to bark about the Commanders getting a higher ranking than the Bucs. Joe’s feeling the Commanders love in expectation of them hammering the Falcons in two weeks and clinching another NFC South title for the Bucs with one game to play.|2024-12-17 12:48:00|271|42|8|Bucs Hype Soars|National media hype for Buccaneers playoff potential.|4|Mixed sentiments with cautious optimism and doubt about playoff scenarios and upcoming games.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""dls5492"", ""post"": ""I also enjoy celebrating Atalanta Falcons\u2019 Day on March 28!"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""17th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""12:51"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""adam from ny"", ""post"": ""yep\u2026people are now starting to jock the bucs\u2026"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""17th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""12:54"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""SlyPirate"", ""post"": ""I\u2019m conflicted.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/thats-a-perfectly-executed-play/|“That’s A Perfectly Executed Play!”|There was so much to like about the Bucs’ beatdown of the Chargers that Joe still doesn’t know where to begin. A lot of Bucs fans will point to Mike Evans having a monster day. Others will revel in Baker Mayfield throwing four touchdowns. Some Bucs fans will point to Lavonte David having a ho-hum Lavonte David game: dominant all over the field. Still others will laugh hysterically out loud remembering Bucky Irving’s 54-yard run. When Joe arrived at SoFi Stadium and headed to his seat, Joe saw good guy Brian Baldinger in the press box maybe 10 yards away. Joe said hi but Baldinger didnt’t hear Joe. But Joe knew there was going to be good Bucs content coming if Baldy was there. The former NFL offensive lineman was geeked about the Bucs play, too. Only for Baldginer, he focused on the Bucs’ offensive line. Baldy broke down the blocking that took place on Irving’s 54-yard run, the longest run against Chargers have given up all year. Ben Bredeson, Ko Kieft and Ryan Miller (!) were the key men who helped pop Irving free. “That’s a perfectly executed play!” Baldinger said. It’s pretty cool, that’s for sure.|2024-12-17 12:04:00|198|21|7|The Bucs|Bucs beat Chargers with impressive plays and teamwork.|7|Overall positive sentiment with praise for team performance and individual player contributions.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""JBBUCS_06"", ""post"": ""Beautiful"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""17th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""12:44"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""adam from ny"", ""post"": ""go bucky go\u2026!"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""17th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""12:47"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""adam from ny"", ""post"": ""that video was a thing of beauty\u2026"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""17th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""12:48"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter3"": {""username"": ""SlyPirate"", ""post"": ""Awesome analysis.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/falcons-limp-to-7-7-record/|Falcons Limp To 7-7 Record|If you like lots of punts, blocked punts and poor quarterback play, last night’s Raiders-Falcons game was your Super Bowl.  Joe was locked on every snap because the Faclons entered the game 1 1/2 games behind Tampa Bay (8-6) in the standings. Now, the Falcons (7-7) are just one game back after beating the Raiders 15-9. Kirk Cousins dazzled en route to 93 yards passing for Atlanta and an interception, and he showcased his mobility on an extra day’s rest. Man, it was ugly. The two-win Raiders were bad in all phases of the game, truly, and even let the impotent Atlanta pass rush rack up four sacks. Dismal Desmond Ridder had some flashes, but that was about it for the Raiders home crowd to cheer about. So Atlanta now has games remaining against the Giants at home, the Commanders on the road and their season finale at home against the Panthers. Joe would love to see the Bucs clinch early and enter Week 18 with a meanlingless home game against the slimy Saints. That’s unlikely, however, especially if the Bucs are still battling for the No. 3 playoff season in the NFC, which they hold right now.|2024-12-17 08:45:00|198|40|3|Falcons|Falcons barely win in ugly game against Raiders.|3|There is a mix of frustration over past games and caution towards the upcoming matchups.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Cobraboy"", ""post"": ""That Raiders team is truly stinky.

Oh, Joe loves Ja’Marr Chase and over in the corner Justin Jefferson is waving his hand. But then there is the greatest offensive player in Buccaneers history, Mike Evans. And NextGen Stats suggests that only Cheetah Hill is better than Evans — at least more productive when it comes to deep balls. NextGen Stats points out that since 2016, only Cheetah has caught more touchdowns off deep balls than Evans. Cheetah has 42. Evans has 34 after catching two yesterday. The fact that Evans did this against a Chargers defense that before yesterday only gave up an average of 15.9 points is pretty damn impressive. And that’s exactly what Evans is: impressive. https://twitter.com/NextGenStats/status/1868444599079076138|2024-12-17 07:00:00|140|25|9|Mike Evans|Mike Evans impresses with deep ball catching skills.|6|Mixed sentiment towards Mike Evans, leaning more towards optimism with some negativity.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Hail2dabucs"", ""post"": ""He is him He is impressive He is himpressive !"", ""post_time"": [""Hail2dabucs""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Permanently Moderated"", ""post"": ""Get him that 1000 yards!"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""17th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""7:17"", ""am""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""Allen Lofton"", ""post"": ""The Bucs are not a big Metropolitan area.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/winner-liam-coen/|Winner: Liam Coen|Long-time NFL.com columnist Jeffri Chadiha decided to cobble together a winners and losers list for this past weekend’s games. And with the Bucs, the man Chadiha thinks is the biggest winner is offensive coordinator Liam Coen. Coen, Chadiha says, should be on teams’ radars that are hunting for a new head coach. And Coen may have made a monster statement, all but hollering on national TV, “Hire me!” with a gameplan that racked up 40 points on the NFL’s top-scoring defense. Prior to getting curb-stomped by the Bucs, the Chargers were only allowing an average of 16 points a game. That performance Sunday may have lifted Coen’s visibility among NFL owners, Chadiha types. Liam Coen: The Buccaneers have the best offense that nobody ever talks about, and that’s largely because of Coen’s leadership as coordinator. … The Bucs beat the Chargers with the pass (Baker Mayfield threw for four touchdowns, while Mike Evans accounted for 159 yards and two scores) and the run (223 yards on the ground, led by Bucky Irving’s 117 yards) and there might have been more if not for two Tampa Bay turnovers. The Buccaneers’ offense clearly isn’t as sexy as those operating in Buffalo or Detroit. However, you can’t argue with the results Coen has created. This unit lost wide receiver Chris Godwin for the season and Evans for three games to a hamstring injury. It still ranked fifth in the league in scoring coming into Sunday, and it’s likely to do more damage in the coming weeks. Coen will be a popular name when the head coach hiring cycle begins next month. With the exception of Bucco Bruce Arians, is Coen the best offensive coordinator this team has ever had? Dirk Koetter was pretty good but his offenses (a couple of times averaged scoring in the mid-20s) were sort of inconsistent — just like his quarterback. And when Koetter was the head coach, he had no running game. When he was forced to have a running game as an offensive coordinator for lousy Lovie Smith in 2015, the Bucs did well on the ground. Chucky was damn good, no question, but Chucky’s offenses didn’t put up points like Coen. The Bucs with Coen average 28.8 points a game, fourth in the NFL. Chucky’s teams only a couple of times inched above 20 points a game.|2024-12-17 03:45:00|391|45|8|Liam Coen|Highly praised offensive coordinator impresses with Bucs' performance.|5|Mixed sentiments on Coen staying with some optimism and concern about potential departures.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Hodad"", ""post"": ""Watch the Saints hire him."", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""17th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""4:38"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Leopold Stotch"", ""post"": ""He\u2019s going to get so much Glazer loot."", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""17th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""4:38"", ""am""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""August 1976 Buc"", ""post"": ""The team has never been able to run and pass like this in the history of the franchise since 1976"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""17th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""5:22"", ""am""]}, ""commenter3"": {""username"": ""LUVMYBUCS"", ""post"": ""test"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""17th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""5:36"", ""am""]}, ""commenter4"": {""username"": ""Michael"", ""post"": ""They\u2019ll never do it, but they should really let bowles go and hire Coen.

To put it mildly, JTS has been a massive disappointment for Bucs fans since being drafted in the first round in 2021. He just hasn’t developed into an edge rusher. But to be fair, Joe doesn’t think Todd Bowles and his right-hand man Kacy Rodgers are any good at developing young edge rushers. The next rookie edge rusher Bowles and Rodgers develop together into a double-digit each guy will be the first. Just check their history when together. So Daniel Popper who covers the Chargers for the The Athletic showed a couple of clips on Twitter of the Bucs defense and how it hounded Los Angeles quarterback Justin Herbert. In one clip it demonstrated how JTS faked how he was going to drop into pass coverage and instead fired into a pass rush and drilled Herbert just after Herbert released a pass. The very first commenter in the Twitter clip, a Chargers fan, was outraged JTS was not flagged for a late hit. You just know your team got its tail kicked in if fans are bellyaching about a JTS pass rush.|2024-12-17 00:00:00|198|33|2|Joe Tryon-Shoyinka|Bucs rookie disappoints Chargers fans with pass rush complaints.|2|Mixed opinions on player development and coaching impact on edge rushers.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Tony"", ""post"": ""So if we haven\u2019t developed Kancey & Vita into something better yet then watch out.
