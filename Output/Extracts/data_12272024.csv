https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/shaq-is-back-2/|Shaq Is Back|UPDATED: Bucs sacks king Shaq Barrett is back. The worst-kept secret is no longer. It’s true. Mere hours after Shaq cleared waivers after the Dolphins released him, Shaq is back with the Bucs where he became the team sacks king and won his second Super Bowl ring. The Bucs’ edge rush is miserable beyond words. Outrageously bad. And with the defense sputtering, in part because there is no edge rush — when your best edge rusher is a backup (Anthony Nelson), what can Joe say? At least Shaq has a history of putting quarterbacks on the ground, unlike the Bucs’ current crew.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/shaq-barrett-clear-for-tampa-landing/|Shaq Barrett Clear For Tampa Landing|Bucs sacks king Shaq Barrett is now formally a free agent. He cleared waivers, per the NFL Network ticker. That means he’s free to sign with the Bucs after being cut by the Dolphins this week. Shaq signed a fat contract with Miami in free agency back in March. He retired just prior to training camp in July. Months later, he told Kay Adams of Up & Adams that he is interested in returning for one NFL team: your Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Sadly, the Bucs could use Shaq. Joe suspects Shaq has more to offer than bottom-of-the-roster edger rusher José Ramirez, and very possibly Chris Braswell and Joe Tryon-Shoyinka. Collectively, the Bucs edge rushers have combined for a paltry eight sacks this season. His agent, oily Drew Rosenhaus, said publicly that Shaq is in great shape. If Shaq is signed, which feels like a sure thing, Joe suspects it will be next week, so the Bucs can save the price of a game check on Sunday and give Shaq a chance to practice.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/liam-coen-chatter-hits-nfl-network/|Liam Coen Chatter Hits NFL Network|Joe understands Bucs fans aren’t going to like to read the following. But Bucs offensive coordinator Liam Coen is going to be a popular name among NFL owners who have openings for a head coach, and those that invested heavily in a young starting quarterback. So this morning on “Good Morning Football,” seen on NFL Network, closet Bucs fan Peter Schrager offered up advice to the shot-callers in Chicago: If they want their massive investment in Caleb Williams to work, they may want to talk to Coen. Of the names Schrager rattled off who he thinks should be the next Bears coach, Coen was on the short list. “I really do think he needs an offensive head coach,” Schrager said of Bears rookie QB Caleb Williams. :I know this whole ‘leader of men’ thing is such a triggering topic. To me, any coach in the NFL is going to be a leader of men. You don’t get to that pinnacle by leading someone at some point. “But I would love to see someone who can draw up an offense and get the best out of [Williams]. I know Pete Carroll is being mentioned and Mike Vrabel… but I do lean towards the Ben Johnson, Liam Coen, Kliff Kingsbury offensive coach. “Because I know you have to put all of your investment into Caleb.” In general, Schrager is right. But Joe has a hunch Coen may not be quick to jump to Chicago. If a guy like Coen, who ought to have more than one job offer, looks around, the Bears may not be a strong option. Sure, they have Williams, who is no doubt a good young quarterback, but that organization is a mess. Outside of wide receiver targets, that roster is barren of talent. The Bears front office is a trainwreck, which stands to reason when it is being run by a 101-year old woman (“This is the way Daddy [George Halas] did it in 1948, and if it worked for him, then by gum it will work now.”). Look at all the corporate cash there is in Chicago and they can’t get a stadium built. Stan Kroenke found a way in football-sleepy Los Angeles. John Mara found a way to get a new stadium in New Jersey. But in the third-largest market of football-hungry Chicago, with all that local money and the Bears even owning a casino license, the Bears keep fumbling the ball both on and off the field. Joe still thinks the team to look out for is New England. The Patriots have a good young quarterback in Drake Maye and Patriots owner creepy Bob Kraft has an excellent organization set in place. Joe isn’t sure how much it hurts the Bucs that Coen is from Rhode Island, but Joe thinks the Patriots are a sneaky suitor. Cross your fingers that Coen isn’t blown away by any job offer and that he sticks around Tampa for at least another season. We are 10 days away from Black Monday. So Joe guesses Coen’s name will pop up quite a bit in the next couple of weeks linking him to openings.

Jaycee Horn, the No. 8 overall pick in the 2021 NFL Draft, has been a quality outside corner for Carolina but he did not practice today because of a hip injury. In his afternoon news conference, Canales was down about Horn, who had 6 combined tackles, 2 passes defended and a tackle for loss against the Bucs four weeks ago. He also was vicitmized by Mike Evans on a spectacular one-hand touchdown catch (video below).

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/more-studious-than-tom-brady/|More Studious Than Tom Brady?|Todd Bowles spent three years around Tom Brady, one as head coach. So Joe demanded silence at JoeBucsFan.com world headquarters this week when Bowles named the most football-studious player he’s ever seen. That would be third-year Bucs cornerback Zyon McCollum, Bowles told SiriusXM NFL Radio. “He studies more than anybody I’ve ever seen,” Bowles said. “And he’s one of the first guys out on the practice field every day working on his technique. Now I’ll be yelling at him this week because I didn’t like his technique [Sunday in Dallas], but he is determined to be a very good player in this league. He wants to be great. He studies to be great and he works at it constantly. He’s a heck of an athlete and the game has really slowed down for him.” Joe hoped for better from McCollum this season, but he’s had a good year in his first season as a full-time starter. Unlike his predecessor, Carlton Davis, McCollum hasn’t missed a game. McCollum battled through a hamstring issue to lead the Bucs in passes defensed with 12 and he’s proven to be a legit starter. Damn good for a fifth-round draft pick. On the Buccaneers Radio Network this week, assistant secondary coach Rashad Johnson added that McCollum does a great job with in-game adjustments and has stepped up his tackling.|2024-12-27 09:48:00|224|25|8|Zyon McCollum|Bowles praises McCollum's work ethic|2|Overall negative sentiment about defense, coaching, players, and team direction.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""TampaBayBucFan"", ""post"": ""Damn sure is better than Dean\u2026\u2026.at least he can tackle\u2026..I can\u2019t believe how soft Dean has become\u2026\u2026.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/nothing-short-of-incredible-baker-mayfield/|“Nothing Short Of Incredible” Baker Mayfield|Hardcore soccer fans likely are familiar with talkSport if they follow the English game. If they’re more interested in what Peter Vermes is doing in Kansas City, then they have no clue. Joe’s interest in talkSport this year was focused on the outlet’s chat with Bucs tight end Cade Otton. Based in the United Kingdom, talkSport is dabbling in NFL coverage and chatted with Otton before Tampa Bay was humbled by the Cowboys on Sunday night. Otton referenced how the team belongs to Baker Mayfield. “In reflection, I think we’ve taken on as a team who Baker is,” Otton said. “And it’s just competitive, a great communicator and a great player. You see who he is on Sundays, interviews, and that’s how he is all the time.” Otton added that Mayfield leads “elite, high-level” breakdowns for the offense every week. “He’s been nothing short of incredible since he got to Tampa,” Otton said, adding the Mayfield is “an awesome teammate.” Joe’s just happy the Bucs have a franchise quarterback. Two critical games remain this regular season, but it feels, smells and looks like the Bucs have a Super Bowl-capable QB for a few more seasons. That’s rarely been said through the nearly 50-year history of the team.|2024-12-27 09:24:00|207|45|8|Baker Mayfield|Mayfield praised as incredible QB leading Tampa Bay Buccaneers.|4|Mixed sentiments with some positivity towards Baker Mayfield but overall skepticism and criticism.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Pmike"", ""post"": ""We\u2019re something like 9-48 in our franchise history for 10+ win seasons."", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""27th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""9:31"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""DungyDance"", ""post"": ""Pmike \u2013 lol, that\u2019s a weird stat to dream up.

If you miss a starter, that’s bad. Otton had really raised his game since Mike Evans and Chris Godwin got hurt against the Crows. In fact, Otton may have become the Bucs’ most reliable target with Evans and Godwin out (aside from running backs Bucky Irving and Rachaad White). In praising the play against the Cowboys of Bucs backup tight end Payne Durham, offensive coordinator Coen tried to slip this past the local pen and mic club. “I thought [Durham] did some nice things and can continue to grow from this experience and continue to get more reps as we go,” Coen said. “Knowing that he’s probably, most likely, going to be the ‘Y’ [receiver] moving forward.” The “Y” receiver is the tight end. That didn’t make Otton’s bad knee sound promising. Since the start of last week, Otton has missed every practice with his bad knee except last Friday, when he only partially participated. His knee, however, was too injured to answer the bell in Dallas. He didn’t even make the trip. So it seems Otton won’t be available on Sunday against Carolina.|2024-12-27 03:56:00|201|15|2|Cade Otton|Otton likely out|4|Mixed sentiment with concerns about player injuries and performance, but some optimism and support shown.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""heyjude"", ""post"": ""We surely missed Otton last week.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/liam-coen-explains-why-bucky-irving-wasnt-used-more/|Liam Coen Explains Why Bucky Irving Wasn’t Used More|It was the weirdest thing. And Joe likened it to the loss to the 49ers when star Bucs running back Bucky Irving was nowhere to be found on a late drive to either tie or win the game. On Sunday, the last time Irving touched the ball in the loss to the Cowboys was a run from shotgun for no gain. That was with 10:01 left in the game. Offensive coordinator Liam Coen confessed yesterday that he should have gotten the ball to Irving more but circumstances dictated otherwise. The Bucs were playing catch-up and felt pressure to put the ball in the air a little more than they liked. “It was more of a throw, hand it off to keep them honest type of thing,” Coen said. “It wasn’t really a ‘Alright, hey, we’re huddle-calling designed plays at that moment.’ “The way the thing was going, was just very much pass heavy and we, at the time, felt better about Rachaad [White] being in there.” Irving and White each average 7.8 yards a catch. But what White does better than Irving is block and that’s a key reason why he was in the game and not Irving. “He’s our best protector,” Coen said of White’s blocking. Coen seemed to lean toward finding ways to get Irving on the field more late, regardless of blocking. “We definitely want to get Bucky more touches and carries as we go, for sure,” Coen said. Look, Joe believes in the Nick Saban School of Football, specifically winning close games. Saban said he learned in high school that clutch situations mean get the ball in the hands of your best players. That’s a philosophy he carried to the NFL and college jobs. Right now, Irving is playing as well as just about any running back in the league, sans Saquon Barkley and Derrick Henry.|2024-12-27 03:56:00|310|25|3|Bucky Irving|Liam Coen on limited use of Bucky Irving in game.|5|Mixed opinions on team performance with emphasis on Bucky, play calling, and defense.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""August 1976 Buc"", ""post"": ""Simple solution, have both on the field.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/cant-blame-antoine-winfield-for-poor-pass-defense/|Can’t Blame Antoine Winfield For Poor Pass Defense|BSPN NFL analyst Ben Solak suggested there is only one man to finger for the poor Bucs’ pass defense. And that person would be Bucs coach Todd Bowles, the de facto defensive coordinator. Solak, speaking on colleague Mina Kimes’ podcast, was tough on Bowles after watching Troy Aikman Cooper Rush slice and dice the Bucs defense in the first half Sunday. “Defensive regression/luck to the moon,” Solak howled. “This Bucs defense, man, there is so much air in the secondary. You would think they haven’t played zone coverage before. And they’ve done it all season.” Now Solak wanted to be fair. While he didn’t cite the specific stats, he said the numbers for the pass defense with and without All-Pro safety Antoine Winfield are striking. Still, Solak said, that’s no excuse for Aikman Rush to go bananas. “The CeeDee Lamb-less Cowboys should be the easiest pass [offense] to defend,” Solak said. Yes, Lamb did burn the Bucs badly, but he left the game with an injury. Solak doesn’t think Bowles adjusts his defense enough and he relies on the front-five, or a blitzing linebacker/defensive back to break through and disrupt the quarterback. It’s fine if it works, Solak added. The trick is if no one breaks through, then tremendous pressure is put on the secondary. And the Bucs secondary, Solak said, simply isn’t able to hold up: “It is so hot and cold and so inconsistent. There is so much space in the intermediate level with this team.” This is why Solak believes the Bucs’ postseason chances are very murky.|2024-12-27 03:45:00|260|23|3|Antoine Winfield|Winfield's impact on Bucs' pass defense criticized by analyst.|2|Frustration and disappointment with Todd Bowles and the defensive performance, calling for changes.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""MJ"", ""post"": ""the D needs to be overhauled in the off season, we need leaders, linebackers, corners and edge rushers\u2026"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""27th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""5:05"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""1sparkybuc"", ""post"": ""Replace the DC and the HC, and the Bucs will be much improved.
