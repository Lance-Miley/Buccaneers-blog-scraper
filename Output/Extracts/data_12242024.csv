https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/the-out-of-control-tsa-9/|The Out Of Control TSA|Yes, this is Joe’s sad Christmas Eve tradition. But it is an otherwise hopeful Christmas, as Santa has allowed the Bucs to still be “this close” to a division title. Let’s hope the Bucs can get a win over the slimy Saints and somehow the Dixie Chicks get tripped up by the Commandos. Back to the sad reality of life: The following is an example to demonstrate how the snooping of the federal government upon innocents gets out of hand without proper checks and balances. On his rounds from the North Pole this evening, Santa Claus was detained by TSA agents — tipped off by the IRS goons — who have decided to call in the notorious Jack Bauer to “interrogate” Santa in the bowels of CTU. Presumably, Santa is believed by the FAA to have forgotten his papers while flying over the fruited plains. (This, boys and girls, is why you cough up the $85 so you too can utilize TSA Pre like Joe and avoid harassment from the feds and not have to take your shoes off at the airport.)|2024-12-24 20:00:00|182|17|2|TSA|Santa detained by TSA agents|5|Mixed sentiments with some negativity and positivity regarding team performance and holiday wishes.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""PewterStiffArm"", ""post"": ""I wouldn\u2019t be shocked at all if they drop one of these two games coming up.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/todd-bowles-hasnt-ruled-out-jordan-whitehead-yet/|Todd Bowles Hasn’t Ruled Out Jordan Whitehead (Yet)|So the Bucs made the first step on Tuesday to bring back starting safety Jordan Whitehead to active status. And Bucs coach Todd Bowles wouldn’t rule him out for Sunday’s critical game with the Stinking Panthers. That doesn’t mean Whitehead will play. Just that Bowles isn’t sure if Whitehead has advanced in his rehab enough. “Mentally, yes,” Bowles said of Whitehead’s ability to play this coming weekend. “Physically, there are some things he could have done better. “Physically, there are some things he’s done well. I won’t know really until Thursday where he progresses to.” Bowles noted that Tuesday the team only had a walk-through practice. So with Thursday’s practice expected to be more intense (the Bucs will not practice on Christmas Day), Bowles said he may have a better idea of how Whitehead is progressing. Of course, Bowles is not scheduled to speak with the local pen and mic club until Friday after practice around noon. The Bucs have 21 days (three weeks) to activate Whitehead off injured reserve. Of course, that window lasts until the wild card round of the playoffs.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/todd-bowles-talks-too-soft-zone/|Todd Bowles Talks Too-Soft Zone|There have been happy times in recent years courtesy of the Todd Bowles zone defense, but there’s also been a lot of cringing and screaming. When the Bucs play zone, they seem to get in the most trouble (see the last Carolina game). Poor technique and zone play hurt the Bucs against the dink-and-dunk Cowboys on Sunday, and head coach Todd Bowles wasn’t shy about going there during his sitdown with WFLA-TV sports chief Dan Lucas. Lucas asked about the Cowboys getting a lot of seemingly easy 7- and 8-yard completions over the middle. Bowles said they should have been much shorter completions to set up third downs. “It should have been 3 and 4 [yards], there were only 3 passes that went past 10 yards,” Bowles said of the Cowboys. “Everything else was check-downs, either missed tackles or getting too wide in our drops and not coming back fast enough — things we talk about, things we practice, things we preach and things that didn’t happen [Sunday]. … It was no communication [issue]. We just either dropped too wide or we missed a tackle. That doesn’t require communication.” Bowles talked about fundamentals being a killer after the two-point loss, and this was a big part of what he was referencing. “We need to be in our right zone drops in order to make plays,” Bowles added. Tough stuff to stomach so late in a season. (Yeah, fumbles are in that category, too.) As for the zone defense, Joe sure hopes to see less of it on Sunday. When that soft zone meets no edge rush, bad things happen. Ira Kaufman Talks Emotional Loss, YaYa Diaby Comments, Todd Bowles Decisions, Overblown(?)

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/it-doesnt-need-to-be-talked-about/|“It Doesn’t Need To Be Talked About”|So the Bucs will have everything on the line Sunday at home against the Panthers. But don’t expect coaches to be drilling that into players all week. Nope. “It doesn’t need to be talked about,” Todd Bowles said today regarding the urgency of the Bucs’ situation. If you’ve just returned from a WiFi-free zone in Canada, the Bucs are 8-7 and tied with the Falcons atop the NFC South, but the Falcons own the tiebreaker with two games to play. The Bucs kick off at 1 p.m. and the Falcons will roll at the Commanders on Sunday Night Football. The Bucs are taking a very business-as-usual approach. Keep grinding and shut out the noise (allegedly), but Bowles says he won’t be drilling it into the team that, if all goes wrong, the Bucs could be out of the playoffs by Sunday night. Joe finds it interesting. There is no right or wrong way to approach, but some coaches would be hammering away at the Super Bowl nature of Sunday’s game against Carolina. Joe does hope Todd Bowles finds a new wrinkle to fire up his team Sunday, even if it isn’t tied to the standings. The Bucs haven’t played very well at home (3-4) and that must end in a hurry.|2024-12-24 14:08:00|211|33|3|Todd Bowles|Bucs preparing calmly for crucial game against Panthers.|4|Mixed sentiments towards Coach Todd Bowles with calls for improvement and criticism.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""#99 the big fella"", ""post"": ""You couldn\u2019t fire up Todd Bowles if you lit firecrackers in his pants"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""24th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""2:23"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Tampabaybucfan"", ""post"": ""Todd\u2026just tell them \u201cIf you want to get me fired\u2026lose this game\u201d"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""24th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""2:39"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""Pewter Power"", ""post"": ""The urgency of trying to get your team to the playoffs doesn\u2019t need to be talked about.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/baker-mayfield-passing-chart-vs-cowboys/|Baker Mayfield Passing Chart Vs. Cowboys|It seems Bucs offensive coordinator Liam Coen opened up the offense for Baker Mayfield on Sunday night. Joe has given updates on Coen’s offense just about every week using Mayfield’s passing chart courtesy of NextGen Stats. It seems Coen tried to go deep more than usual. Often, Mayfield may try three or four passes of 20 yards or more per game. That’s not many and Joe is confident Coen’s offense is dink-and-dunk. But it works. Sunday night, Mayfield tried seven passes of 20 yards or more. Joe isn’t sure if that was because the Bucs were playing catch-up most of the night or if there were opportunities for Mayfield to take advantage of. |2024-12-24 07:01:00|113|25|8|Baker Mayfield|Coen's offense opens up for deeper passes.|3|Mixed sentiments about team performance and coaching decisions are highlighted.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Bee"", ""post"": ""Baker did ok but he holds the ball way too long.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/where-was-bucky/|Where Was Bucky?|Joe loves listening to former Michigan State, LSU and Alabama coach Nick Saban. Every time Joe hears him, Joe learns something about football. Joe has heard the following story from Saban several times. It’s better to hear him detail it. But to summarize, Saban learned in high school the best strategy in crunch time is to get the ball in the hands of your best players. So with the Bucs down 11 points Sunday night, and with Chris Godwin and Cade Otton unavailable, who would you say was the Bucs’ best skill position player on offense aside from Mike Evans? Most people would say running back Bucky Irving. Joe would agree. So where was Irving late in the game? Per the NFL Official Gamebook of the Bucs-Cowboys game, the last time Irving touched the ball came with 10:01 left and the Bucs trailing 26-17. Irving ran out of a shotgun for no gain. So outside of Evans, the Bucs’ best weapon never got his paws on a football for the final 10 minutes. That’s borderline malpractice. Yesterday in his day-after presser, Bucs coach Todd Bowles noted Rachaad White is the Bucs’ two-minute back (yet it was the full final 10 minutes that Irving never saw the ball). Bowles also noted one reason White was on the field was for his blocking, which Joe gets. Yes, Joe knows the Bucs rallied and had a chance to win the game when White fumbled. This battle plan seemed to be a repeat of the loss to the 49ers. When the Bucs drove to try to win the 49ers game late against San Francisco, the Bucs had to settle for a field goal on that drive to tie the game. The only time Irving touched the ball on the Bucs’ final drive against San Francisco was the second play of the drive when he recovered a Baker Mayfield fumble. On first- and second-down and goal, White tried to punch it in twice from the eight but collectively didn’t gain a yard. Given how the Bucs are now 2-5 in one-score games this year, maybe it’s time to rethink who should be getting the ball in crunch time? If the Bucs somehow backdoor their way into the playoffs, it’s a safe bet they may be in a close game. Joe’s pretty sure Irving would get the ball if he was playing for Saban.|2024-12-24 07:00:00|398|40|3|Bucky Irving|Late-game play-calling critique surrounding Bucky Irving's absence.|5|Mixed sentiments on coaching decisions, performance criticisms, lack of unity, and accountability issues.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Eli"", ""post"": ""I can only hope that we have seen the last loss with Bowles!"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""24th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""7:18"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""SB"", ""post"": ""Imagine where our run game may be had we started Bucky day one."", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""24th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""7:19"", ""am""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""itzok"", ""post"": ""Please cut White.

That didn’t happen Sunday, but Irving still performed well: 16 carries for 68 yards and a touchdown. And he had three more catches for 24 yards. It was certainly a solid game, just not by Irving standards, which illustrates what a gem the Bucs have in the fourth-round rookie. On the year, Irving now has 920 yards rushing on only 168 carries. That’s 5.5 yards per rush, the most efficient season by a Buccaneers full-time running back in history. Perhaps even more impressive is Irving leading the NFL in catch percentage at 95.3 percent. He’s caught 41 of 43 targets for 320 yards. Hopefully, Irving hits the 1,000-yard rushing mark on Sunday. He already has the most yards among rookie running backs. But hitting the stud benchmark of 1,000 with still one game remaining would make Irving’s remarkable season that much more special. The Panthers, Sunday’s opponent, had absolutely no answer for Irving in their first meeting — 25 carries for 152 yards and a touchdown. Joe sure would like to see Carolina be forced to stop a steady and early diet of Irving.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/selling/|Selling|Hey, can you hear it? Joe still can. Hell, we all heard it just three days ago. All Bucs fans. “You don’t want to play this team in the playoffs.” That was the rallying cry from all the talking heads and the hollering shows on national sports TV and radio shows last week after the Bucs curb-stomped the Chargers. The Bucs were the hot team. They can make a run, the folks chattered. Baker Mayfield, Todd Bowles, Mike Evans, Bucky Irving. They’ve got it going on. Oh, they sure did. They walked into Dallas and then asked the towel boys for gallons of bleach so they could clean off the shat from their pants and shoes. The Bucs strutted into Big-D like the new bullies on the block. They left asking homeless for loose dimes and nickels because they had their lunch money (and touchdowns) stolen from the clutches of their own mitts. Jeffri Chadiha of NFL.com is now done with the Bucs. In a column where he buys or sells contender chances for 19 NFL teams still with playoff hopes, Chadiha is washing his hands of Tampa Bay. Chadiha saw all he needed to see Sunday night when the Bucs had their playoff hopes on the line. When it comes to the Bucs and a playoff run, Chadiha is selling. The Buccaneers did the one thing they could ill-afford to do this weekend: lose a winnable game. In falling to Dallas on Sunday night, Tampa Bay dropped into a first-place tie with Atlanta, which does the Buccaneers no good since Atlanta owns the tiebreaker on the strength of winning both games between the two teams. The Bucs finish with an easier schedule — they’ll face the Panthers and Saints — but they no longer control their destiny. They need Atlanta to lose somewhere in the next two weeks. Joe was a believer after watching the Bucs take apart the Chargers. After Sunday night, well, Joe doesn’t trust this team. How is Joe supposed to trust a team that on national television against an oppoinent just eliminated from the playoffs with a backup quarterback, would play so sloppy and get called out by its head coach for poor fundamentals — the core responsiblity of that same coach. The Bucs may still win the division, but Joe doesn’t know which team will show up. Will it be the team that alley-beat the Chargers or the team that puked all over themselves and got pistol-whipped by the Cowboys?|2024-12-24 03:45:00|416|51|2|Bucs|Bucs' playoff hopes take a hit after disappointing loss.|2|Overall, pessimistic views dominate due to concerns about coaching and team performance issues.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Steven #55"", ""post"": ""This could be a really good team next year if we trade for an edge rusher and draft defense.

The clock management issues, timeouts, and not going for 2 in KC are on Bowles as is the team going \u201cturtle\u201d in the ATL.  If the Bucs do not win out, I do not see the Bucs keeping him.  Anyhow it is evident that as long as Bowles is coach, the Bucs will not win many prime time games,  I guess the last game the Bucs won with a national audience is the playoff game vs a crippled Philly club.  Only playing the one home game on prime time and 3 on the road did not help either.  Thanks to the team\u2019s inability to win a prime time game now the Bucs need a loss by the ATL on Sunday night or a loss by Washington the next week vs the same Dallas team that outplayed the Bucs while the Bucs do not lose to Canales and the Saints.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/biggest-present-for-bucs/|Biggest Present For Bucs|Joe understands that humorist/NFL columnist Mike Tanier isn’t everyone’s cup of tea. But Joe thinks he’s one of the better NFL writers out there. Joe Flacco’s high school math teacher, Tanier believes he figured out the best Christmas present for Tampa Bay. Tanier offered a stocking stuffer for each NFL team in the final hours of Christmas shopping on his substack “Too Deep Zone.” For the Bucs, it would be a pricey piece of jewelry under the Christmas tree that cancer DeSean Jackson hadn’t destroyed which could help the Bucs for years to come. Handcuffs so Liam Coen cannot escape to take a head coaching job. They can be golden handcuffs. Or, like, sexy handcuffs. Gronk might have left a pair of those lying around somewhere. Hey, if Gronk’s better half Camille Kostek comes with those cuffs, talk about an incentive to stay! Joe gets what Tanier is suggesting. Joe has touched upon this. Whatever deal needs to be done to persuade Coen to stick around calling plays, that would be a massive and smart investment.|2024-12-24 00:00:00|176|32|6|Bucs|Tanier suggests Christmas presents for NFL teams.|3|Fans are conflicted on Bowles and Coen, with concerns about defense and head coaching abilities.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Tony"", ""post"": ""Biggest present for the Bucs would be:"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""24th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""12:06"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Mac"", ""post"": ""Amen  Tony!

Now hopefully Kraft and his crew are patient with Mayo but as we seen with Canales, there is no guarantee if Coen is allowed to interview that he will return to the Bucs.  Everyone thought Canales was just getting the complimentary interview to satisfy the Rooney rule in Carolina, but Canales got the job; probably because no one else wanted it but he still left, and Coen is a much more desirable candidate.   Lock him up with a deal he cannot refuse even if that means launching Bowles.  Personally, haven\u2019t the Glazers figured out that Bowles will always be Bowles with his stubbornness, soft zones and inability to manage a game clock and time outs.
