https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/twenty-coaches-got-better-player-grades-than-todd-bowles/|Twenty Coaches Got Better Player Grades Than Todd Bowles|So Joe wrote about some results from the Bucs’ 2025 players union report card, a compilation of player assessments of various team aspects. Todd Bowles got a “B+” grade from Bucs players. That’s a strong grade until further review, with an assist to ProFootballTalk.com. Twenty NFL head coaches got a better grade. Why would 20 head coaches get higher grades from their players? Bowles treats players with respect, the team had a winning record, he goes easy on practice compared to other coaches and Bowles doesn’t throw players under the bus publicly. Interestingly, Bowles’ grade went up from a B- a year ago, and the Bucs didn’t have a ton of roster turnover. So that’s a strong sign. How does Bowles grade himself? Joe’s not sure, but Bowles did tell Joe in an exclusive sitdown this week at the NFL Scouting Combine. “I coach my ass off.“ You can hear that exchange below: Of course, players loving a head coach deeply doesn’t equate to wins. Falcons head man Raheem Morris got an A+ grade after his first season in Atlanta. Panthers head coach Dave Canales, the 2023 Bucs offensive coordinator, got an A-. |2025-03-01 16:37:00|193|41|7|Todd Bowles|Players give him high grade; questions on impact on wins.|2|Mixed opinions on Bowles, some critical, some defending, overall uncertainty and divided sentiments.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Hearty Dikerson"", ""post"": ""Because maybe the players see the same things many of us fans see.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/kyle-trask-and-the-raiders/|Kyle Trask And The Raiders|So the Raiders made their move this week on 37-year-old pocket passer quarterback Matthew Stafford and failed. He’s staying with the Rams. That told Joe that new Raiders offensive coordinator Chip Kelly was/is preparing an offense for a dropback passer. (Why Raiders football czar Tom Brady didn’t demand his team at least interview Byron Leftwich for the playcaller opening is unclear.) So perhaps Kelly will have an offense that suits a Stafford-style QB, a big-armed guy with very limited mobility. That sounds to Joe like an ideal offense for pending Bucs free agent QB Kyle Trask. Todd Bowles and Jason Licht each said this week they’d like to have Trask return for his fifth Tampa Bay season, but Trask likely wants to play where he has more opportunity. Might that be Vegas? Brady spent two years with Trask and new Raiders GM John Spytek served a four-year team around Trask in Tampa. He turns 27 next week and has never started a game in the NFL. The Raiders have veteran QB Gardner Minshew under contract along with Aidan O’Connell, their 2023 fourth-round pick. Minshew, however, could become a salary cap casualty. Will anyone but the Bucs want Mr. Trask?

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/being-on-the-same-page-leads-to-draft-success/|Jason Licht: Being On The Same Page Leads To Draft Success|Bucs AC/DC-loving general manager Jason Licht hammered the last two drafts like Hank Aaron with fastballs right down the pipe. How does he do it? Simple, sort of, Licht explained. Speaking this week from the Indiana Convention Center in downtown Indianapolis at the combine, Licht rattled off the names of several of his personnel assistants. And he made sure to mention new Raiders general manager John Spytek. But the reason for his draft success is based on a couple of things, Licht said. One is those scouts. They understand what Licht looks for in a player and understand the traits he covets. Also, Licht added, the Bucs try to bring in players with the skillsets Bucs coaches need for them to thrive. In other words, everyone in the football operations wing of the Bucs has to be on the same page. “But it’s the scouting staff that has done such a great job,” Licht said. “They know what I’m looking for, they know what Todd [Bowles] is looking for and we know the kind of person that we’re looking for and we see what a great locker room can accomplish and so we want to continue to keep those types of players coming in.” Easier said than done. But together with good scouts understanding what the big boss and coaches want, and having an incubator to develop talent, it has all come together for Licht and company in player procurement.|2025-03-01 11:00:00|240|33|8|Jason Licht|Draft success through alignment and player development efforts.|3|Mixed reactions ranging from criticism of draft picks to appreciation for Licht's performance.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""BucsfaninOregon"", ""post"": ""All well and good.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/calijah-kancey-the-airbnb/|Calijah Kancey & The Airbnb|So Joe has written about how stud Bucs defensive tackle Calijah Kancey has an unlikely relationship with former NFL offensive lineman Brian Baldinger. Heck, “Baldy” retired from the game 30-plus years ago. Baldinger now works for NFL Network is known for breaking down on film on social media. At the NFL Scouting Combine this week, Joe caught up with Baldinger for a private chat and he shared more about how Kancey impresses him. The two met on the beach in Fort Lauderdale a couple of weeks after Kancey was drafted by the Bucs in 2023. It was Kancey who reached out when their paths randomly crossed on the sand with a ‘Hey Baldy,’ per Baldinger. That led to the two training daily on the beach and a relationship was formed. Baldinger called Kancey a “tireless worker” and they have a bond built on mutual respect. “A lot of his pass rush ability is man-made,” Baldinger said of Kancey. “You know, his ability to just to react and his movement skills, and his ability just to feel pressure, react and counter it, it’s pretty elite, pretty substantial considering how young he is.” Kancey has great leverage, great hands, all the things you need to be a great defensive lineman, Baldinger said, adding that Kancey uses being undersized to his advantage so it’s not a negative. Still, Baldinger came back to Kancey’s stunning work ethic and how well he talks and thinks the game. “I don’t know how many of these guys will go rent an Airbnb on the beach — and then be on the beach every day with all of your drills and go through it,” Baldinger said of Kancey. “Impressive, impressive guy.” Happy birthday to Kancey! He turned just 24 years old today.|2025-03-01 09:17:00|294|20|7|Calijah Kancey|NFL player impresses with work ethic and talent.|8|Overall, the comments express high optimism and positive expectations towards the players and team.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""JimBobBuc"", ""post"": ""Great work effort from Calijah.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/jason-licht-dont-give-up-on-chris-braswell/|Jason Licht: Don’t Give Up On Chris Braswell|Now a bunch of Joe’s readers wonder why Joe hasn’t teed off on Bucs edge rusher/outside linebacker Chris Braswell. Simple. Despite Braswell being a Nick Saban product, he was almost totally MIA as a rookie last season. Saban may have been the best college coach at producing plug-in-and-play NFL defenders. The Bucs’ second-round pick 57th overall had only 1.5 sacks, damn near MIA. But Joe didn’t and hasn’t been bent about Braswell. History says rookie edge rushers rarely make an impact. For every Nick Bosa you have a dozen Joe Tryon-Shoyinkas. But dang, 1.5 sacks is a little too close to tackling dummy range. This week, Licht advised folks not to throw in the towel on Braswell. “I think he has all the traits, both as a person and a player to make a big jump,” Licht said. “We did a little study on edge rushers in their first year. Some of them have a good first year, a lot of them… The team that won the Super Bowl took a first-rounder and his rookie year, he had one sack and played very little and this year, he had 10 or 11 sacks and played a huge part in their Super Bowl run. “It’s that second year that you kind of like to see a jump and I think he’s definitely got the mentality for it. He’s excited to show what he can do in that second year. “Sometimes, you have to get used to the pace of the game, the speed of the game, and the physicality. There’s a lot of intricacies and variables in the defense that can overwhelm a lot of people so he’s not one that’s going to be overwhelmed this year.” Let’s be real: Since Bucs coach/defensive coordinator Todd Bowles took over the defense in Arizona in 2013, he has developed as many rookie edge rushers into double-digit sack guys as you and Joe. Does Joe have hope for Braswell? Of course. Hope, unfortunately, never puts a quarterback on his tail.|2025-03-01 08:00:00|336|36|5|Chris Braswell|Bucs edge rusher Chris Braswell's potential for improvement discussed by Licht.|3|Mixed sentiments about edge rushers and coaching staff, uncertainty and hope for improvement.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Beeej"", ""post"": ""THIS is why we need to trade for or sign an FA edge"", ""post_time"": [""March"", ""1st,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""8:05"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Marine Buc"", ""post"": ""Re-sign A.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/bspn-best-free-agent-fit-for-bucs/|BSPN: Best Free Agent Fit For Bucs|In a near-perfect world, Bucs AC/DC-loving general manager Jason Licht will sign a proven edge rusher in free agency. (In a perfect world, Licht would trade for a proven edge rusher and use the Team Glazer free agent loot elsewhere.) In the world of Aaron Schatz, the creator of DVOA and founding father of Football Outsiders (RIP), the Bucs would use Team Glazer free agent loot on an edge rusher. And that man would be Josh Sweat. Schatz decided to plug in the best free agent fit for each NFL team and it’s Sweat for Tampa Bay. Although the Buccaneers were a surprising 11th in pass rush win rate (41.7%) this past season, they’re probably losing several edge rushers to free agency, including Anthony Nelson and Joe Tryon-Shoyinka. Enter Sweat, fresh off an impressive Super Bowl LIX performance. He had six tackles, three quarterback hits and 2.5 sacks. Sweat also had eight sacks during the regular season and 33 pressures. He will be 28 next season, so he’s right in the prime of his career. Would Joe whine about Sweat if the Bucs signed him? No. Joe just has the feel with Sweat, the Bucs would be buying high. His last good game happened to be the last NFL game played so that is fresh in people’s minds. Instead, Joe would rather Licht trade for Titans edge rusher Harold Landry. He has better production than Sweat and is the same age. What Joe finds important is that without much around him outside of Jeffery Simmons, Landry produced. Sweat had studs all around him.|2025-03-01 00:00:00|263|29|8|Josh Sweat|Free agent edge rusher target for Buccaneers.|3|Mixed sentiments on edge rushers and the team's approach to draft and trades.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Saskbucs"", ""post"": ""Agreed.
