https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/made-himself-a-dominant-edge-player/|“Made Himself A Dominant Edge Player”|The greatness of new Bucs edge rusher Haason Reddick is not overlooked by one iconic Buccaneer. After all, Reddick landed in a mess out of college, one that took years to correct. Drafted by Arizona in 2017, under head coach Bruce Arians, Reddick had three head coaches and three defensive coordinators in his first three seasons. And they all put him at inside linebacker. How many players emerge with multiple Pro Bowls after that? That’s not lost on Hall of Fame Bucs cornerback Rondé Barber, who told the No Off Days podcast that he loves the Reddick signing for Tampa Bay. “I love the way that he plays. I love how he’s overcome his own adversity,” Barber said. “Early in his career, they didn’t even know where to play him. If you remember, when Arizona drafted him, when Bruce Arians drafted him and didn’t know where to play him — stand-up or inside linebacker. But he kind of redefined himself and made himself a dominant edge player and it’s clearly one of our weaknesses.” The “redefined himself” impresses Joe a ton. Reddick balled out as an edge rusher in 2020 and left in free agency to Carolina. He crushed it there, too, and then was dominant in Philadelphia. Has there ever been a double-digit sacker with four different teams? Joe can’t think of one. But that Bucs sure hope/expect that’s Reddick. |2025-03-16 19:26:00|231|18|7|Haason Reddick|Overcame adversity|5|Mixed sentiments towards player acquisitions and analysis despite potential upside noted by some fans.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Pickgrin"", ""post"": ""\u201cHas there ever been a double-digit sacker with four different teams?

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/talent-upgrade-in-charlie-heck/|Talent Upgrade In Charlie Heck|Former Bucs reserve offensive tackle Justin Skule was on the street for weeks before the Bucs put him on their practice squad in 2022. The 2019 sixth-round pick of the 49ers looked to be done after tearing his ACL before the 2021 season. But, as has been common practice, Buccaneers Ring of Honor general manager Jason Licht had a sharp eye for O-line potential and made Skule a rehab project, and he delivered well last season at left and right tackle after a brutal first game filling in for Luke Goedeke. Now Skule is in Minnesota and some Bucs fans are nervous. Change is always unsettling, but the Bucs did get bigger, more athletic, more experienced and, Joe presumes, more talented at the position by signing free agent Charlie Heck this week. Heck measured a whisker under 6-8 at the NFL Scouting Combine in 2020, and he was 311 pounds with a 28-inch vertical leap. He was a very big man running a 5.16 40-yard dash. Drafted by the Texans in Round 4, Heck was well known in Houston for remaking his body. He transformed into a much leaner 308 pounds and was the Texans’ starting right tackle in 2021. A year later, Heck lost his starting gig under a new coaching staff (Lovie Smith) and then stuck around for another Texans coaching staff in 2023 before playing for the Cardinals and 49ers last season. Simply put, Heck, 28, has a lot more experience (23 starts) than Skule and seems to be more talented. Heck is the son of Chiefs offensive line coach and 12-year NFL lineman Andy Heck, so he’s got a pedigree. And Joe wonders what Charlie Heck could achieve in Tampa with what might be the best O-line coaches he’s been around and the best linemen he’s worked alongside. The Bucs coached up Skule, and they might coach up Heck to his likely untouched ceiling.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/baker-mayfield-must-see-tv/|Baker Mayfield = “Must-See TV”|So two big-name ex-Bucs in the national spotlight are massive Baker Mayfield fans. On this football Sunday, Joe enjoyed the Fitz & Whit podcast featuring retired QB Ryan Fitzpatrick and left tackle Andrew Whitworth. Their guest? Jon Gruden. Joe’s interest piqued when Fitzpatrick said his “must-see TV” quarterbacks each week are Josh Allen, Mayfield and Matthew Stafford. He then asked Gruden what QBs drive him to watch every one of their snaps. Chucky jumped on the Mayfield ship, along with those of Jared Goff and Joe Burrow. “I love what Mayfield’s doing here, Ryan. I went to see him play the 49ers, he deserves a lot of credit,” Gruden said of Mayfield. “I love Jared Goff. I love the way the Lions play offense. They do a lot at the line of scrimmage. They do a lot before the ball is snapped. I’m really interested into what I call ‘R.C.E.’ Recognition, that leads to communication, which leads us to high levels of execution. I love seeing quarterbacks that are in charge of recognizing the blitz, getting their teams in good play selection.” Yeah, Mayfield was that good last year. He was so underrated for throwing 41 touchdowns with 16 interceptions, and 4,500 yards with a stunning 71.4 percent completion rate. Can Mayfield repeat that performance? Joe’s not sure, but Joe does know Mayfield should be able to take lots of pressure off his rookie playcaller, which is a very good thing.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/major-respect-for-joe-tryon-shoyinka/|Major Respect For Joe Tryon-Shoyinka|After only 16 sacks in his 72 Bucs games, struggling edge rusher Joe Tryon-Shoyinka has left the building. Few Tampa Bay fans will miss him, but Tryon-Shoyinka moved on in a professional manner and commands respect. That was the word from his former Bucs position coach, Larry Foote. Joe asked Foote for a final thought on Tampa Bay’s 2021 first-round pick, who will earn $4.75 million next season with the Browns. “It was good. I don’t know if he reached his expectations that, you know, he wanted. But he did a lot of good ball for us,” Foote said. “Hope for the best for him up in Cleveland. Gonna be a big adjustment weatherwise. But Joe is a great guy. Even when he was being demoted, he kept the same attitude and juice. I really respect that about him.” Great to hear Tryon-Shoyinka was a class act as the Bucs cut his playing time last season. Joe has read many reports of the Tryon-Shoyinka signing from Cleveland and it seems he’s eager to get in a more attack-minded front with Browns defensive coordinator Jim Schwartz. Photos of JTS hugging it up with Myles Garrett made Joe chuckle. Joe will be paying attention to see if JTS is a different player (better or worse) at his new stop.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/jihaad-campbell-and-the-bucs/|Jihaad Campbell And The Bucs|Joe often likes to say that what a team does in free agency is a window into its upcoming draft. Fans know what holes there are on the Bucs roster before the combine when (coughcough) illegal tampering kicks off (coughcough). So the holes remaining after free agency are likely the draft targets. Despite Lavonte David coming back at inside linebacker, the position is still a major need, maybe more so than cornerback. The Bucs really pumped up SirVocea Dennis at the combine and Joe agrees he has untapped potential. Bucs coach Todd Bowles even said when Dennis got hurt and was lost for the season with a bum shoulder, his absence hurt the defense. Given how terrible the pass defense was, specifically in the middle of the field, Joe believes Bowles. For all the talent Dennis flashes, though, he cannot stay on the field. For all we know, Dennis could be the next Derrick Brooks but if he’s in the tub it doesn’t matter. So will the Bucs really bank on an injury-prone inside linebacker when it appears this team has a real shot to make a Super Bowl run? Throw in that David is very likely entering his final season, and one can see how badly the Bucs need an inside linebacker. Joe has been really, really high on this Jihaad Campbell out of Alabama. He could be the linebacker that the Bucs thought Devin White would/should have been. And since off-ball linebackers like Campbell don’t normally go high in the draft, there’s a shot he could be there at No. 19. Jordan Reid of BSPN is high on Campbell, too. But based on free agency, Reid isn’t sure Campbell will be on the board when the Bucs pick at No. 19. The way off-ball linebackers got paid in free agency tells him teams have a higher value on that position this year. Off-ball linebackers have surprisingly become hot commodities in free agency. Both teams that were just in the Super Bowl paid hefty prices to keep the centerpieces of their defenses in place, as Zack Baun returned to the Eagles on a three-year, $51 million deal while the Chiefs brought back Nick Bolton on a three-year, $45 million contract. The Jets also re-signed Jamien Sherwood before free agency after his big season. With the growing emphasis on the running game, teams showed they would spend on the position this offseason. None of those three backers Reid cited were first-round picks. Bolton was picked in the second round, Baun in the third and Sherwood in the fifth. While Reid isn’t sure that Campbell will be available at No. 19, Reid seems pretty certain Campbell will land in the NFC South. And if he’s there at No. 19, you can go ahead and print up a Bucs No. 11 jersey for him (sorry Michael Pratt). Campbell is my No. 14 player in this class and the prototype at the position. He could be drafted as high as No. 8 (Panthers), and his floor is likely No. 19 (Buccaneers). The Falcons at No. 15 make a lot of sense as a landing spot, as they need linebackers and players capable of rushing the quarterback. Drafting Campbell just may make this Bucs defense complete. Haason Reddick will ignite a dormant pass rush, Joe believes. And Campbell next to David seems frightening (in a good way). The only element left is a quality backup corner because there are three sure things in life: death, taxes and Jamel Dean being unable to finish a playoff game. Man, Joe sure hopes Dean can find a magic elixir to stay healthy.

And yeah, maybe it does apply to coaching. But it seems, at least for new Bucs edge rusher Haason Reddick, his relationship with Bucs outside linebackers coach Larry Foote was a key reason why Reddick chose Tampa Bay. Football is about relationships. Reddick and Foote first crossed paths in Arizona. They reunite in Tampa Bay. When Reddick was a first-round pick of Arizona in 2017, Foote was the Cardinals’ inside linebackers coach. And right away, to hear Foote talk on Friday, the Cardinals made a mistake with Reddick. The rookie edge rusher was moved to inside linebacker, a position he had never played. Joe asked Foote about this Friday and Foote said someone higher up the food chain than him saw Reddick “was a freak” playing off-the-ball linebacker during Senior Bowl practices. The Cardinals thought they had a monster on their hands and moved Reddick inside. “It’s a big factor, you know, the connection, just how he helped me grow as a player, as a young player out in Arizona,” Reddick said of his reunion with Foote. “You know, the time, the attention that he took to make sure — he understood my situation, right? A kid coming into the league who’s never played inside linebacker before, somebody who was able to do it the way he did it in his career, he understood that. “[Foote’s] effort, his approach, everything that he gave me. A lot of that stuff stuck with me and allowed me to continue to grow as a player moving forward. “So to reconnect with him, maybe it will be me teaching him some things this time around — nah! (Laughs)” After Reddick went to the Eagles — by that time Foote was coaching in Tampa — whenever the Eagles and Bucs played, Foote found Reddick and made sure everything was good with him personally and professionally. Those gestures deepened Reddick’s appreciation. “It’s great to be back around with [Foote],” Reddick said. “I’ve always loved his energy, even when we got to play against him. No matter where he was coaching, he always had the time and was excited to see me. “[Foote] made sure they we would talk. He’d ask me about my family, things [like] that. We always kept the connection. So it is great to be back [with Foote].” So football is sometimes about relationships with players. When the Bucs were trying to recruit Reddick, the Bucs already had a built-in advantage.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/tristan-wirfs-knows-how-to-make-hot-women-feel-old/|Tristan Wirfs Knows How To Make Women Feel Old|Bucs left tackle Tristan Wirfs may have a future in comedy if he plans to work after his football days are done. Last week Wirfs sat down for a “live” podcast at a Bucs event at The Licht House called “She is Football,” a two-day celebration of women and football. FOX Sports personalities/sideline reporters Erin Andrews and Charissa Thompson were part of the festivities and recorded their podcast “Calm Down.” Wirfs was a special guest and at one point was referred to by Andrews as “cutie pie.” (Strangely, Thompson referenced a bachelor party she attended the previous evening. Not bachelorette. “Bachelor.”) There, Wirfs decided to tread upon a subject women over 40 detest: calendars. Andrews and Thompson are in that group. So the subject of being a rookie drafted to keep Tom Brady on his two feet came up. Wirfs explained the pressure that was on him. “[The Bucs are] like, ‘Don’t let anyone touch him,'” Wirfs said. “I said, ‘OK, I’ll try my best. He’s fragile, he’s old.'” This sparked gasps and laughs from the crowd of (mostly?) women. The nerve of Wirfs to refer to then-43-year-old Brady as “old!” Wirfs immediately realized the audience and then held out his palm and said, “Not that old, not that old. Not that old, ladies. Not that old.” The remark got a reaction from Andrews, who cautioned Wirfs, “Tristan! He’s a year older than me. Calm down!” To which Wirfs responded, “He’s like two years younger than my mom.” Rim shot! Careful there, Tristan. Comedy like that may get you in hot water in the future. Don’t want to alienate half your potential market — if you don’t sit back and enjoy the good life after you retire from football. Also interesting, since this was recorded a week ago, Wirfs announced that his good friend and now former Bucs backup center Robert Hainsey was “going somewhere” in free agency. Joe wonders if this was all worked out during the illegal tampering period at the combine?
