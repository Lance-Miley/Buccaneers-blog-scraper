https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/the-cade-otton-fade/|The Cade Otton Fade|Joe’s got faith in Bucs No. 1 tight end Cade Otton, but it’s slipping away slightly, much like balls slip through Otton’s hands too often this season. What tight end leads the NFL in drops? Well, drops are a subjective stat, which is why the NFL doesn’t publish an official “drops” stat. One man’s “drop” is another man’s bad throw. Still, FOX Sports data says Otton has 8 drops this season, which is most among tight ends and tied for third-most in the NFL. It’s extra disappointing to see Otton’s production slip and his drops increase lately because Otton was on a tear with Mike Evans out with a hamstring injury. Evans returned and Otton fell off. One might think it would be the other way around; Evans’ return would have drawn attention from Otton and freed him up for chunk plays. Bucs head coach Todd Bowles was asked about Otton’s performance dip in the passing game on the Buccaneers Radio Network this week. The head coach quipped it’s because Otton shaved his head, “he cut his hair.” Joe got a laugh, but this is serious business. Whether it be at tight end or from a secondary receiver — and certainly on defense — the Bucs need a few players to raise their games down the stretch if they hope to reach the postseason and do real damage in it. Otton could be one of those guys. And the Bucs certainly can’t afford for Otton to take a half-step backward.|2024-12-04 17:36:00|250|20|2|Cade Otton|Struggle with drops and performance|3|Mixed sentiments with criticisms and hopes for improvement in player performance.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""A Bucs Fan"", ""post"": ""It\u2019s been since the second half of the 49ers game.

They’re cool, but heck, Sean Tucker got one and Mike Glennon was once NFC Rookie of the Month. So Joe keeps them in perspective. That said, congratulations to electric Bucs rookie running back Bucky Irving for winning NFC Offensive Player of the Week today. Joe hasn’t seen a more dangerous Bucs running back in a long time, maybe ever. Irving’s 5.5 yards per carry average, if he can keep it over 5.1 for the regular season, would represent the best per-rush mark by a full-time Bucs running back in history. Sunday, in the painfully sweet Bucs win at Carolina, Irving cruised to 152 rushing yards and 185 yards from scrimmage, more than any NFC player.

But Evans had a heck of a game Sunday, his best yardage production since his kick-ass effort against Detroit in the playoffs. All good, right? Maybe not. The Bucs pumped out their official injury report this afternoon, the first of the week, and Evans appears with a calf injury. That’s new. No word on when/how it happened, but the report claims Evans would not have practiced today if the Bucs had a real practice. The hamstring also remains on the injury report, as it was before Sunday’s game.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/todd-bowles-on-man-vs-zone-defense/|Todd Bowles On Man Vs. Zone Defense|So on Sunday, when the Bucs played man-to-man defense against Stinking Panthers quarterback Bryce Young, he struggled mightily. The second-year quarterback completed just 21 percent of his throws against the Bucs’ man coverage, connecting on only 3 of 14 attempts for 56 yards. Really, really strong work by the Bucs. But then, when the Bucs played zone defense, Young looked more like Steve Young and picked the zone defense apart like he was throwing against Florida State. The 2023 No. 1 overall pick looked like the star prospect he was thought to be, not the benched quarterback he appeared to be facing Todd Bowles’ man coverage. Young against Bowles’ zone was borderline lethal hitting on 23 of 32 attempts for a season-high 242 yards (against zone defenses). So why the disparity? Why not use man more since it appeared the Bucs had Young on lockdown? Bowles said the Bucs played zone defense for a reason. “It was all situational,” Bowles said. “We played quite a bit of man, but we can’t play man all game.” Bowles is completely correct here — that you can’t play man all the time. Nobody would expect or encourage the Bucs to go full-blown man defense. But since man was working so well, why not use it more against Young, just a little more? You know, adjust to what is working. Bowles seemed to think the lack of a pass rush was the culprit. Can you imagine? “We’ve got to get to the quarterback,” Bowles said. “He’s very athletic using his feet. “With a four-man rush, he kind of got away from our bigger guys and bought some time for himself. It’s a credit to him.” This is also true. Sometimes, you have to just doff your cap to a great athlete making athletic plays. Young is a professional paid (handsomely) to make plays, drafted No. 1 overall for a reason. Look, Joe admits to bellyachging about a lack of an edge rush for years. Part of that is because an edge rush is vital if not critical for a team to make a deep run into the playoffs. There’s a reason why good edge rushers make truckloads of cash. Perhaps the Bucs not losing sleep over an edge rush is coming back to haunt the team.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/ready-baker-mayfield/|Ready Baker Mayfield|Pro Bowl quarterback Baker Mayfield squares up Sunday against future Hall of Fame Raiders QB Aiden O’Connell at The Licht House for a 1 o’clock kickoff.  Yeah, Joe’s being sarcastic. O’Connell was a fourth-round pick last season and while his rookie season was promising, O’Connell hasn’t done much in 2024. One reason is because he has the NFL’s worst running game. However, Bucs fans know this year’s team has a habit of making quarterbacks look a lot better than they are, so Joe is expecting an actual football game Sunday, not what was seen against the Giants 10 days ago. Mayfield had his leg/Achilles are stomped on Sunday but he’s ready to play. Mayfield made that clear today and Todd Bowles said Mayfield would have been a full participant in practice — if the team had a real practice on this beautiful fall day. The update on Mayfield has soothed Joe. Mayfield and the Bucs’ running game are the main reasons Tampa Bay should make the playoffs and finish 10-7.|2024-12-04 16:24:00|170|8|5|Baker Mayfield|Mayfield vs. O'Connell in Sunday football showdown.|3|Concerns over injuries and performance mixed with optimism and fighting spirit.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""drdneastup"", ""post"": ""Just found out Bucs old ILB Kwon Alexander was signed to another teams practice quad.  know Alexander has suffered from injuries but why wasn\u2019t he even looked at.

So Tristan Wirfs returned Sunday after missing a game with a sprained knee, one that also had a bye week’s worth of extra time to heal. Wirfs played well. Head coach Todd Bowles even noted that he graded will internally yesterday on the Buccaneers Radio Network. But today Bowles didn’t sound like he was talking about a healthy player. Bowles praised Wirfs for being exceptionally tough and gutting through the game. What he didn’t say was that Wirfs feels great and is in fine shape. Bowles did say Wirfs is better “on one leg” than many left tackles on two. That’s a nice sound bite, but it didn’t make Joe feel great about Wirfs’ playing like All-Pro on Sunday against beastly edge rusher Maxx Crosby and the Raiders. Joe sure hopes the Bucs can not only make the playoffs but clinch a game early so Wirfs can get a Week 18 break like he did two seasons ago.|2024-12-04 13:29:00|168|19|3|Tristan Wirfs|Wirfs praised for toughness despite concerns about health and performance.|1|Mixed sentiment with concerns about injuries, defense, but also positive player comments.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""A Bucs Fan"", ""post"": ""Bucs played the worst defensive line in the NFL in carolina\u2026. he should have taken the week off to heal more."", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""4th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""1:43"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Tampabaybucfan"", ""post"": ""Clinch early would be nice but TBBF will be at that Saints game and doesn\u2019t want to watch Trask\u2019s first and last game as a Buc."", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""4th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""1:43"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""toopanca"", ""post"": ""Skule has played well enough recently that the smart play may be to play each in alternate drives.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/antoine-winfield-adam-thielen-and-the-non-catch/|Antoine Winfield, Adam Thielen And The Non-Catch|Very insightful stuff here from the Panthers with different looks at the Adam Thielen touchdown catch that wasn’t on Sunday.  The play was ruled incomplete and it appeared game officials didn’t have all available replay angles to make a fully-educated assessment on review. However, Thielen was mic’d up for the game and NFL Films had a bunch of cameras following him, angles not seen on TV. But they are seen in the Mic’d Up segment at the Panthers’ official website, where Joe sees Thielen’s right hand came off the ball has he hit the ground to make the catch. Also seen is Thielen putting his right hand back on the ball — out of bounds — in an effort to secure it through the catch. There’s no way that incomlete call would have/should have been overturned. Most interesting to Joe was hearing Thielen getting that exact explanation from a referee in real-time. It sure would have been nice to hear that on th FOX broadcast. Also interesting for Joe was getting a better look at Antoine Winfield, Jr. in position to make a play but not making it. Winfield isn’t the same player this season. His Week-1-injured foot allegedly is 100 percent healthy but Joe wouldn’t bet on it.|2024-12-04 11:47:00|209|32|8|Antoine Winfield and Adam Thielen|Thielen's non-catch through unique angles.|6|Mixed sentiment with some frustration and disappointment but also acceptance and perspective.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""A Bucs Fan"", ""post"": ""Man that was a touchdown.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/odd-bucs-mental-toughness-definitions/|Odd Bucs “Mental Toughness” Definitions|Joe’s confused by what’s perceived as mental toughness at One Buc Palace. So in the first-half of the season, the Bucs did not lose a game with a messy finish against a hot-garbage team that stinks as bad as the Panthers, a club that dumped key players before the trade deadline and has all kinds of deficiencies and inexperience. It didn’t happen. That’s why Joe doesn’t get why Todd Bowles has been saying Sunday’s ugly win is one that wouldn’t have happened in the first half of the season. He’s been implying that Sunday’s win represents some sort of progress. Odd. Throw in what offensive line coach Kevin Carberry told the Buccaneers Radio Network last night, and Joe is wondering how mental toughness is actualy defined within the team. Carberry mentioned how happy he was for the players delivering big in key spots and he celebrated how proud he was of their “mental toughness” on the day. “Especially when in those critical moments, you know, when they needed to be at their best, when their best was required, it showed,” Carberry said. Sorry, but Joe didn’t see a mentally tough Bucs team on the field. Sure, the club overcame adversity at times, but what about 3rd-and-1 at the Carolina 2 yard line with the Bucs leading 17-16 with 3:15 remaining? A touchdown there with a 2-point conversion ends the game. Heck, simply a first down there — one freakin’ yard — forces Carolina into its final timeouts and the Bucs have a shot to bleed the clock way down. Instead, the Bucs ran for a 4 yard loss. What goes behind closed doors at One Buc Palace is unknown to Joe when it comes to how Todd Bowles addresss the team. Was Sunday’s overall mental toughness something to celebrate as as team? Joe isn’t buying it, especially with the dumb penalties and bad snaps, even though there were some spectacular individual efforts and the offensive line run largely blocked like animals — except on that game-on-the-line, third-down play.|2024-12-04 11:13:00|338|33|3|Odd Bucs|Confusion over mental toughness definitions in Bucs' recent performance.|2|Comments lean towards pessimistic outlook with criticisms towards the team's mental toughness and coaching decisions.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Dick LeBeau Jr."", ""post"": ""So you\u2019re talking about the same Panthers team that gave the Chiefs problems the week before?

The fourth-round pick started out as a part-time guy. He still hasn’t overtaken Rachaad White as RB1. But Irving has tranformed into one of the best running backs in the NFL. There’s no denying that. (Oh, Joe supposes one could deny that. But it would  frcome om the same crowd that walks out in public with a sign taped to their pants, “KICK ME!”) White apparently is the the Bucs’ go-to back in clutch situations. Look who was on the field on the final drive Sunday night getting the ball. It was White. Just from seeing how White and Irving interact, there doesn’t appear to be any animosity or nasty rivalry between them. Joe sees two dudes that hang together often. Joe knows that back in training camp, White took Irving under his wing and helped the Oregon product get up to speed on life in the NFL. Yesterday, White appeared on “Up and Adams” hosted by former NFL Network it-girl Kay Adams. He explained how he’s happy for Irving and that Irving makes White a better player. “We sit by each other on the plane,” White said of how he and Irving are tight. “I’m happy for him. You have to commend a guy coming into the league and doing his thing. Playing ball. Helping the team win. “It’s all love from me here. We both compete against each other. We both make each other better.” Adams believes Irving motivates White to have a higher standard because of Irving’s production. White didn’t disagree. Joe has been very harsh on White’s running because Joe thinks it is subpar. But yeah, White is a better runner this year (notice Joe didn’t say “good?”). If that’s because he feels threatened by Irving or is scared that he will have fewer touches, whatever. Players like to say how “iron sharpens iron.” That appears to be what is happening between two friends, Irving and White.|2024-12-04 09:00:00|346|25|7|Rachaad White|Rookie RB duo elevates each other's game through friendly competition.|6|Mixed feelings on White and Bucky, with some praising, some critiquing, and some neutral comments.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""BigPoppaBuc"", ""post"": ""Rachaad has made some really great plays this season.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/nfl-com-final-five-weeks-big-for-todd-bowles/|NFL.com: Final Five Weeks Big For Todd Bowles|A lot of Bucs fans are banking on a wet-toilet-paper-soft schedule in the final five games will vault the Bucs to the playoffs and perhaps even an NFC South title. However, playing one of the worst teams in the NFL on Sunday and needing a miracle to pull a win out of the jaws of defeat ought to sober up even the most devout Bucs fan. Friend of Ira, Judy Battista of NFL.com, believes that soft schedule could very much work against Bucs coach Todd Bowles. Battista listed eight coaches that need to be looking over their shoulders in the final five weeks and she included Bowles. (Nowhere does Battista use the term “hot seat.”) Battista believes if Bowles and the Bucs get tripped up by one of these lesser teams and miss th playoffs, it may set the wheels in motion for action from Team Glazer. Battista also pointed out that a defensive-minded coach like Bowles having one of the league’s worst defenses is not a good look. Bowles is in his third season as the Bucs head coach, and they went to the playoffs in each of his first two seasons, winning a playoff game last season, the first since Tom Brady retired. In the weak NFC South, though, the Bucs have never won 10 games in a season under Bowles, and this season, with a cascade of injuries, the Bucs lost four in a row. They have also lost both games to the Falcons, and their defense, entering Week 13, had allowed, on average, the fourth-most overall yards and passing yards in the league. Still, Bowles has a chance to get the Bucs to the playoffs again, thanks to Atlanta’s inability to pull away in the division. An improved defense will be required. The unit got off to a good start following Tampa’s Week 11 bye by allowing just seven points to the Giants in Week 12, but on Sunday, the Bucs allowed Bryce Young to pilot a two-minute drive and take the lead for Carolina late in regulation. Then, in overtime, the D forced a turnover that led to Tampa’s winning field goal. The Bucs have a very manageable schedule, and they and the Falcons are both 6-6 atop the division. That game in Carolina fully shook Joe. Before that game, Joe was beginning to think the Bucs could take care of business, especially with the Dixie Chicks imploding. But that Carolina game, man, the Bucs had to fight their arses off just to barely, by the skin of their teeth, survive a truly trash team. How can Joe trust this team in any game if that’s the way the team came out to play with so much at stake? It wasn’t just the players going through the motions with no energy, save for a select few professionals, but the game also included truly baffling, head-scratching coaching moves like this and this sprinkled in.|2024-12-04 07:00:00|488|40|6|Todd Bowles|Bucs seek playoff spot amid rising concerns.|2|Mixed feelings about coaches, injuries impacting team, uncertainty about future performance and leadership.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Bucsfan"", ""post"": ""Time will tell , but do not believe for a second that Glazers will not look at Evans and Godwin injuries as partial justification for any resulting shortcoming."", ""post_time"": [""Bucsfan""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Beeej"", ""post"": ""I think Carolina and Dave turned the corner.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/bucky-irving-better-than-saquon-barkley/|Bucky Irving Better Than Saquon Barkley?|It almost seems sacrilegious to suggest that Bucs running back Bucky Irving is better than Eagles stud running back Saquon Barkley. But he may be. First, Irving has racked up his stats as a backup. That’s insane on face value. Second, Joe has already pointed out that Irving has more yards — well, a yard — than Barkley after getting hit behind or at the line of scrimmage. No matter how you slice it, the Bucs appear to have found a special player on the third day of the draft. Now the crowd over at The 33rd Team has a graphic showing through 13 weeks of games, Irving has a high percentage of runs that go for 10 or more yards. Some 13.8 percent of Irving’s carries have gone for 10 or more yards. For Barkley, 13.0 percent of his runs were for 10 or more yards. As for running backs thriving with this stat, Irving ranks sixth overall. Jahmyr Gibbs of the Lions has 17.8 percent of his runs go for 10 or more yards. The way the Bucs played, or didn’t play, in Carolina, it looks like two players will have to carry the Bucs to the playoffs: Mike Evans and Irving. |2024-12-04 03:45:00|204|31|8|Bucky Irving|Bucs RB potentially outperforming Eagles' Barkley based on stats.|5|Mixed opinions on Bucky's talent compared to Barkley, with some praising and others skeptical.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Ryan"", ""post"": ""Bucky is very good but lacks the elite breakaway speed that Saquon possesses.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/mike-edwards-may-miss-a-game/|Mike Edwards May Miss A Game|The returning Bucs championship safeties have had rotten luck in their second go-around with their old team. The Bucs won the Super Bowl for the 2020 season with safeties Jordan Whitehead and Mike Edwards playing critical roles. They returned this season and have been cursed by the injury bug. Whitehead, who hasn’t resembled the same guy who bolted for the Jets in 2022, suffered a pec injury against the Giants. He doesn’t need surgery (yet) and is on injured reserve. Whitehead will miss at least three more games before he is eligible to return. At best, Whitehead may play two games before the playoffs, if the Bucs make the playoffs. Last week the Bucs brought back Edwards, essentially to replace Whitehead. But he pulled a hamstring Sunday in Carolina. Per Jenna Laine of ESPN, Edwards may miss a game. Edwards suffered what is known as “Grade 1 hamstring strain,” per Laine. So on paper currently, he should be ready to play in Los Angeles against the Chargers. As a precaution, the Bucs also brought back two former safeties this week. Kaevon Merriweather, who played in 19 games the past two seasons with the Bucs but who was released recently, was plucked off the Lions practice squad. Also, the Bucs signed and placed on their practice squad fan favorite Ryan Neal, who started for the Bucs last season. Joe understands Neal’s return won’t make Bucs fans rest comfortably.|2024-12-04 00:00:00|237|23|3|Mike Edwards|Bucs safeties plagued by injuries|4|Mixed feelings about team performance, injuries, and coaching decisions.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""ModHairKen"", ""post"": ""Play Neal.
