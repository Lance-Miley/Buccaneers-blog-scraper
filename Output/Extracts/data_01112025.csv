https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/baker-mayfield-says-hes-thinking-time-of-possession/|Baker Mayfield Says He’s Thinking Time Of Possession|Do quarterbacks care about the opposing quarterback? One would think they’ve got enough to worry about trying to execute each snap successfully. However, Baker Mayfield admitted to NBC’s Devin McCourty this week that he’s got Jayden Daniels on the brain. Just a little. McCourty asked Mayfield about Daniels and whether their head-to-head aspect of their Sunday night matchup factors into his thinking. “You know, a little bit of thought goes into the time of possession, not trying letting him get into a rhythm too much,” Mayfield said, via NFL on NBC. “And so, that goes back to all of us being able to execute our run game and the most physical team’s going to win the game.” Mayfield is on point. Nothing would be sweeter than to have Daniels on the sideline watching the Bucs chew up the clock while he thinks about how critical his next possession is. The Bucs ranked No. 2 in the NFL this season in time of possession at 32 minutes and 7 seconds per game, which is rather stunning considering the Bucs’ soft zone defene. The Washington offense is middle of the pack. In Week 1, the Bucs won the time of possession battle with Washington by 7 1/2 minutes. Joe’s glad Mayfield is acutely aware that conservatively moving the chains tomorrow night will be in the Bucs’ interest more than usual.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/you-stop-one-guy-you-win-this-football-game/|“You Stop One Guy, You Win This Football Game.”|The Bucs have little to worry about on Sunday night if you believe the words of one Xs and Os guru who patrols the halls of One Buc Palace. Joe’s referring to Rondé Barber, the legendary Tampa Bay cornerback and his comments on WFLA.com. Barber sees the Commanders as a one-man band: rookie QB Jayden Daniels. “When you start looking at what the Bucs are going to have to do to win this football game, it’s literally stop one guy. So when you talk about favorable matchups, it’s that,” Barber said. He went on to talk about how most of Daniels’ rushing yardage is scrambling yardage versus designed runs, and scrambles can be contained more easily. “The reality is, you stop one guy, you win this football game,” Barber said. So how to stop Daniels? JoeBucsFan.com draft guru Sean Sullivan broke that down in a short podcast strictly devoted to containing the Commanders’ stud. One thing Sullivan harped on is the Bucs’ overloading their defense to make moving right difficult for Daniels. Joe thinks it’s too simplistic to say beating the Commanders is all about Daniels. While the Commandoes defense isn’t great, it’s a lot better than the defensive slappies the Bucs just faced against New Orleans (and struggled with) and Carolina. Joe thinks the Bucs will need a true “A” game from their offensive line to win, perhaps even more than containing Daniels.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/the-todd-bowles-nonsense/|The Todd Bowles Nonsense|Joe continues to hear chatter on sports radio, YouTube and social media about how Todd Bowles could get fired if the Bucs lose on Sunday. It’s nonsense. It’s about as likely as Joe Tryon-Shoyinka having a three-sack day or Joe being invited to the cheerleaders’ 1 a.m. postgame hot tub party tomorrow night. In other words, it would take an act of God, as they say in the insurance business. Bowles won 10 games and a division title this season with a new offensive coordinator and significant injuries (there’s a reason Chris Godwin earns $20 million per year) and his team was still strapped by Tom Brady-era salary cap spending. But more important, the Bucs organization is in love with the culture Bowles has established. There’s tremendous unity — win or lose. Back in July, Buccaneers Ring of Honor general manager Jason Licht went out of his way to say players are hungry to play for Bowles, and that the 2024 Bucs are the most unified Tampa Bay team in over a decade, Licht added. “We owe that to the culture that’s been built by Todd Bowles,” Licht said. “This is a coach that these guys love to play for. They love to re-sign here and come back for. “They don’t want to leave and, you know, the head coach drives the culture. And we have an outstanding culture. I can’t think of a better time that we’ve had since I’ve been here, this is going on Year 11, where the locker room is more closely knit than it is right now. You know that started with [Bruce Arians] but now a big factor of that is Todd keeping it going and making it even closer.” After Licht’s comments, Joe followed up with Lavonte David, and he agreed that the 2024 group is the tightest he’s been around. Licht also doubled down on his comments a week or two later. So why exactly would the Bucs want to launch Bowles? The Bucs feel like a team a year away from being a No. 2 seed in the playoffs. Anyone really think the culture to which Licht spoke has eroded? Joe thinks it’s very fair to question whether Bowles has what it takes to win a Super Bowl. But that doesn’t translate into firing the guy and imploding the culture on a hope you might hire someone who is prepared to win immediately. Bowles deserves another season and Joe — and Ira Kaufman — are sure he’s already got one. If you want to pretend Bowles could be out of a job on Monday, Joe won’t criticize you. But it’s based on nothing more than fantasy.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/antoine-winfield-and-game-readiness/|Antoine Winfield And Game Readiness|Interesting wording from Bucs icon and Hall of Fame cornerback Rondé Barber. So Bucs star safety (former star?) Antoine Winfield Jr. messed up his knee and missed the past four games. One month ago today, Buccaneers general manager Jason Licht said it was a big loss and maybe Winfield could return in the regular season. Well, Winfield didn’t make it back, even for the Bucs’ must-win game last Sunday. But was he healthy enough to play? Joe woudn’t have questioned anything until hearing Barber today, an ultimate Bucs insider who attends practice. “Personally, I know what Winfield did. He had a mild sprain of his MCL,” Barber said on WFLA.com. “I thought actually that he was going to be able to play sooner, but apparently he just couldn’t get right with it. Right? It just didn’t feel right and he wanted to take his time.” The “he wanted to take his time” phrasing from Barber surprised Joe, especially considering Barber played 15 consecutive seasons as a defensive back without missing a game. Most players don’t want to take their time if they can push through an injury. An MCL sprain is often the kind of injury that costs a player two weeks. Joe is not wagging a finger at Winfield, but it’s so rare to hear talk of a player wanting “to take his time” with an injury, Joe couldn’t ignore it. Barber went on to say Winfield is the X-factor and biggest game wrecker in the Bucs defense, if he’s close to 100 percent. Some of the Bucs’ defensive struggles have been tied to Winfield missing eight games this season, Barber added. Joe hopes Winfield is at 90 percent or better.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/spies-dont-always-work-on-jayden-daniels/|Spies Don’t Always Work On Jayden Daniels|When Joe thinks of how an insanely good Bucs defense stopped a very mobile quarterback with a spy, Joe always goes back to 2002 when the Bucs hosted the Dixie Chicks and Michael Vick. This was at the height of Vick’s dangerous powers. So when the Dixie Chicks came into Tampa, then-Bucs defensive coordinator Monte Kiffin played a wild card. Kiffin ordered Derrick Brooks, also at the zenith of his career, to spy Vick. Brooks tormented Vick all day long as the Bucs crushed the Dixie Chicks. Vick was mic’ed up for the game and was heard complaining to a teammate that he couldn’t run away from Brooks, who more than once ran Vick down from behind. Earlier this week, Bucs defensive line coach Kacy Rodgers was asked about using a spy on Commandos quarterback Jayden Daniels. Rodgers said he’s watched tape of some of Washington’s games where a spy didn’t work on Daniels. So he said you have to play chess, and pick your spots to use a spy. Rodgers seemed reluctant to use a spy because, he said, that’s one less guy rushing or one less guy in coverage. Depending on the play, that could blow up in the Bucs’ faces. “Pick your poison,” Rodgers said of choosing when to spy Daniels. “You’re saying right now with the spy, hopefully we can keep him in the pocket but I’ve seen a lot of people spy and he made them miss so that didn’t exactly work out. “But if you’re staying here, now you’re putting a lot of pressure on the back end because the spy really isn’t rushing so you’re in three-man rush and the routes have more time to develop and get downfield. “So it still goes back to that chess match. You’re kind of like, ‘Hey, maybe this time will be good to spy. Maybe not so much the next time.’” In other words, Todd Bowles will be making educated guesses. It seems this year’s Bucs have been burned much more by pocket quarterbacks than runaround quarterbacks, though Lamar Jackson hurt the Bucs badly with limited scrambling. So maybe Rodgers and the Bucs will try to flood the backfield with bodies and hope Daniels screws up throwing on the run?|2025-01-11 10:40:00|374|23|4|Jayden Daniels|Bucs strategize using spy against Commandos quarterback Jayden Daniels.|3|Mixed sentiments with varying views on game strategies and player abilities.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Lightningvinny"", ""post"": ""Best way to contain him is to run the ball 40 times and keep him off the field,,,  otherwise put JTS on him ,,  JTS running all over the place like a chicken w his head cut off seems to be his  best trait"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""11th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""11:11"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Idroolpewter&red"", ""post"": ""I remember watching that 2002 game.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/baker-mayfield-is-one-of-us/|Baker Mayfield Is One Of Us|Could this be why Baker Mayfield has won over Bucs fans? Well clearly, winning helps. If the Bucs were losing, fans would want to run him out of town. Look how much fun it was with America’s Quarterback, Pro Bowler Jameis Winston. Every pass had fans on the edge their seats. Drama! Suspense! Intrigue! FUN! Every time Jameis went back to pass it was either going to be a helluva pass or a nut-kicking pick. But no one was bored. Alas, about 70 percent of Bucs fans helped chase him from Tampa Bay because… the Bucs were losing. Of course, Tom Brady coming to town sealed the deal (and a Super Bowl, baby). So yeah, Mayfield winning and playing really good ball is a major reason why Bucs fans have embraced him. But Mina Kimes and Ben Solak of BSPN believe it’s something deeper. They think fans see themselves in Mayfield. Kimes joked that she enjoys watching Mayfield because he plays like he thinks he’s Lamar Jackson. Mayfield, Solak noted, plays ball the way we would play ball in the backyard or an empty lot. “Baker plays football like an eight-year old would play football,” Solak said. “And that’s why we love him so much. Because when we were all eight-year olds, we were all going to be quarterbacks. “He is an absolute joy to watch play the game.” Joe doesn’t think Mayfield intentionally tries to play like a grade school kid. But his hustle and drive and enthusiasm — moxie! — sure rub off on teammates. And really, part of Mayfield’s everyman charm is he really is a regular guy. He hangs at regular guy watering holes. He sits with regular people at Rays games and pounds beers like a regular guy when he could easily get away from the riffraff and sit in a suite.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/liam-coen-discusses-how-bucs-offense-has-evolved/|Liam Coen Discusses How Bucs Offense Has Evolved|The past few days, the old cliché about running in the playoffs leads to playoff wins was spoken quite a bit. Bucs coach Todd Bowles was on that bandwagon yesterday. Thursday, Bucs offensive coordinator Liam Coen suggested that the offense evolved and helped lead the team to the playoffs because the Bucs became really good at running the ball. “You look at how we’ve adapted,” Coen began. “We’ve gotten better in the run game. When it really, truly matters is now: in [January], when we’ve got to run the football, when you’ve got to stop the run and all of those things. “Can you do it versus meaningful opponents in a playoff atmosphere? Can you go run the ball the way you’re supposed to and the way we want to? That’s got to be a key to success for us in this [Washington] game, for sure.” Joe thinks the Bucs can run the ball on successful teams. A lot of folks mock the Bucs for feasting on a cake schedule after the bye with only one winning team. OK, Joe gets it. But that one winning team the Bucs beat (on the road) is playing this afternoon in the playoffs, the Chargers. And the Chargers have a good defense. The Bucs ran all over their arses so much the Chargers had Bucky Irving’s cleat marks all over their faces and backsides. The problem with the Bucs is Joe doesn’t know which team will show up from week to week. Will it be the team that beat Detroit, Philadelphia, Los Angeles and took the Chiefs to overtime on the road, or will it be the team that gagged to Dallas and Atlanta (both on the road) and had to huff and puff their way to a division title-clinching win over the slimy Saints late?|2025-01-11 08:00:00|303|22|7|Liam Coen|Bucs offense evolving with strong running game for playoffs.|4|Mixed sentiments towards defense performance with concerns and hopes for improvement.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Lt.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/365402/|Plans Against The Bucs, Marshon Lattimore And Mike Tyson|You have to have a plan, says a BSPN X’s and O’s guy. The Bucs are the favored team Sunday night, currently giving three points to the Commandos as of midnight on Hard Rock Bet. So Chicago area high school football coach Matt Bowen hatched a plan for the Commandos to upset the Bucs. And that plan is: develop a plan to stop Mike Evans. Well, “scheme” is a two-way street. The defense isn’t the only side of the football that can come up with schemes. Look, Liam Coen is a sharp guy. The Bucs offensive coordinator knows defenses always try to stop Evans. That’s just common sense. And Joe also has confidence Coen knows the Commandos will try to get Marshon Lattimore on Evans as much as possible. Therefore, Joe thinks Coen will be able to scheme up ways to get Evans the ball away from Lattimore. As for the Commandos developing a plan to stop Evans, well, Joe will quote the great Iron Mike Tyson. “Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the mouth.”|2025-01-11 00:00:00|178|33|6|Plans Against The Bucs|Develop strategies to counter Mike Evans and Marshon Lattimore.|6|Fans express mixed feelings about team strategy and performance concerns, both optimistic and pessimistic.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""BucsFanSince1996"", ""post"": ""We won games earlier in the season without Evans so even if they were to double team Evans and successfully take him out it won\u2019t stop the Bucs from scoring 30+ points.
