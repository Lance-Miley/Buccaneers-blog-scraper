https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/mike-greenberg-is-staying-in-tampa/|Mike Greenberg Is Staying In Tampa|Remember when Buccaneers Ring of Honor general manager Jason Licht called Mike Greenberg “the real GM?” That was four years ago. Greenberg, the assistant Bucs GM, was director of football operations back then and respected league-wide for his salary cap wizardry. Since then, Greenberg’s profile has grown and he was a target for the vacant Jets GM job this year and then Jacksonville came calling over the weekend for their general manager position. Per Joe’s sources, Greenberg accepted the call and was asked to set up another short call this week prior to a formal interview. After some thought, Greenberg told Jacksonville — with an extremely appreciative and gracious thanks but no thanks — he’s staying with the Bucs. Greenberg isn’t passing on future GM opportunities, Joe was told, his motivations comes out of loving his role with the Bucs and their exceptional culture. And Greenberg felt a loyalty pull to stay with Licht and Team Glazer. Simply put, Greenberg didn’t want to go down the Jaguars path and it has nothing do with their new head coach, Liam “El Serpiente” Coen. Strong day for Bucs fans. And Joe applauds Greenberg’s decision. It would have been a challenging transition for Licht to lose his two closest go-to guys in one offseason. New Raiders GM John Spytek just left the assistant GM role in Tampa. Joe hopes Greenberg’s next move to sell his comrades on the value of trading for Myles Garrett.|2025-02-04 18:30:00|241|40|7|Mike Greenberg|Greenberg turns down GM job offers to stay with Buccaneers.|8|Mixed reactions with a leaning towards optimism and loyalty.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""JimBobBuc"", ""post"": ""Joe, for the illerati like me, please tell us the roles that Spytek and Greenberg had?"", ""post_time"": [""February"", ""4th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""7:11"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""RuKa_44"", ""post"": ""Great breaking news Joe!!

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/sportsbook-has-bucs-as-huge-longshot-for-myles-garrett/|Sportsbook Has Bucs As Huge Longshot For Myles Garrett|The betting world is filled with non-believers when it comes to the Bucs acting like a team “this close” to winning a Super Bowl and chasing one of the game’s greatest players. Beastly Browns All-Pro pass rusher Myles Garrett has demanded a trade (doing Browns management a massive public relations favor) because he wants to get to a Super Bowl soon, so he claims. If one presumes the AFC North-dwelling Browns don’t want to see their popular star dealt within their conference, then it’s easy to consider the edge-rush needy Bucs as a legitimate possible destination. The Bucs have built a lasting contender and have — or can create — the salary cap room. However, per an NBC Sports graphic released today (below), the Bucs are a betting longshot to be Garrett’s next team. Joe has listened to many national pundits talk about Garrett’s next team and the Bucs haven’t come up. Not even Bucs fan Father Dungy, the Hall of Fame head coach, named the Bucs on his NBC podcast. Joe keeps hearing the Falcons, Lions and Commanders as teams that would go all-in for Garrett, and that the price likely will be two first-round picks. NFL Network draft guru Daniel Jeremiah, the former Browns scout who is well connected with NFL general managers, offered intriguing takes on situation via The Rich Eisen Show yesterday. He noted a true contender, a team selecting the back half of the draft, would likely have to cough up two first-round picks and a little bit more to score Garrett. Jeremiah also talked about how the Browns should be interested in 2026 draft capital to score their franchise quarterback of the future. Joe’s all in favor of the Bucs making a run at a Garrett trade but doesn’t expect it from Buccaneers Ring of Honor general manager Jason Licht. And few else seem to expect it, either. |2025-02-04 16:00:00|314|43|4|Myles Garrett|Bucs potential trade for Garrett doubted by experts.|3|Mixed opinions on trading for Garrett, with concerns about cost and fit.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""SteveK"", ""post"": ""We need to make the best offer for Garrett.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/gerald-mccoy-talks-lavonte-david-status-bucs-greatest-need/|Gerald McCoy Talks Lavonte David Status, Bucs’ Greatest Need|Six-time Bucs Pro Bowl defensive tackle Gerald McCoy continued his impassioned plea for Buccaneers Ring of Honor GM Jason Licht to trade for Browns edge rusher Myles Garrett. McCoy also addressed the Bucs’ greatest offseason need. “You can either go corner or edge rusher [as greatest offseason need], but our four leading guys in sacks were three inside interior rushers and Lavonte [David]. And you gotta have somebody who can go win a 1-on-1 on the edge,” McCoy told The Drive on WDAE radio. McCoy further emphasized the Bucs’ edge rush need through the re-arrival of Bucs sacks king Shaq Barrett in late December. “If the Bucs had what they needed, they wouldn’t have went and got [Shaq] at the end of the year going into the playoffs. … This is not a shot at the guys we have, it’s just reality,” McCoy said. Garrett is a true “franchise-changer,” McCoy added, and he also shared a personal Garrett story. McCoy said Cleveland was interested him in 2019 free agency but Garrett told Browns management he didn’t want the Bucs’ castoff. Per McCoy, that wasn’t disrespect, it was evidence of how loyal Garrett is to teammates. And McCoy wants that kind of guy on his beloved Bucs. Another Garrett benefit? Joe will let McCoy answer. “Tampa, I have a direct line to Lavonte David,” McCoy said. “I spoke to Lavonte [Sunday]. Evrybody’s wondering if one of the greatest Bucs, one of the greatest players to ever grade NFL fields is coming back to finish his career in Tampa. I don’t have the answer for you. But if they get Myles Garrett, don’t you think that would entice Lavonte David to come back and be a Buccaneer? That’s all I’m saying.” Coaxing David into another season (if he even needs the nudge) is no reason to trade a ransom for Garrett. But Joe would love to see Garrett in a Bucs uniform and David could be a sweet side benefit. The X-factor is Garrett’s market value. If he costs two first-round picks, Chris Braswell and a conditional draft pick based on performance, Joe would start drooling.|2025-02-04 14:12:00|354|26|'5|Gerald McCoy|McCoy pushes for edge rusher Myles Garrett to Buccaneers.'|3|Mixed opinions on trading for Garrett - concerns about price, fit, and team resources.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Cobraboy"", ""post"": ""Garrett is an expensive pipe dream."", ""post_time"": [""February"", ""4th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""2:20"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""ElioT"", ""post"": ""No it wouldn\u2019t Cobraboy.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/an-eighth-ring-for-justin-watson/|An Eighth Ring For Justin Watson?|Yeah, a unique Bucs-related feel-good story still can move Joe in the dusty, beer-stained corners of JoeBucsFan.com world headquarters.  So back in 2018, the Bucs drafted a freakishly athletic receiver in Round 5 out of the University of Pennsylvania, Justin Watson. He was very strong rookie on special teams as he tried to find a few snaps on offense. A year later, after the failing Dirk Koetter regime was ousted, Bucco Bruce Arians hung on to Watson and he got a little action. Watson was on the Bucs’ Super Bowl team a year later and then got ex-communicated from Tampa in 2021; his disappearance happened after he ran a bad route that led to a Tom Brady pick-6. Watson has spent the past three seasons in Kansas City making 20-plus starts with Patrick Mahomes. So Watson has three Super Bowl rings and is gunning for a fourth Sunday against the Eagles. But it doesn’t stop there. Watson, also known as a Bill Currie Ford customer and friend of JoeBucsFan.com draft guru Sean Sullivan, is a favorite sun of the greater Pittsburgh area. ABC-TV in Pittsburgh ran a feature this moth on Watson that noted he also won two state titles in high school and two Ivy League championships at Penn. They even shared pictures of his rings. That’s one hell of a run for a 28 year old.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/status-quo-orders-to-josh-grizzard/|Status Quo Orders To Josh Grizzard|A guy who knows Todd Bowles well says the head coach won’t be giving his new offensive coordinator endless rope. Former Jets personnel chief and linebackers coach Pat Kirwan is the big SiriusXM NFL Radio afternoon voice and he often hosts the Buccaneers’ head coach during the season. Joe’s even seen Kirwan and Bowles talking off air at big NFL events. So Joe was interested to hear Kirwan’s take on the Bucs promoting Josh Grizzard to offensive coordinator after the recent departure of “El Serpiente,” Liam Coen, to Jacksonville. Kirwan acknowledged how Baker Mayfield has been unfazed by playcaller changes but he emphasized that Bowles will “make sure” Grizzard doesn’t try to exert his ego and make the Bucs’ system more challenging. Per Kirwan, Grizzard won’t get a green light to be “jumping up and down and inventing new stuff and new languages.” Coordinators can be lazy, Kirwan noted, and prefer their own playbook language to what players are most comfortable with. Obviously, Grizzard was with the Bucs last season as passing game coordinator/third-down guru, but that doesn’t mean Grizzard is lacking his own ideas and a desire to bring elements from his many years under three head coaches with the Dolphins. Kirwan’s point was that Bowles will draw a line in the sand with Grizzard; do your thing but keep it within the scope of what led the Bucs to 29.5 points per game last season. It’s an interesting take by Kirwan as Bowles has said many times over the years that he gives nearly complete freedom to his offensive coordinators.|2025-02-04 11:06:00|262|20|5|Josh Grizzard|Kirwan discusses limitations on new Bucs offensive coordinator.|5|Mixed sentiments on expectations for offensive changes under new leadership for the Bucs.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""FilthyAnimal"", ""post"": ""If it ain\u2019t broke\u2026"", ""post_time"": [""February"", ""4th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""11:17"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Kgh4life"", ""post"": ""I hope Grizzard do put his own spin on the offense.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/todd-bowles-great-gift-tampa/|Todd Bowles’ Greatest Gift|Most Bucs fans are not Todd Bowles fans. So Joe’s often wondered what it will take for those fans to flip in Bowles’ direction or at least temporarily forget their distate for the head coach. Joe finds the Bowles rage somewhat unique on the NFL scale. Few coaches have been reviled like Bowles after winning three consecutive division titles. Even the most hateful Bucs fans can admit that’s a rare NFL dynamic. Yesterday, after All-World edge rusher Myles Garrett made it public that he wants to play for a contender and requested a trade from Cleveland, “this Joe” thought the excitement of the Bucs making that deal might be enough to cool the Bowles fire. Bucs fans instantly would be so over-the-top focused on being a 2025 Super Bowl contender, and even the most cynical would recognize that Bowles and Garrett are a good fit. Maybe that would be enough to unite fans like it’s 2021 again? If Garrett is an honest man, Tampa should be on his list of destinations. Garrett would be a straight up fraud if he wasn’t interested in a Bucs team that’s won four consecutive division titles and has Vita Vea and Calijah Kancey on the roster. Anyone think Lavonte David sits out the season if the Bucs trade for Garrett? Yes, Joe thinks the Bucs want Garrett. He matches a need and has a below-market-value contract with two more seasons remaining on a five-year deal. The problem is nearly every contender will want Garrett. SI.com national NFL insider Albert Breer told The Rich Eisen Show yesterday he could see the Texans, Rams, Commanders, Eagles and Lions moving on Garrett. And Breer noted how he could talk himself into a large handful of teams. Sadly, the Bucs will have massive competition. (Yes, the Texans. Breer said Houston could include their beastly edge rusher Danielle Hunter in a trade.) But the Bucs have assets to deal, quality talent and picks, if they want to get serious. And that includes a potential three-way trade. Would their be crying the streets of Tampa if somehow Antoine Winfield, Jr. was part of a deal? A hidden benefit to Garrett, outside of the huge sacks totals and production, is he rarely comes off the field. Warriors like that in the Maxx Crosby, Brian Burns and Jason Pierre-Paul mode are extremely hard to find. What a gift he would be to Todd Bowles. Do the Bucs love Bowles enough to make a good offer?|2025-02-04 10:26:00|413|42|4|Todd Bowles|Bucs fans debate coach amid trade excitement.|3|Fans express mixed sentiment, skeptical of potential trade and critical of coaching staff.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Viktor Vaughn"", ""post"": ""I think myself and many bucs fans would love to see this, it is unlikely but who knows!"", ""post_time"": [""February"", ""4th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""10:30"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""David"", ""post"": ""No reason they should not be a Super Bowl contender this year "", ""post_time"": [""February"", ""4th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""10:31"", ""am""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""David"", ""post"": ""Winfield???

The offense is good. Unless Josh Grizzard is Byron Leftwich reincarnate, there is no evidence the Bucs won’t be able to run the ball, won’t be able to pass and won’t be able to block for Baker Mayfield. If the rookies take a step up and don’t play like rookies, the offense could be improve from its damn good average of 29.5 points per gam. Center Graham Barton needs to make better snaps — he looked at times like a guy who hadn’t played center in three years. Jalen McMillan vanished for much of the season but he was hot as a firecracker in the closing weeks, the games that meant the most. Bucky Irving? He didn’t play like a rookie so Joe is stoked to see his second year. You have to figure the pass defense will be better. It can’t get much worse. So Joe hopes Bucs coach Todd Bowles makes strides there. So yeah, Joe is bullish for the fall.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/gerald-mccoy-begs-jason-licht-to-go-get-myles-garrett/|Gerald McCoy Begs Jason Licht To Go Get Myles Garrett|The Bucs’ edge rushing isn’t ranked, it is just rank. The Bucs the past two years have had the fourth-worst pass defense in the league in terms of average yards allowed per game. The Bucs also have no edge rush to speak of. Coincidence? Joe doesn’t believe in coincidences when it comes to football. Everyone can see this. You can. Joe can. Even ex-Bucs stars can. And it seems one, former Bucs Pro Bowl defensive tackle Gerald McCoy, is either fed up or tired of biting his lip. Yesterday, GMC was on Jim Rome’s show. Rome asked him a question about superstar edge rusher Myles Garrett, who yesterday demanded a trade from the team that drafted him, the Browns. First, GMC told Rome had had to get something off his chest. He immediately fired off a message to Bucs AC/DC-loving general manager Jason Licht: Go get Garrett! “First thing first,” GMC said as he began to answer Rome’s question about Garrett. “Jason Licht, go do everything in your power to get this guy to Tampa.” And GMC then added that he doesn’t want to hear the Bucs say they cannot afford to trade a first round draft pick. GMC said that logic doesn’t hold up if you plan to play in a Super Bowl. “You know what, first round picks are 50/50 anyway,” GMC said. “Myles Garrett is 100 percent.” And Garrett isn’t just 100 percent, he’s 500 percent. The guy isn’t just good, he’s dominant. Maybe a Hall of Famer. Joe maintains to this day the greatest heist Licht ever pulled off was trading a third-round pick to New York for Jason Pierre-Paul. Garrett is way better than JPP, and JPP was damn good. You want to endear yourself to Bucs fans? You want to make (most) fans quit whining about Todd Bowles? You want Bucs fans fully energized and buying out available season tickets? Go get Garrett. Even though Joe is convinced Todd Bowles messes with edge rusher’s heads because he seems to believe an edge rusher covering Drake London is more important than sacks, look at what Bowles’ defense did when he had reliable edge rushers. Imagine how much better Garrett could make Vita Vea and Calijah Kancey, already dynamite studs. Think of how much better YaYa Diaby would be. And Joe is confident just having Garrett to lean on for advice and counsel would make YaYa that much better. Look at what Ndamukong Suh did for Will Gholston. Joe really doesn’t believe the Bucs will do any more than sniff around Cleveland. Once the Bucs smell the price tag, they’ll run away. But man, what a coup that would be if Licht found a way to get Garrett to Tampa Bay. GMC makes a helluva point. First round draft picks are a flip of the coin. Garrett is Simeon Rice. An absolute home run.  |2025-02-04 07:00:00|478|65|5|Gerald McCoy|Urging Buccaneers to trade for Myles Garrett for edge rush.|6|Mixed sentiments on trading for Myles Garrett, concerns about cost and fit, some optimism expressed.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Colonel Angus"", ""post"": ""Yes, to McCoy you listen to."", ""post_time"": [""February"", ""4th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""7:06"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""BuckyBuc"", ""post"": ""YES"", ""post_time"": [""February"", ""4th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""7:08"", ""am""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""ATrain"", ""post"": ""Mcsoftie has spoken!!!!

There, Goodell once again noted the international plan for the NFL, but it’s not locked in yet, is to play eight international games in 2025, and 16 games per year in the near future. Eight games means there will be 16 teams involved  — half the league. Thus, the Bucs have a coin flip of playing a game in a foreign land. Since the Bucs have marketing rights in Germany and have an investment in a Bucs-themed sports bar near Marienplatz in Munich, Joe is selfishly hoping the Bucs return to Munich. (Joe is still fully triggered that the Bucs bar has the gall to serve Killians when some of the best beer in the free world is brewed steps from this establishment. What were they thinking?) Regardless, Joe knows some Bucs fans will travel just about anywhere the team playss. So just in case, better make sure your passports are up to date.|2025-02-04 03:45:00|187|17|4|Bucs|NFL exploring playing in foreign soil in 2025.|6|Mixed sentiment with some excitement and frustration about international games and Goodell's role.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Steven #55"", ""post"": ""Anywhere in Europe Ill try to get a ticket and make a weekend of it!"", ""post_time"": [""February"", ""4th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""4:45"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Xristos"", ""post"": ""One of Bucs fans at least will be happy lol."", ""post_time"": [""February"", ""4th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""5:18"", ""am""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""Permanently Moderated"", ""post"": ""Fire Goodell!!!"", ""post_time"": [""February"", ""4th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""5:18"", ""am""]}, ""commenter3"": {""username"": ""FortMyersDave"", ""post"": ""The Bucs have always been the \u201chome\u201d team when the Bucs have gone to London or Munich, thus losing a home game at RJS.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/answer-to-bucs-edge-rush-woes-available-with-myles-garrett-demanding-trade/|Answer To Bucs’ Edge Rush Woes Available With Myles Garrett Demanding Trade|Hey, if Joe can dream about Rachel Watson and Lincoln Riley, why not maybe the best defensive player in the league. In case you are waking up from a multi-year slumber, the Bucs’ edge rush is a moon-crater-sized hole on a defense that has one of the worst pass defenses two years running. One way to significantly improve a pass rush is to have an edge rusher. The Bucs haven’t had one since Bucs sacks king Shaq Barrett and Jason Pierre-Paul were both healthy back in 2021. Yesterday, a potential answer to the Bucs’ edge rush woes emerged, and maybe the missing link in the Bucs making a real Super Bowl run. This answer is Myles Garrett. Arguably the best edge rusher in the game just told the Cleveland Browns he has had it. He wants to be on a team that can make a Super Bowl run. “Trade me,” Garrett told the Browns yesterday. So, the question is are the Bucs willing to listen? The question with Garrett in no way should be, “Can he cover Chris Olave?” Garrett hasn’t had less than 14 sacks in a season since 2020. Last year Yaya Diaby, Anthony Nelson and Joe Tryon-Shoyinka (three guys!) combined for 10.5 sacks. How could the Bucs not be interested in Garrett? Joe, unfortunately, doesn’t expect the Bucs to trade for Garrett. First, his salary is steep. He’s due to make some $20 million, per Spotrac.com. So right off the bat, the Bucs are going to say they have to sacrifice someone’s salary in order to fit Garrett under the cap. So who gets sacrificed to the pass rushing gods? Chris Godwin? Lavonte David? Jamel Dean? Joe would absolutely move heaven and earth to land Garrett, who will turn 30 in December. But Joe doesn’t believe the Bucs are anywhere near as motivated. Probably “disinclined” would be the operative word. Just like with Riley and Rachel, Joe can always dream.|2025-02-04 00:00:00|323|51|6|Myles Garrett|Bucs consider trading for standout edge rusher.|2|Mixed sentiment with skepticism about trading for Myles Garrett due to cost and fit concerns.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""BA\u2019s Red Pen"", ""post"": ""I commented on this here website weeks ago about trading for Miles Garrett because there were rumors about him wanting out of Cleveland and on the next podcast y\u2019all laughed it off and said they aren\u2019t trading him.
