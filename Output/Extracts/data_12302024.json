Doesn’t mean he isn’t passionate about winning, he’s just not a cartoon character on the sidelines.So when he gets visibly upset — a very rare occurrence — you can bet that whatever has ticked him off is big.After watching his defense pretend they were playing a game in a Pasco County high school flag football summer league and getting roasted like a hog on a tailgate grill, Bowles, in his customary halftime spot on the Buccaneers Radio Network, blurted, “DB’s have to get their heads out of their asses.”For Bowles, that was a Parcellsian explosion.Of course, the Bucs defense played significantly better in the second half yesterday, even without starting corner Jamel Dean who was hurt (again).Maybe thinking he has to get ahead of things for this Sunday’s game given the magnitude of the stakes — win and the Bucs are in the playoffs — Bowles already began harping on fundamentals in his day-after presser this afternoon.“They have to do the little things right,” Bowles said of what he expects in Sunday’s game against the slimy Saints. “They shouldn’t respond any other way than they responded yesterday.“We have to do the little things right. It’s a division opponent, we know it’s going to be a dogfight. We had to win one last year – last game of the season [at Carolina], it was 9-0. It was a dog fight with Carolina so we expect the same thing.”Well, the Bucs offense is a bit different than last year’s Stinking Panthers. The Bucs have a dominating run game. Last year there was nothing remotely dominating about it.And, as the age-old football saying goes, a run game will open up the pass game. And Baker Mayfield is a hot quarterback right now.", "post_time": "2024-12-30T20:05:59+00:00", "word_count": 315, "number_of_comments": 71, "article_sentiment_score": "5", "article_subject": "Todd Bowles", "article_summary": "Bowles motivates players for crucial game through tough love approach.", "responses": {"commenter0": {"username": "Matt_PcAfee", "post": "Joe any update on Pro Bowl voting?", "post_time": "December 30th, 2024 at 3:12 pm"}, "commenter1": {"username": "Upstate NY BUC", "post": "Just take the ball first Sunday, should be no prob!!!!

Collectively, Bucs fans could be heard screaming: “That’s been obvious for months, Coach!”No huge deal. Irving has 44 more carries than White this season, so Irving was getting plenty of action already. But Joe is glad the team formally has come around to hanging the bellcow on Irving.Consider how ESPN insider Jeff Darlington went on record with the Bucs’ new gameplan before yesterday’s game in his report from The Licht House.And then there was Buccaneers legend Mike Evans saying Irving was “the steal of the draft” after the game.Joe will agree with Evans, considering Irving was a fourth-round pick.Does Irving ever have a bad game? In addition to his 1,033 rushing yards on only 188 carries, Irving leads the NFL in catch percentage (45 of 47) and is averaging an impressive 8.8 yards per catch, which bests White’s strong season receiving last year.As Joe has noted, it appears the Buccaneers control the “Buckyneers.com” internet domain and are pointing it to their official website.If Irving can keep rolling, Team Glazer might have to consider going all-in and blowing out Buckyneers merch.Embrace all things Bucky.

Bad enough to get Bucs coach Todd Bowles mad.The Bucs’ pass defense in the first half was so wretched, Joe thought it was a flag football game.Pasco County high schools used to have a summer flag league for the schools’ football teams that Joe used to attend, and Joe swore that was what the Bucs defense looked like yesterday. Stinking Panthers receivers, specifically Adam Thielen, were running wild and free through the Bucs’ secondary.It was absolutely shameful! The duck could have guarded Carolina receivers just as well.It was right on par with watching the Bucs under Mike Smith try to guard Julio Jones with Ryan Smith.Bowles was so angry that on the Buccaneers Radio Network in his customary remarks heading to the locker room, Bowles said, “DB’s have to get their heads out of their asses.”Whoa! That was (and is) so out of character for Bowles. Man, he must have been about to erupt. Given the gravity of yesterday’s game, Joe understood the frustration.So here come the slimy Saints marching into The Licht House on Sunday in a win-and-in game for Tampa Bay. A win for the Bucs means the NFC South title and hosting a playoff game.And it seems the ailing Bucs defense, which saw cornerback Jamel Dean hurt (again), will get a break the way the slimy Saints offense is playing of late, documents Jeffri Chadiha of NFL.com.Given that the Saints have suffered three straight losses and scored a combined 29 points in those contests, it’s hard not to like Tampa Bay’s chances next Sunday.This is just what the Bucs need: An impotent passing offense for their shaky (to be polite) defense to slow down (forget stop).This ought to be a fun week leading up to Sunday’s win-and-in game. And Sunday should be loads of fun.Can’t wait!", "post_time": "2024-12-30T17:25:59+00:00", "word_count": 308, "number_of_comments": 26, "article_sentiment_score": "2", "article_subject": "Bucs Defense", "article_summary": "Hopeful outlook after challenging game for Bucs' defense.", "responses": {"commenter0": {"username": "Ds", "post": "Hilarious video lol I thought it was good come on nfl make a better camera for that kinda stuff", "post_time": "December 30th, 2024 at 12:30 pm"}, "commenter1": {"username": "Tye", "post": "All this NEED to play horrible offenses so the Bucs defense is not so exposed, NEEDING other teams to help the Bucs get into the playoffs to cover up have one of the absolute worse HC/DC is a perfect storm for the Bucs to get steam rolled in front of the nation in the 1st playoff game ……", "post_time": "December 30th, 2024 at 12:34 pm"}, "commenter2": {"username": "Leopold Stotch", "post": "Ngl Joe, I thought he made it too, until I saw it was in the paint and was like with a second… Then I saw the refs, took a deep breath.", "post_time": "December 30th, 2024 at 1:01 pm"}, "commenter3": {"username": "The Buc'n Waterboy", "post": "I needed to see that video today.

Fun game yesterday. But Joe senses Bucs fans couldn’t fully let loose with robust hilarity and emotion because they were on pins and needles over the Dixie Chicks game late last night. But everything turned out fine. So grab your mug of coffee and let’s roll!Win and InYes! The Commandos made Bucs fans sweat gallons of perspiration last night. Joe got a text from a hardcore Bucs fan who mocked the Dixie Chicks, typing “Good thing Atlanta’s defense is worse than the Bucs’.”With the score Atlanta 17, Washington 14 in the third quarter, Joe replied to the text, “Not bad enough.”Joe just wanted to barf when Kyle Pitts hung on to an absolute rope of a pass from Dixie Chicks rookie QB Michael Penix. (Who is laughing at Atlanta for drafting Penix now?).But one of the best clutch quarterbacks in the league, fellow rookie Jayden Daniels, once again pulled out a win in the final minutes or overtime.Next time Joe is in our nation’s capital, Daniels’ beers are on Joe’s tab.So what does this all mean? Very simple: Win and in.If the Bucs win Sunday against the slimy Saints (1 p.m. kickoff at The Licht House), Tampa Bay will win the NFC South and host a playoff game (again) two weeks from now in the wild card round.Yes, Joe has vivid, haunting memories of The Lost Decade, so while Joe was typing “again” in regards to hosting a playoff game, Joe had the shivers thinking about how surreal that would have sounded just five years ago.No need to muddy the waters or cloud the objective: Beat the slimy Saints and win the division. Joe doesn’t want to start thinking about the help the Bucs would need from the Panthers (!) in Atlanta if the Bucs cannot get the job done Sunday.Sadly, Bucs fans know too well what happens with this team after they curb-stomp an opponent, like they did crushing Carolina 48-14 yesterday.Beat the Lions; get your arse handed to you by the Broncos. Beat the Eagles, and choke against the Dixie Chicks. Kneecap the slimy Saints and then get MMA’ed by the Crows. Knock the socks off the Chargers and then look like dog manure against the Cowboys.While the goal is simple as can be and the Bucs will play a 5-11 team Sunday, Joe knows the Bucs’ pattern this season all too well.Regardless, should be a fun week leading up to the game.Stay Locked InYesterday, Joe spoke to several offensive players and found out something interesting. Joe’s observation of the first half when the Bucs scored all their first five possessions was the team played pissed off.It was almost as if Bucs offensive coordinator Liam Coen was ashamed how sloppy his offense was last week in Dallas. They came out flaccid rather than strong and the Bucs never recovered.Yesterday felt like Coen had been on his offense’s case all week and was pressing the pedal to the metal knowing the defense needed a break. And if the Bucs offense played to its potential, the Stinking Panthers couldn’t keep pace.That’s pretty much what happened. Tristan Wirfs admitted to Joe that Joe’s observation was credible. Other players said they had an intense focus and a rapt attention to detail on Sunday.Joe sure hopes that attitude sticks next week.January football is not the time to play uninspired football and not have an ironclad-like focus.Mike Evans, Baker Mayfield Within Striking Distance Of Records Future Hall of Fame receiver Mike Evans needs just 85 yards next week and he will have 1,000 yards receiving for 11 straight seasons, tying the great Jerry Rice’s all-time mark.It would have been a little less had the Bucs not accepted a penalty that wiped out an Evans catch for six yards.Evans also now ranks 21st all-time in total NFL touchdowns surpassing former Bucs receiver Tim Brown and Packers icon Don Hutson. Evans has 107 touchdowns.Also, Baker Mayfield is one touchdown pass away from 40 this season. Only one Bucs quarterback has thrown for 40 or more touchdowns. That would be Tom Brady in 2020 (40) and 2021 (43).The DuckJoe hopes whatever Bucs staffer carried the Bucs’ lucky duck off the field yesterday takes care of the thing and brings it back to The Licht House next week. The Bucs can use all the luck they can get on Sunday.The duck took on a life of its own in the stadium and even the players were playing along crediting the duck for luck.If someone is just waking up from an all-day snooze, Joe will set the scene.Midway through the third quarter the Stinking Panthers were back to punt. All of a sudden, both the CBS network feed and the Bucs’ JumboTron showed that a duck had circled and landed on the field of The Licht House and waddled up to Trey Palmer who was back to receive the punt.Palmer, Buccaneers Sideline Reporter T.J. Rives told Joe after the game, was startled by the duck. He kept looking to the Bucs’ bench thinking play would be halted or looking for advice so the poor thing wouldn’t get trampled.Instead, as if the football gods were protecting the duck like a guardian angel, Joe Tryon-Shoyinka (!) blocked the Johnny Hekker punt. The loose ball went straight to J.J. Russell who scooped and scored from 23 yards out to give the Bucs a 41-14 lead.The game was oh-vah!“I don’t even like ducks,” Bucs receiver Jalen McMillan said, noting the duck was taking attention away from Bucs players who deserved run.Why the disgust over the duck by JTS and McMillan? They played for Washington in college. Their hated rival is the Oregon Ducks. They probably even despise Daffy Duck.So the legend of the duck lives on. Hopefully, the duck got care and a lot of corn to munch on this week so it can make a grand reappearance at The Licht House, sort of like the Auburn eagle.Impressive Rookie ClassYou know it was a good day for the rookies when Chris Braswell came out of hiding to record a sack.But look at the rookies who had an impact just yesterday: Center Graham Barton was pretty much invisible outside of an early holding penalty, which means he did a helluva job. Didn’t even notice a bad snap.Tykee Smith has had a solid, not great, but solid year. The nickel back got burned once or twice but overall he’s a solid if not dangerous member of the Bucs’ secondary.Jalen McMillan had two touchdowns and was wide-ass open on both his touchdown catches. He has six touchdown catches in the past four games.Bucky Irving? What do you want Joe to say? He’s a beast. Even seventh-round (!) pick Devin Culp was making plays yesterday with three catches for 52 yards.That’s a helluva draft class. The lone rookie you didn’t see yesterday was Elijah Klein and you don’t want to see him. That would mean the Bucs have an injured offensive lineman.", "post_time": "2024-12-30T10:00:17+00:00", "word_count": 1158, "number_of_comments": 46, "article_sentiment_score": "7", "article_subject": "Five Things", "article_summary": "Excitement over Buccaneers' chances tempered by past disappointments.", "responses": {"commenter0": {"username": "MadMax", "post": "We were spying Penix….thats how we came across McMillan and Kulp…just shh…options are always open, Baker was our man, but what if he asked for too much….thats why you check, double check, triple check all options and what ifs…", "post_time": "December 30th, 2024 at 5:13 am"}, "commenter1": {"username": "MadMax", "post": "Culp…sorry", "post_time": "December 30th, 2024 at 5:15 am"}, "commenter2": {"username": "FortMyersDave", "post": "Great article Joe!

I’ll get results when I go back in.”So no light was shed. The CBS broadcast team said Dean injured both knees.As Joe walked into the Bucs’ locker room after the game, Dean was leaving. He was not on crutches, which is a good thing. But he was obviously limping. It almost looked to Joe that he may have needed crutches.Joe quickly asked Dean how he was doing and all he said was, “I’ll be fine” and headed out the door as quickly as his bum knee would allow. He smiled and seemed to be in a good mood.Masked emotions?Yesterday in place of Dean, cornerback Josh Hayes logged quite a few snaps. No, that’s not comforting.Bowles will have an update at his day-after presser shortly after noon on today. Injured players usually are still undergoing tests on Mondays, so it wouldn’t be surprising if Bowles has no news.", "post_time": "2024-12-30T05:55:38+00:00", "word_count": 214, "number_of_comments": 28, "article_sentiment_score": "2", "article_subject": "Jamel Dean", "article_summary": "Dean's knee injury status uncertain", "responses": {"commenter0": {"username": "Simeon4HOF", "post": "Almost forgot about this while watching wacky night game.\nHope Dean is OK.

It’s as simple as can be: Win Sunday, and the Bucs are in the playoffs.Should be fun.Thank you Dan Quinn and Jayden Daniels.", "post_time": "2024-12-30T04:44:40+00:00", "word_count": 133, "number_of_comments": 63, "article_sentiment_score": "8", "article_subject": "Bucs", "article_summary": "Buccanneers win and in playoffs with Sunday victory.", "responses": {"commenter0": {"username": "adam from ny", "post": "wow i sweated out that game like a fat man in a sauna", "post_time": "December 29th, 2024 at 11:45 pm"}, "commenter1": {"username": "Kayla", "post": "The Bucs are lucky ducks today!", "post_time": "December 29th, 2024 at 11:46 pm"}, "commenter2": {"username": "Chrisonthecape", "post": "Could Bowles possibly screw this up?", "post_time": "December 29th, 2024 at 11:47 pm"}, "commenter3": {"username": "Saskbucs", "post": "Beautiful.

They stomped Carolina, handing former offensive coordinator Dave Canales a stinging 48-14 setback, matching the franchise record for most points scored in a home game.It was a complete performance led by Baker Mayfield and an unstoppable offense that rolled up 33 first downs and 551 yards.Rookies Bucky Irving and Jalen McMillan took turns tormenting the visitors while Mike Evans caught a pair of short TD passes and closed in on another 1,000-yard season.Todd Bowles wasn’t happy with Adam Thielen’s 40-yard scoring reception that gave Carolina some hope in the final minute of the opening half, but Tampa Bay regrouped and blanked the Panthers 21-0 in the last two quarters.Payne Durham joined the fun with his first NFL TD catch and J.J. Russell dashed 23 yards for a score with a punt that was blocked by Joe Tryon-Shoyinka.Mayfield was spectacular, throwing five scoring passes and only five incompletions. He spread the wealth to nine different targets and Evans is now only 85 yards away from the 1,000-yard mark.McMillan has emerged as a serious threat with six TD catches in the last four weeks.\nAt 9-7, the Bucs are now guaranteed another winning season under Bowles, who has bigger accomplishments in mind.The rain held off until an hour after the game but Carolina’s defense, missing standout cornerback Jaycee Horn, was left high and dry as Tampa Bay converted 10-of-14 on third down and didn’t turn the ball over.Not even a wayward duck wandering the field could slow Tampa Bay’s momentum.Irving, now established as the No. 1 ball carrier, accounted for 190 yards from scrimmage, leaving a slew of would-be tacklers in his wake.The Bucs gained 337 yards in the first half alone, scoring once again on their opening possession. Mayfield’s protection was stout and the offensive line carved out massive holes in a 202-yard ground game.Bryce Young was sacked five times and Carolina’s run game went nowhere, averaging 3.0 yards. The only bright spot for the Panthers was Thielen, a crafty veteran who caught five passes for 110 yards and two scores.Here’s how the Bucs rewarded their fans with a dominating victory, giving them a 5-1 mark since the bye week and rebounding forcefully from the bitter loss at Dallas:* What a draft class for Jason Licht and his scouting staff. Irving, McMillan, Graham Barton and Tykee Smith have made significant contributions as rookies. The light has turned on for McMillan, who had only one TD catch in his first eight games. He has five receptions in each of his last three games and Liam Coen is doing a stellar scheme job, freeing McMillan up in space.* Tampa Bay’s rush defense is peaking at the right time. While the Buc run game is flourishing, opponents have been held under 100 yards on the ground for seven consecutive games. It helped Sunday when 1,195-yard rusher Chuba Hubbard was declared inactive with a calf strain.* Somebody needs to remind Trey Palmer that you don’t field a punt inside your 10-yard line. His questionable judgment could cost the Bucs a game.* Mayfield was at the top of his game from the start, making smart reads and getting everyone involved. With 39 TD passes on the season, Mayfield needs five against the Saints in Week 18 to top Tom Brady’s single-season franchise mark set in 2021.* You want big plays? Five of Tampa Bay’s 74 snaps gained at least 26 yards.* The Bucs have scored at least 30 points in half of their 16 games this season. That’s why Liam Coen will likely be the first name on my ballot next week when selecting the NFL’s Assistant Coach of the Year.* Evans surely wants to keep that 1,000-yard streak alive, but Mayfield REALLY wants to keep it going. Look for No. 13 to be targeted heavily in the early stages of Sunday’s matchup. “I’m looking forward to seeing what happens next week,” Mayfield said.* Speaking of 1,000 yards, Irving now has 1,033 yards on the ground. More importantly, he’s averaging a stunning 5.5 yards per carry. He seems to bust a big run every week and the Saints defense better hustle to the ball or Irving will wreck the game plan.* It takes a lot for Bowles to pull Mayfield from a game, but the time was right midway through the fourth quarter and the Bucs ahead by 34 points. Kyle Trask didn’t get to attempt a pass, but Mayfield avoided any chance of a late-game injury. Smart move.* Bowles has a chance to go 10-7 in his third season on the Tampa Bay sidelines. Given the array of injuries the Bucs have suffered and the 4-6 start, that would be no small achievement.\n", "post_time": "2024-12-30T00:00:10+00:00", "word_count": 810, "number_of_comments": 24, "article_sentiment_score": "9", "article_subject": "Ira Kaufman", "article_summary": "Bucs dominate Panthers in impressive victory.", "responses": {"commenter0": {"username": "Zzbucs", "post": "Ira, your last paragraph was spot on…….\nAgree 100%", "post_time": "December 29th, 2024 at 7:20 pm"}, "commenter1": {"username": "DavidBigBucsFan99", "post": "The negatives he’s done to lose us games over the last 3 seasons and the serious lack of higher tier coaching of the players far out weigh him keeping the ship righted thru the slew of injuries.
