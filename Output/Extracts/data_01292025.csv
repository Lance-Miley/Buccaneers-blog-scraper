https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/bucs-fans-will-be-on-the-edge-of-their-seats/|Bucs Fans Will Be On The Edge Of Their Seats|BY IRA KAUFMAN This Buc offseason is all about trying to gain an edge. Don’t be fooled by the numbers. Todd Bowles always finds a way to stack up impressive sack totals, but anyone who watched the 2024 Bucs knows this defense lacked a consistent pass rush. Although sacks tend to be drive killers, consistent pressure is what defensive coordinators strive for. Tampa Bay’s pressure was wildly inconsistent, whether the Bucs were chasing fleet quarterbacks like Lamar Jackson and Jayden Daniels or statues like Kirk Cousins and Jared Goff. The interior of the defensive line is stout, manned by Vita Vea and upcoming star Calijah Kancey. It was Kancey who led the Bucs with 7.5 sacks last season, two years after Vea posted a team-high 6.5 sacks. Still, it’s a lot easier to assign resources to block Kancey and Vea when opposing offensive line coaches aren’t concerned about the pocket collapsing from outside pressure. Why would they be? YaYa Diaby is young and promising, but last year proved he needs to raise his game. There will be changes. Say goodbye to Joe Tryon-Shoyinka. The Bucs could lose Anthony Nelson in free agency. If Will Gholston returns, it will be to provide run support on early downs. Shaq Barrett’s journey back to Tampa is a nice story, but let’s get real — he hasn’t offered much heat off the left side since 2021. Jason Licht has tried to land quarterback hunters off the edge in the draft, to no avail. He found Barrett in free agency and traded for Jason Pierre-Paul, two of the most astute moves by a Buc GM in decades. Together, JPP and Barrett chased Patrick Mahomes all over Raymond James Stadium en route to a Vince Lombardi Trophy. That was then. What’s the front office going to do now? You won’t hear Bowles publicly bemoan the absence of accomplished edge rushers on the current roster. That’s not the way he rolls. But you can bet Bowles, Licht and the Glazers are in firm agreement: finding an outside pass rush is Job 1 in the next three months. Picking at No. 19 in the first round, the Bucs could find slim pickings in a draft that lacks a Myles Garrett or a Will Anderson at the top. Penn State’s Abdul Carter is the consensus top edge rusher, but he’ll be long gone by the time Licht’s on the clock. Marshall’s Mike Green and James Pearce Jr. of Tennessee appear intriguing, along with Georgia teammates Jalon Walker and Mykel Williams and Texas A&M teammates Nic Scourton and Sherman Stewart. It’s a longshot to expect anyone except Carter to make a major impact as a rookie. So where does that leave the Bucs? There’s a former FSU standout who will likely be available in free agency, but Philadelphia’s Josh Sweat will attract plenty of suitors besides Tampa Bay. The Falcons, Patriots, Cardinals and Titans are some of the many teams also desperate for a dynamic edge rusher. Sweat’s no Garrett or T.J. Watt, but he has registered 25.5 sacks, 61 QB hits and 31 tackles for loss in the past three seasons. The Eagles gave Sweat a 3-year contract extension in 2021 and Buc fans have an opportunity to see him hunting Patrick Mahomes in the Super Bowl. The Eagles probably can’t afford to keep Sweat, who turns 28 in March. Licht is very tight with Philadelphia GM Howie Roseman, who drafted Sweat in 2018 and would likely offer Licht a candid assessment of Sweat’s character and work ethic. Khalil Mack, two years removed from a 17-sack season, is also a potential free agent, but he turns 34 next month and his play dropped off significantly with the Chargers in 2024. How about Hassan Reddick? No thank you. DeMarcus Lawrence? Pass. It’s up to the personnel department to find Bowles more tools for his defense. There are difference makers on that side of the ball … but not enough of ’em. |2025-01-29 20:03:00|661|38|6|Bucs Fans|Bucs offseason focused on enhancing edge rush for defense.|2|Pessimistic comments expressing frustration with team strategy, lack of confidence in personnel moves.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Saskbucs"", ""post"": ""Lawrence too old and injured I presume."", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""29th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""8:08"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Drunkinybor"", ""post"": ""Bowles philosophy on defensive ends is bizarre to say the least.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/josh-grizzard-and-jeff-jagodzinski/|Josh Grizzard And Jeff Jagodzinski|So once upon a time in 2009, when the Bucs were enduring excruciating growing pains, the team hired an offensive coordinator to call plays — except he literally couldn’t do it. Despite a strong resume, he was booted from the job during preseason, presumably for fraud and incompetance. Joe’s referring to Jeff Jagodzinski, who before landing in Tampa was the Boston College head coach and Packers tight ends coach and offensive coordinator. It was a mind-blowing situation. Jagodzinski needed help spitting out plays and was relying on subordinates to get him through preseason games. And Jagodzinski was no ancient politician clinging to office, he was 45 years old. Joe shares that dark piece of Bucs history as the team now interviews offensive coordinators who have never called plays. A candidate in that situation might be just fine, or maybe he’ll freeze or choke when the playclock turns on. Today, the Bucs intervewed in-house candidate Josh Grizzard, 34, for their vacant OC gig. He hasn’t been a playcaller but has been considered an offensive guru during his assistant coaching stops with the Dolphins and Bucs after graduating from Yale, where he largely was a junior varsity football player. Grizzard was lauded by departed Bucs offensive coordinator Liam Coen for his work developing third down packages and more. Grizzard lasted in Miami through head coaching regimes of Adam Gase, Brian Flores and Josh McDaniel. That’s a difficult accomplishment. Clearly, he’s commanded respect. But can Grizzard call plays and lead an entire offense? Joe can’t answer that.|2025-01-29 14:17:00|254|67|2|Josh Grizzard and Jeff Jagodzinski|Bucs' troubled history hiring offensive coordinators.|4|Responses are mixed with optimism and skepticism about potential OC hires and team direction.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""adam from ny"", ""post"": ""maybe he can make the offense sizzle and grizzle"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""29th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""2:21"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""adam from ny"", ""post"": ""please grizzle that burger a little more josh"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""29th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""2:22"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""Bucsfan"", ""post"": ""Hiring from within would be great as the offense would not change substantially."", ""post_time"": [""Bucsfan""]}, ""commenter3"": {""username"": ""Lt.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/attacking-the-weakest-link/|Attacking The Weakest Link|For Joe, there is no doubt where the Bucs’ biggest roster hole is. Yeah, one could argue cornerback. Joe’s at wit’s end with Jamel Dean. Unlike many, Joe is not anti-Dean. Joe thinks he’s a decent corner — when he’s on the field. And that’s the issue. He misses too much time, especially the biggest games (postseason). A guy could be Deion Sanders but if he can’t stay out of the tub, it doesn’t matter. Joe wouldn’t cry himself to sleep if the Bucs went safety in April’s draft. Joe really believes Bucs coaches have buyer’s remorse with Jordan Whitehead. No, for Joe, the biggest hole is easily inside linebacker. Right now the Bucs have J.J. Russell and that’s it. Other than that, you have a reclamation project like Deion Jones. That’s it. K.J. Britt is a free agent and who knows if Lavonte David will return or retire. This is why Jordan Reid of BSPN has his eye on an inside linebacker for the Bucs to draft. And that man would be Alabama inside linebacker Jihaad Campbell. Tampa Bay has been inconsistent at linebacker and needs youth in that position group, as longtime standout Lavonte David will turn 35 later this month. Alabama’s Jihaad Campbell is a young, ascending prospect who not only excels at the second level but can generate pressure with the pass rush on late downs. Also, as you can see in the video below (if the video doesn’t work click here) Campbell knows how to defend the pass, too. Every fan knows how rotten (again) the Bucs’ pass defense was and Todd Bowles requires everyone including towel boys to cover receivers downfield. Someone on Twitter yesterday was pimping Marshall edge rusher Mike Green, callng him a nice pickup. Joe sarcastically retweeted it asking, “Can this guy cover Drake London?” Only Bowles would sit a quality edge rusher because he couldn’t cover receivers like Darrelle Revis. And that’s why Joe would be happy to see the Bucs go inside linebacker at No. 19.  |2025-01-29 10:30:00|337|51|5|Joe|Bucs roster analysis: inside linebacker needs addressing.|3|Mixed sentiment with concerns about injuries, defense, and player capabilities.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Godlovesbucs"", ""post"": ""I think sirvocca Dennis is also going to be good, but def need more."", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""29th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""10:41"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""StormyInFL"", ""post"": ""Hopefully he is solid between the ears, too, unlike DW45."", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""29th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""10:43"", ""am""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""Buc4evr"", ""post"": ""I realize this guy is a ILB,  but a bigger concern is at OLB.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/report-bucs-qb-coach-thad-lewis-interviews-for-same-job-in-houston/|Report: Bucs QB Coach Thad Lewis Interviews For OC Job In Houston|So which in-house offensive coordinator candidate do the Bucs want to replace Liam Coen, if any? Well, at least one is garnering a lot of interest. NFL Network reported that Buccaneers quarterbacks coach Thad Lewis interviewed for the Texans’ vacantoffensive coordinator job and has had many offers from teams to interview. Lewis, after a long career as a backup NFL quarterback, was a Bucs intern in 2020 after working for Chip Kelly at UCLA. Bucco Bruce Arians became smitten and hired Lewis as an offensive assistant in 2021. He was Baker Mayfield’s quarterback coach in 2023 and 2024. A Duke graduate, Lewis must have been performing well in Tampa otherwise Mayfield and former Bucs playcaller Liam Coen wouldn’t have agreed to keep him for last season. And Joe knows the Bucs want a seamless transition at coordinator, so Lewis and fellow Bucs offensive assistant Josh Grizzard are names to watch.|2025-01-29 07:55:00|150|43|5|Thad Lewis|Bucs QB coach interviews for Houston OC job.|3|Mixed feelings about hiring Thad Lewis as OC, concerns about coaching staff and systemic issues.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Beeej"", ""post"": ""So, we like him for QB coach, but not OC?

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/kacy-rodgers-left-bucs-in-good-shape/|Kacy Rodgers Left Bucs In Good Shape|Joe knows every Bucs fan and their brother is still fixated on the Liam Coen saga and who the Bucs will choose to replace him. But Joe thinks not enough words have been focused on the departure of the lone Bucs defensive assistant who got quality results from his linemen. That would be Kacy Rodgers. The Bucs are in good shape up front with two first-round tackles in Vita Vea and Calijah Kancey. Both had really strong years. And as Bucs coach Todd Bowles said in his final presser for the 2024 season, don’t forget about Logan Hall. “They played well all year, and Logan [Hall] is included in that,” Bowles said about his starting down linemen. “I thought Logan had a heck of a year, as well. I thought the interior three did a heck of a job pushing the pocket all year long.” The past two years the Bucs have trained Hall to basically be the new Will Gholston. It’s been successful, Joe believes. Now Joe understands some fans may howl that a team should want more from the No. 33 overall pick than to be the next Gholston. Joe gets it. But for what Hall has been groomed to do, he had a solid season. Not a star, not flashy, but solid. Would Joe have loved to see Hall turned into to a quality edge rusher? Hell, yes. But it’s obvious that’s not a high priority. So Joe will embrace a guy doing what he’s been asked to do by his coaches.|2025-01-29 07:00:00|255|28|6|Kacy Rodgers|Rodgers' impact on Bucs defensive line acknowledged and praised.|5|Mixed feelings regarding coaches and player potential, with some frustration and hope expressed.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Lewi"", ""post"": ""Im glad he took took the leap, good for him"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""29th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""7:08"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Lewi"", ""post"": ""All that being said, I HATE zone coverage and hope we get some lock down man corners this offseason, IMO should be our main priority"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""29th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""7:11"", ""am""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""Outrigger"", ""post"": ""Don\u2019t hold your breath.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/cody-mauch/|Cody Mauch’s Improvement Helped Offensive Line Rise|One player Joe felt needed to pick things up for the 2024 season at times seemed overwhelmed in 2023. That would have been Bucs rookie guard Cody Mauch. Joe loved his heart and his attitude, but there were games where it seemed like Mauch was not on the same level as NFL defensive lineman. Joe had confidence that if Mauch had a full offseason in an NFL weight room to bulk up, he’d have a chance to improve. And that’s exactly what happened. Match that ornery attitude (between the lines — Mauch is actually a teddy bear off the field) with more bulk and you have a really solid player. In fact, Kevin Patra of NFL.com thinks Mauch was an under-the-radar stud. Offensive linemen generally don’t get enough praise when they improve. Mauch deserves it for making a MASSIVE leap from Year 1 to Year 2. As a rookie, the Buccaneers guard allowed 48 pressures and seven sacks. This season, those numbers dropped to 18 pressures and two sacks. He went from a near liability as a run and pass blocker to a reason why Baker Mayfield and the offense continued to click. Given that he was playing next to a rookie center in Graham Barton, Mauch’s rise is even more impressive. The Bucs offense as a whole improved in 2024 for a variety of reasons — Bucky Irving’s injection, Liam Coen’s play-calling, Mayfield’s continued improvement — but the offensive line’s bolstered play is up there. No one improved more than Mauch. That’s a great point Patra made about Mauch. He became a strong player despite playing next to a rookie center. Joe expects Graham Barton to be a better player next season (he has to work on those snaps) for the very same reasons Mauch was better: a combination of a full offseason in an NFL weight room and a year of NFL experience. Mauch was a big reason the Bucs offensive line became one of the better fronts in the game. Barton, if he mirrors Mauch’s jump, could make the line even better.|2025-01-29 03:45:00|345|16|8|Cody Mauch|Mauch's significant improvement from Year 1 to Year 2 praised.|5|Mixed sentiment with a range from optimism to criticism regarding various players and aspects of the team.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""bob in valrico"", ""post"": ""Good for Cody.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/bucs-may-hang-on-to-deion-jones/|Bucs May Hang On To Deion Jones|About eight years ago, Deion Jones looked to be the next big thing at linebacker playing for the team that drafted him, the Dixie Chicks. After the 2021 season, the Dixie Chicks washed their hands of him, despite him missing just 12 games in six seasons. That’s good durability. Since Atlanta parted ways with Jones, he’s bounced around the NFL. He played three games for the Bucs at the end of this season because the Bucs were desperate for warm bodies due to injuries. Though he didn’t start a game for the Bucs, Jones did have a pass defensed in the playoff loss to the Commandos. In his day-after presser following that game, Bowles said Jones may have earned another look-see for the 2025 season. And the Bucs did just that by giving him a futures contract earlier this month. “Small sample size, but we liked what we saw,” Bowles said. “He’s very athletic, he’s very good in the pass game. He tackled okay. He did some things well. “I’d like to see more of him, so we’ll see what the future holds but he’s a guy in hindsight that I’d like to have back.” Well, the Bucs need inside linebackers in the worst way. And if (God forbid) Lavonte David hangs it up, there is no doubt the biggest hole on the roster will be at inside linebacker. Bigger than the craters on Norv Turner’s face. Depending what David decides, Joe would not be shocked if the Bucs signed a free agent linebacker in March and followed that up by drafting an inside linebacker. It might be wise to focus on Alabama linebacker Jihaad Campbell.|2025-01-29 00:00:00|276|21|6|Deion Jones|Bucs may retain Jones for future seasons.|2|Negative comments and criticism dominate the responses.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""@Hands2theFace"", ""post"": ""Damn!
