The rest of the NFC representatives have came from the Western Division (San Francisco 2012, 2019, 2023; Seattle 2005, 2013, 2014; Los Angeles 2018, 2021; Arizona 2008) for a whopping 9 times. 3 teams Detroit, Minnesota and Washington are in these playoffs but have yet to represent the conference in the Super Bowl.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/cautious-optimism-for-cade-otton/|Cautious Optimism For Cade Otton?|Bucs coach Todd Bowles doesn’t like to talk about the status of injured players during his regularly-scheduled Wednesday news conference, party because he doesn’t know their status. Bowles doesn’t want to declare a player ready to play when he isn’t. Unless asked, Bowles doesn’t reveal any info on players who may or may not be injured. He waits for the injury report to be released or he waits until his next news conference, usually Fridays. Today, Bowles was asked about three injured starters. The Bucs had a walk-through but had the Bucs held a full practice, Bowles said safety Antoine Winfield (knee) would have been a full participant. Later, Bowles was asked about cornerback Jamel Dean (knee). Dean would have been limited if there was a practice, Bowles said, offering no further comment. Then Bowles was asked about tight end Cade Otton (knee). He was slightly optimistic. “Otton would have been limited but he’s trending the right way,” Bowles said. So it seems there’s a shot Otton plays against the Commandos on Sunday night. Just maybe. Joe thinks the offense really misses Otton, who easily was having his best season as an NFL tight end. When both Mike Evans and Chris Godwin were lost for three games together, it was Otton who stepped up big time to help fill the void. Otton hasn’t played since injuring his knee in the Bucs’ win over the Chargers on Dec. 15.|2025-01-08 17:07:00|238|18|7|Cade Otton|Cautious optimism for injured tight end's return to play.|4|Mixed sentiments regarding player availability and performance in upcoming games.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Mac"", ""post"": ""We need all hands on deck for the playoffs.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/nobody-really-knew-what-he-could-do/|“Nobody Really Knew What He Could Do”|So Joe watches Bucs training camp practices and while a lot of players are rather invisible, one guy who often looked the part of dangerous receiving tight end this summer was rookie seventh-round pick Devin Culp. And then he never played. Week after week, Culp was was a healthy scratch. In fact, before the Week 17 game against Carolina, Culp had three snaps under his belt on offense. Simply put, the Bucs didn’t trust him enough to play him. That changed, seemingly by necessity, when starting tight end Cade Otton went down last month with a knee injury. Culp had three catches for 52 yards against the Panthers and two catches for 36 yards Sunday, including a third-down catch that Joe called as season-saver kind of grab when it happened. Todd Bowles was candid about his soon-to-be 25 year old rookie on the Buccaneers Radio Network yesterday. “Nobody really knew what he could do,” Bowles said of Culp. “He’s a very athletic guy, very athletic tight end, waited his turn, he studied. He goes out, he’s made plays two weeks in a row. So we’re building a lot of depth right there when Cade comes back.” Well, now it’s a lot clearer what Culp can do. He’s fast, strong and big moments don’t seem to big for him. Joe would not be surprised to see Culp make an impact in the playoffs.

It hasn’t happened previously, but at least this year there’s more of a chance. NFL Network reported today that Tampa Bay assistant general manager John Spytek will interview for the Titans’ general manager opening. The Jets, as Joe noted, have the Bucs’ other assistant GM on their radar, Mike Greenberg. Frankly, Joe’s not worried about either guy leaving. Buccaneers Ring of Honor general manager Jason Licht has a veteran staff with other capable members, and Joe suspects there are good football minds around the league dying to work in Tampa for obvious reasons. Joe almost hopes Greenberg and Spytek move on.

Joe doesn’t believe that, but Bucs head coach Todd Bowles does in one particular area.  The Bucs have lost their last six regular-season night games, all in the Baker Mayfield era. Bowles strongly implied today that it doesn’t need to be studied and addressed with a routine change. “Just an odd stat for me,” he said. Sandwiched between two 2023 regular-season losses at night and four this season is a thrilling home playoff win — at night — against the Eagles last January. Still, Joe thinks there’s something to the Bucs’ night woes — a problem Joe hopes the team’s performance science gurus found worthy of studying and addressing.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/bryon-leftwich-and-total-bullsh/|Bryon Leftwich And “Total Bullsh**”|Bucs Super Bowl offensive coordinator Byron Leftwich had a job interview recently for a head coach gig. Yes, in the NFL. Leftwich was a Patriots interview. Did Tom Brady give his good friend Robert Kraft, the creepy Patriots owner, an endorsement of Leftwich? Joe’s not sure, but it will be interesting to see if Brady’s Raiders interview Leftwich for their new head coach opening. Leftwich has been out of football for two seasons, and Joe had only seen Leftwich doing interviews on Washington D.C. sports radio. Then, two weeks ago, Leftwich was the subject of a long feature at the pay-per-view site TheAthletic.com. It clearly was a staged remember-me piece to spark interesting among NFL owners. Bucco Bruce Arians was among those quoted noting it’s “total bullsh**” that Leftwich isn’t a head coach. Mike Tomlin also was quoted in support of Leftwich, but Joe will add that Tomlin didn’t hire Leftwich to be his offensive cooridinator last winter. Per The Athletic, Tom Brady was indirectly asked to participate in the Leftwich feature but it didn’t happen. Joe doesn’t see Leftwich as head coach material right now. He wasn’t good at scheming a run game and he wasn’t good with media. Those are tough hurdles to overcome. Leftwich, however, has supporters. Joe will leave fans with legendary offensive assistant coach Tom Moore’s endorsement of Leftwich after the Bucs won the Super Bowl in Feb. 2021. “I’ll say this to you. I’ve been around a long time. Byron is absolutely fantastic,” Moore told SiriusXM NFL Radio. “He is a great presenter of game plans. He has a great rapport with people. He had a great rapport with Tom [Brady]. And in my personal opinion, Bruce has done a fantastic job of training Bryon to be a head coach. He trained him to be a coordinator, and Bruce lets him go. “Now Bruce gave up playcalling, which was very, very dear to Bruce and he loved it. But he has so much faith and so much trust in Byron that he gave it up to him and let him do it. And he’s done a great job. And as I’ve told people, he just had a four week interview with the four playoff games. It is what it is; if you don’t like that, I don’t know what you like.” “[Leftwich is] really good. I sit in on most all these meetings, not to check on him or anything like that. I learn stuff, too.”|2025-01-08 12:58:00|412|51|4|Byron Leftwich|Leftwich's mixed reputation as a potential head coach.|5|Mixed sentiments towards Leftwich as a potential head coach, some support and some criticism.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""2 thumbs up"", ""post"": ""I think he\u2019d make a fantastic head coach for the Saints."", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""8th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""1:08"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Mike C"", ""post"": ""Total B S"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""8th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""1:26"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""Colin in Canada"", ""post"": ""Huge Brady fan here but Brady\u2019s lack of mobility limited the bucs run scheme.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/todd-bowles-panic-has-left-the-bucs-defense/|Todd Bowles: “Panic” Has Left The Bucs Defense|Yeah, the Bucs have used a lot of young players on their defense this season, but they’ve also got a bunch of veterans, including Super Bowl veterans, on that side of the ball.  So it was sort of strange to hear Todd Bowles say his defense had a panic disorder for much of the season, one they’ve cured. Speaking yesterday on the Buccaneers Radio Network, the head coach/defensive coordinator spoke of how the defense is now adept at staying calm after rough starts to games. “The guys are locked in. They don’t panic like they did during the first half of the season,” Bowles said. “They understand adjustments need to be made. ‘Let’s go out and execute and we’ll be fine [in] the game plan.'” The “panic” description surprised Joe. It’s very odd for a defense in Year 6 with the same boss (Bowles) and longtime leaders.

There, the Bucs will host the Commanders in the opening round of the postseason and tickets are available. Via the Bucs’ official reseller, TicketMaster, unsold tickets are available starting at $117.00 plus fees, per Joe’s searching. Joe also is seeing those “cheap” seats for $90 (plus fees) on ticket resale websites like StubHub. Joe expects a Bucs-heavy crowd on Sunday, much like the electric atmosphere the Bucs enjoyed when they hammered the Eagles at home in the playoffs last year on a Monday night.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/todd-bowles-talks-team-mentality/|Todd Bowles Talks Team Mentality|Throughout the Todd Bowles regime, the Bucs routinely have been groin-stomped and punched in the face — sometimes it’s their fault, sometimes it’s not — and then bounce back like nothing happened. Joe will start with Tom Brady bailing on 2022 training camp for 10 or 11 days. A few days after Brady left, an assistant coach told Joe. “I’m not sure Todd [Bowles] really knows exactly what’s going on with Brady.” Man, talk about a distraction! Throw in major injuries, hurricanes and losing streaks, and it hasn’t been a smooth ride through Bowles’ tenure. Joe still cringes thinking about Ryan Jensen blowing his knee out a couple of weeks before Brady bailed on training camp. Crushing! Regardless, the Bucs are sitting as NFC South champs again, as they’ve been in every Bowles season as head coach. “We’ve developed this mentality of no matter what happens, we’ll keep moving forward,” Bowles told the Buccaneers Radio Network yesterday. That really does seem like the Buccaneers’ collective way: driven and resilient.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/bucky-irving-had-an-incredible-rookie-year/|Bucky Irving Had An Incredible Rookie Year|This is what Joe calls a running back. If Joe were to tell fans that Derrick Henry or Josh Jacobs are two of the best running backs for yards after contact, few, Joe guesses, would argue. Shoot, Joe also guesses a lot of readers here have one of those players on their fantasy teams. So what if Joe mentioned that neither had the best yards after contact average per carry? Or that the Bucs have that guy? Yes, that would be Bucky Irving. Per The 33rd Team, Irving averaged four yards a carry after contact. Joe is trying to wrap his head around that. Shoot, four yards a carry isn’t awful in total. But four yards a carry after being blasted? That’s serious production. And Bucky seems like he’s half the size of Henry. What a steal in the fourth round. Per the Bucs, Bucky’s 5.4 yards per carry was the third-highest mark in NFL history among rookies with at least 200 carries in a season. So who was better? Adrian Peterson (5.6 yards in 2007) and Clinton Portis (5.5 yards in 2002).

Jason White, Sam Bradford, Baker Mayfield, Kyler Murray(also a centerfielder at OU and a top 10 MLB pick), and Williams. Hurts finished second in the Heismann voting. Williams took Rattlers job so Rattler went to South Carolina. Just found this site last year and probably have too much time on my hands being newly retired.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/numbers-crowd-crowns-liam-coen/|Numbers Crowd Crowns Liam Coen|Two stat guys Joe periodically enjoys listening to are Shaw Syed and Tej Seth. They work for former Dixie Chicks shot-caller Thomas Dimitroff’s stats outfit Sumer Sports. Syed and Seth seem to be big fans of Bucs offensive coordinator Liam Coen. So much so that, despite their self-admitted fanboy crush on Lions offensive coordinator Ben Johnson, both decided to choose Coen as their NFL offensive coordinator of the year. Basically, they love how Coen developed a strong run game from dead-last in the NFL, had Baker Mayfield playing like a top-tier quarterback, oversaw an offensive line that was dominant at times, and kept Mike Evans as an elite producer. And throw in working around the terrible loss of Chris Godwin, which would have had most teams circling the drain. “Baker Mayfield has played well but is not in that elite tier of other quarterbacks that we have talked about,” Seth began. “You lose Chris Godwin but you do a really good job of scheming up Jalen McMillan. “You bring in Bucky Irving because Rachaad White was a pretty inefficient rusher last year and you change your run-fit concepts to better fit both of them and you use two-back sets a lot” complementing their styles.” Add finding a way to get Mike Evans to 1,000 yards receiving despite missing a lot of time, Seth said, and “all of that together was super impressive.” Syed couldn’t argue. “I 100 percent agree,” Syed replied. “It has to be him. “It felt like at times, the Bucs season was over, there was no way you’re going to win the division. … When you think of teams you really want to study in the offseason, this [Bucs] run game is a really big thing and see how they do it. I can’t believe how good their offensive line looked at times.” Joe agrees that Coen did a tremendous job. He’s why the Bucs are where they are right now. If the Bucs’ offense was, say, middle of the pack, the Bucs would either be snowboarding, playing video games or hanging at Dominican beach bars nursing tropical drinks with island women rather than studying film of the Commandos. With the Bucs’ secondary ravaged by injuries, Joe thinks Coen will have to cook up a strong run attack to keep the ball out of Jayden Daniels’ mitts. |2025-01-08 04:01:00|390|33|8|Liam Coen|Stat guys praise Bucs' offensive coordinator for outstanding performance.|3|Mixed views on coaches and players' impact, with concerns about potential departures and defensive performance.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""nick houllis"", ""post"": ""MAJOR differences since the last time we played Washington: it was week 1, so 2023 stats were telling the story."", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""8th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""4:45"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Win in the Trenches"", ""post"": ""Bring it on , Bring it On \u2026.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/todd-bowles-division-crowns-better-than-you-may-think/|Todd Bowles’ Division Titles Better Than You May Think|The “Fire Todd Bowles” crowd got angry with Joe this week when Joe suggested Bowles was closer to a contract extension than getting fired. Joe cited how Bowles has won three straight division titles in his first three seasons. No other Bucs coach has done that. No, not even Chucky or Bucco Bruce Arians. Then Joe started digging. Few NFC South have ever had three straight NFC South titles, forget their first three years as a head coach. Sean Payton used to own the NFC South when he was coaching the slimy Saints. Of course, it helped to have a Hall of Fame quarterback. Payton won four NFC South titles in a row (but no Super Bowl appearances in that stretch). Riverboat Ron Rivera once won three straight division titles with the Stinking Panthers. Neither Mike Smith nor Dan Quinn ever won three straight NFC South crowns for the Dixie Chicks. Back in the day, in the throes of The Lost Decade, if Bucs fans would have been asked if they could have Payton or Rivera as coach, folks would have jumped at the chance. Then Joe started looking at contemporary coaches of NFC teams. Here are coaches who are considered superior but haven’t won three straight division titles: Kyle Shanahan, Sean McVay, Nick Sirianni and Dan Campbell. Matt LaFleur did, but he had Aaron Rodgers. Same with Mike McCarthy. So yeah, you could argue Bowles is one of the better NFC coaches. And each year Bowles’ Bucs have improved despite quarterback and offensive coordinator changes. That’s rather impressive. Arrow pointing up. Do Bowles’ conservative ways irk Joe at times? Yeah. But the results are solid when looking at the big picture? Remember, Bowles was the guy who was pushing Bucs AC/DC-loving general manager Jason Licht to sign Baker Mayfield. That was a savvy move.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/patchwork-bucs-secondary/|“Patchwork” Bucs Secondary|Not a whole lot of teams go far in the playoffs with three-fourths of their starting secondary on the shelf. But that could be what the Bucs are looking at when they face one of the better young quarterbacks in the league. The Commandos are not the same lousy team the Bucs pounded on to open the season. And while Jayden Daniels is lighting up defenses with both his arm and his legs, unlike in that first meeting four months ago, the Bucs secondary will be anything but healthy. Jamel Dean and Antoine Winfield are both iffy for Sunday’s playoff game. Jordan Whitehead? Sara Walsh of NFL Network mentioned last night his season is done due to his car wreck going to One Buc Palace on Saturday. The Bucs’ best backup safety, Christian Izien, is also out for the year having blown a pec against the Cowboys. “They need him desperately,” Walsh said of Winfield, an All-Pro safety last year. “Their other starting safety, Jordan Whitehead, was lost for the remainder of the season after he got into a car accident on Saturday going to the team facility. “The other guy who would start at safety, Christian Izien, he was lost three weeks ago for the remainder of the season. So this has really been a patchwork Bucs defense, at least in the secondary.” So what will the Commandos do Sunday? Walsh believes they will unleash Daniels on the Bucs’ secondary. “If you are looking at Washington, and how they may exploit them, you may take some shots if you are Jayden Daniels and Dan Quinn and that group,” Walsh said. They’d be stupid not to. This tells Joe that since the Bucs have one of the best running attacks in the game and the Commandos have a sorry rush defense, it’s time to play keep away and ground and pound the Commandos into sawdust. Joe wouldn’t even be surprised if Sean Tucker gouges the Commandos defense, too.
