https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/is-luke-goedeke-negotiating-a-long-term-deal/|Is Luke Goedeke Negotiating A Long-Term Deal?|Joe’s always looking for clues on the inner happenings of the Buccaneers, and this feels like a significant one. So Bucs center Graham Barton was a guest on SiriusXM NFL Radio this week and was asked about his offensive line mates and if they could handle running the Eagles famed “tush push” in short yardage. Barton said he thinks he could handle the big role of the center in that play, and then he started talking about his teammates. When he mentioned right tackle Luke Goedeke, Barton said, “Luke Goedeke, probably getting ready to sign a big deal, one of the better right tackles in the NFL.” That struck Joe because Goedeke is entering the final season of his contract and his play has put him on track for a massive new deal after the 2025 season. But Barton made it sound like Goedeke already is talking to the Bucs about an extension, which is allowed under NFL rules after players have three year of tenure. Joe would not wager on that being a random comment from Barton. He’s very savvy and guarded with his words and in the same interview he passed on answering questions that “are above my pay grade.” Goedeke is due to count about $3.6 million against the 2025 salary cap. If the Bucs are fishing for more 2025 cap room, they could shave $2 million off via a new Goedeke contract.|2025-02-20 16:29:00|236|27|7|Luke Goedeke|Goedeke may be negotiating long-term deal with Buccaneers.|6|Mixed sentiments on extending players' contracts, concerns about concussions but appreciation for the team.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Bojim"", ""post"": ""Whatever needs to be done."", ""post_time"": [""February"", ""20th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""4:39"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""PSL Bob"", ""post"": ""Seems like there is some maneuvering going on, on multiple fronts.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/gerald-mccoy-seems-to-be-recruiting-joey-bosa/|Gerald McCoy Seems To Be Recruiting Joey Bosa|Apparently, even Gerald McCoy is fed up with the Bucs’ lack of an edge rush. GMC appears to be taking matters into his own hands, trying to nudge the Bucs to visit the dark side where edge rushers wreak havoc on opposing quarterbacks. In the past few weeks, especially while he was at Radio Row at the Super Bowl, the six-time Bucs Pro Bowler was vocal that the Bucs need to get disgruntled star defensive end Myles Garrett from Cleveland. And Joe thought GMC spoke wisdom. GMC said, “First-round picks are 50/50 anyway. Myles Garrett is 100 percent.” GMC isn’t putting all his eggs in one basket, however. In replying to a rumor on Twitter that may Chargers will release talented edge rusher Joey Bosa, GMC mentioned rhetorically he knows a team in need of Bosa’s services.  Joe is confident GMC wasn’t referring to Houston. But of course, Bosa knows this. He’s from Fort Lauderdale. So he knows all about California taxes vs. Florida taxes. However, it appears Bosa is broken down physically if not past his prime, based on his past three seasons of average play after an All-Pro start to his career. Bosa, who was always brittle, now has Jamel Dean laughing at his inability to stay on the field it has gotten so bad. Bosa has played in only 28 games the last three years. Still, in those 28 games, he’s racked up 14 sacks. Not ideal. Barely OK. Would Joe take Bosa? Depends. Joe would have to consult team doctors first. Bosa is going to be 30 in July. Dudes who are 30 who can’t stay on the field are a major red flag. If the price was right (read: very cheap) Joe might take a chance and load the contract with incentives. But in no way would Joe stop shopping for an edge rusher just because you sign a guy likely to miss half the season.|2025-02-20 14:28:00|321|52|3|Gerald McCoy|GMC recruiting Joey Bosa for Bucs' edge rush.|2|Most comments express pessimism, skepticism, and reluctance towards signing Joey Bosa.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Marine Buc"", ""post"": ""Joey Bosa is an overpaid, over-hyped, under-performing, injury prone and old\u2026"", ""post_time"": [""February"", ""20th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""2:31"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""KG"", ""post"": ""No way no Bosa needed here."", ""post_time"": [""February"", ""20th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""2:36"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""Jim Fernald"", ""post"": ""Yikes \u2013 what they ^^ said"", ""post_time"": [""Jim"", ""Fernald""]}, ""commenter3"": {""username"": ""Jeff"", ""post"": ""Bosa!

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/two-major-areas-where-graham-barton-must-improve/|Two Major Areas Where Graham Barton Must Improve|After 1,000-plus snaps last season, Bucs center Graham Barton has a microscope on his performance — and that’s not just about what happens after the snap. Speaking on SiriusXM NFL Radio this week, Barton noted the two areas in which he must improve significantly. He says he has to be more steady in his play and do a better job of mastering defenses. “Just being out there and being able to communicate with confidence and be able to, you know, play a consistent four quarters. Those are the two big areas that I want to continue to improve on,” Barton said. “Just learning a new position, not coming up to the line of scrimmage and getting a defensive front that might be unfamiliar … I want to be able to confidently know what I’m seeing, what I’m looking at, and be able to get everyone on the same page in a timely manner. “I think that’s the most important job for a center. [It’s] something I look forward to improving on. And that just comes through, you know, watching film, studying different defenses, understanding the defensive coordinator you’re playing against and their tendencies … and where on the field and what situations they like to do it in. I think that’s honestly the most important thing.” Barton added that consistency and understanding defenses were his two greatest NFL challenges after the Bucs made him their first-round pick in the 2024 NFL Draft. He went on to talk about how NFL defensive coordinators “throw you off,” especially rookies. Barton had an excellent rookie year and has all the mental and physical tools to make a significant sophomore leap next season. Still, 22 years old, Joe expects Barton to get stronger and play faster, as well.|2025-02-20 11:37:00|294|32|7|Graham Barton|Barton aims to improve consistency and understanding defense for next season.|3|Mixed opinions on Barton's potential at center, some positive but also concerns.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Jeff"", ""post"": ""Move him to guard and move Hainsey back to starting center.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/upgrading-safety/|Upgrading Safety|Look, Joe is a big fan of Antoine Winfield. But how he went from breathtaking All-Pro status to being an afterthought was stunning. See if you can remember Winfield making a play last year. Joe can think of one where he was robbed of a forced fumble at the goal line because the NFL can’t see fit to have cameras on the goal line at all games. Yes, Joe knows Winfield was hurt late in Week 1 (foot) and again later in the season (knee). But man, he was so invisible he shouldn’t have been on the field later if he was hurt that badly. Then there was Jordan Whitehead. Joe was impressed with his guts when he came back from a late-season pec injury suffered against the Giants. Props to him for that. But “this Joe” saw too many Whitehead loafs throughout the season and Joe really believes if you gave Bucs types a shot of truth serum, they’d confess to buyer’s remorse after bringing him back. It wasn’t just Joe who thought Whitehead slipped badly. Walter Cherepinsky, the man behind WalterFootball.com, believes the Bucs need to upgrade at safety, specifically at Whitehead’s spot. Whitehead could become a cap casualty. We will see in the coming weeks. But the Bucs drafting a safety on the third day of the draft or signing a free agent? Let’s just say Joe wouldn’t bark in anger about that.|2025-02-20 10:30:00|236|28|4|Joe|Concerns raised about Antoine Winfield and Jordan Whitehead's performance.|7|Mixed views on defense with concerns on player performance and coaching.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/josh-grizzard-and-the-bucs-defense/|Josh Grizzard And The Bucs Defense|Rookie Bucs offensive coordinator Josh Grizzard wants something that might not soothe Bucs fans. Grizzard wants shorter drives after the Bucs ranked third in the NFL last season in time of possession at 31:41 per game. The Super Bowl champion Eagles ranked No. 1 and the explosive Lions were No. 2. Scoring faster sounds great, and theoretically it cuts the chances for drive-killing mistakes, but it’s not ideal when your defense is soft like the Bucs’ was in 2024. “We do want push the ball down the field a little bit more. That can create a little bit shorter drives,” Grizzard told The JoeBucsFan Show on WDAE radio on Saturday. “You’re not necessarily going through 12-play drives, 11-play drives all the time. And that’s going to be dependent upon the personnel, so it’s something to look forward to doing this spring and getting rolling for the season.” Indeed it will depend a lot on personnel. The Bucs should be more explosive if a healthy Chris Godwin returns and takes pressure off second-year receiver Jalen McMillan. And Joe would love to see growth from tight ends Devin Culp and Payne Durham, who have flashed a lot of potential behind Cade Otton. Speedy Trey Palmer had 39 catches as a rookie and nearly was invisible last season, so there’s potential there. Palmer is 23 years old. Joe also is intrigued to see how much of Mike McDaniel’s Dolphins offense shows up in Tampa. Grizzard told The Drive on WDAE that without two years under McDaniel he wouldn’t have been qualified to interview to work for the Bucs a year ago. Grizzard stressed that years with McDaniel taught him “manipulation of defenses through motion and the utilization of tape.” If Grizzard does shorten drives, that would represent another reason to pray the Bucs defense tightens up.|2025-02-20 10:20:00|303|21|4|Josh Grizzard|Grizzard aims to shorten Bucs' drives for stronger defense.|7|Mixed sentiments with focus on offense, needing better defense to compete effectively.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Smashsquatch"", ""post"": ""A perfect storm may be brewing for the Bucs.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/chris-godwins-hidden-value/|Chris Godwin’s Hidden Value|One thing other than defenders not wrapping up ballcarriers that drives Joe up a tree is when on third (or fourth) downs, quarterbacks go turtle. What does this mean? It’s when quarterbacks, again on third (or fourth) downs, throw short of the sticks. Joe goes absolutely mental over this. It was a hallmark of the Mike Glennon era of Bucs football. Apparently, Baker Mayfield did this more than Joe thought. But this isn’t to bash Mayfield. Instead, it’s to praise the guy Mayfield threw to when he did throw short of the sticks. Until Chris Godwin got hurt, he led the league in taking passes short of the sticks and turning them into first downs. That’s what good guy Kevin Clark of ESPN said this week when he appeared on Mina Kimes’ podcast. Clark didn’t have the figures, but he used this intel to buoy his take that if Godwin hits the free agent market on March 12, his agent will become a very popular man and Godwin may be an even richer young man. “Godwin led the league in quick throws,” Clark said, stating he read the stats on Mayfield and Godwin just before he chatted with Kimes. “He led the league in [short] passes until he got hurt. He had the ankle injury, obviously. “And obviously, we’re [expecting Godwin] to be fully healthy, fully recovered, all that stuff. But until he got hurt, he was basically leading the league in passes, short of the sticks that [were converted to first downs] after the catch.” Clark added when you combine Godwin’s production with how much of a class act he is — and a hard worker and a team-first guy — a team would be nuts not to reach out to his agent. Clark also suggested it would be very wise for Bucs AC/DC-loving general manager Jason Licht to lock up Godwin before he has a chance to dip a toe in the free agent waters. Because if he does, Clark believes, Godwin will get all sorts of cash thrown in his face. “I think when you hear that [about Godwin converting short passes to first downs], like, every single quarterback can benefit from that kind of guy,” Clark said. To listen to Clark talk, he thinks the only other wide receiver who would draw more interest is Cincinnati’s Tee Higgins. Clark seems spot on. And that’s very likely why Licht and Godwin’s camp agreed Tuesday on a two-week extension to hammer out a contract.|2025-02-20 07:00:00|416|27|7|Chris Godwin|Godwin excels at converting short passes into first downs effectively.|4|Mixed sentiments towards Chris Godwin's future with the Bucs, with concerns about age and salary.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Todd"", ""post"": ""Godwin stays.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/adam-rank-chris-godwin-should-leave-bucs/|Adam Rank: Chris Godwin Should Leave Bucs|So Tuesday word broke that Chris Godwin’s camp agreed with Bucs AC/DC-loving general manager Jason Licht to extend a deadline that would have forced a dead money hit on the Bucs’ salary cap. This extension, right up to the free agency dinner bell on March 12, gave the Bucs two extra weeks to try hammer out a deal. In Joe’s mind, that doesn’t happen unless the two sides were deep in talks or a contract was within reach. Otherwise, why else would a player’s agent agree to a contract negotiation extension? One reason the Bucs may be motivated to get Godwin done soon is that he ought to be a very popular target on the open market. NFL Network/NFL.com humorist (?) Adam Rank thinks Godwin needs to hit the open market. Rank doesn’t believe the Bucs need to bend over backward if Godwin hits free agency. Godwin will have a lot of cash thrown at him and the Bucs, Rank suggests, really don’t need him. Therefore, Ranks types, Godwin should pack up and leave Tampa for greener grasses (and a greener check).  Godwin had an abrupt and devastating end to his 2024 campaign — dislocating his ankle in Week 7 — but he still figures to garner plenty of interest on the open market. And following his injury, Tampa Bay was forced to turn the page, with rookie Jalen McMillan really coming on late last season. One team that could be a really nice fit for the well-rounded Godwin: the Rams. Joe is a big fan of Jalen McMillan. How could a Bucs fan not be? But with rookies, it’s always interesting to see how they adjust or if they can adjust. After an offensive player’s rookie season, defensive coordinators have all offseason to hatch ways to stop a player who in the final weeks of the previous season balled out. Joe is very hopeful McMillan will continue to grow. But that’s not yet a done deal. Godwin brings excellence to the table. So Joe isn’t ready to allow Godwin to walk out the door if the Bucs and Godwin’s camp are within striking distance of a new contract. Besides, after yesterday’s news, the Bucs can afford both Godwin and a top-shelf edge rusher for 2025.|2025-02-20 03:45:00|376|30|7|Chris Godwin|Godwin should consider leaving Bucs for better contract opportunity.|2|Fans express concerns about Godwin's injuries and contract, but many want him to stay.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Hodad"", ""post"": ""How much money can the Jags throw at him?

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/interesting-odds-for-baker-mayfield-in-2025/|Interesting Odds For Baker Mayfield In 2025|The carcass of the 2024 season is barely cold and already folks are wagering on the 2025 season. Per Tyler Sullivan of CBS, DraftKings is now taking bets for the NFL 2025 MVP race. (Hard Rock, the lone legal sportsbook in Florida, has not yet begun taking odds on anything for the 2025 season except for the first overall pick in April’s draft.) Per Sullivan, Baker Mayfield has interesting odds at winning the award. He’s currently has the 12th-best odds of winning league MVP at +2800, tied with Jared Goff and Caleb Williams. Sullivan doesn’t seem impressed. He’d rather go with C.J. Stroud at +2500 than lay cash on Mayfield. Not a bad call by Sullivan. Like the Bucs and the NFC South, the AFC South is often rotten. Better chance to rack up 12 or more wins, which would likely be the rock-bottom team number if a quarterback is going to win MVP. But if you are going with Stroud, why not a little extra scratch on Mayfield? At least he has experience winning with a new offensive coordinator. Too much experience if you ask Joe. (Yeah, Stroud technically had a new coordinator as a rookie in 2023.) Joe has no doubt that if the Bucs make a run to the playoffs, it will largely be because of Mayfield. So a few shekels on Mayfield at +2800 doesn’t seem like a terrible bet.|2025-02-20 00:00:00|234|19|5|Baker Mayfield|Baker Mayfield has interesting odds at NFL 2025 MVP race.|6|Mixed sentiment with some optimism about Baker Mayfield's performance and the team's potential.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Redzone"", ""post"": ""Pre-scripted \u2013 4200 yards, 36 TDs, 11 INTs, 3 rushing TDs, another \u201cPro Bowl\u201d and eliminated by the Eagles in the NFC championship after a strip sack fumble by\u2026 "", ""post_time"": [""Redzone""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Aqualung"", ""post"": ""Considering the status quo of defensive scheme and coaching personnel, for the Bucs to make the playoffs, Baker will have to have an MVP caliber season.
