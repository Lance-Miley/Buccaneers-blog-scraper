https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/lavonte-david-returns/|Lavonte David Returns!|UPDATED: 7:43 p.m. – Season No. 14 will happen for legendary Bucs linebacker Lavonte David! The Buccaneers announced tonight that David agreed to a new contract.  Buccaneers Ring of Honor general manager Jason Licht was glowing via a team release. He should be. The team’s leading tackler will not reach free agency. “Lavonte is not only one of the greatest Buccaneers in history, but is the embodiment of consistency, excellence, and leadership,” Licht said. “For over a decade, he has been the heart of our defense, setting the standard with his relentless work ethic and passion for the game. His impact on and off the field is immeasurable, and we are thrilled to have him back for another season.” Joe is fired up to see 35-year-old David get after it for one more season. He’s still damn good and the Bucs need him. Now go get an edge rusher! What a party there will be tonight at JoeBucsFan.com world headquarters. Maybe, just maybe, the Bucs will chase a proven, reasonably-priced inside linebacker to put alongside David, like pending free agent E.J. Speed. Per ESPN, David scored a $10 million deal with $9 million guaranteed. David’s fat bag eclipses what future Hall of Famer Bobby Wagner got today to return to Washington. No surprise there. The Bucs love and appreciate David that much.|2025-03-07 19:34:00|222|57|10|Lavonte David|Lavonte David re-signs with Buccaneers in a glowing announcement.|9|Fans overwhelmingly excited and optimistic about Lavonte David's return and the team's future prospects.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""LUVMYBUCS"", ""post"": ""The Legend Continues!"", ""post_time"": [""March"", ""7th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""7:35"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Chris"", ""post"": ""\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\ude4c you were right Joe ,  Bobby Wagner signing triggered it.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/its-not-just-glaring/|“It’s Not Just Glaring”|The Bucs have needs, of course, but how urgent are they? A guy who knows the Bucs extraordinarily well doesn’t seem to be losing sleep about the Bucs’ need at edge rusher as Joe does every night after running head first into blunt objects. Joe is referring to SiriusXM NFL Radio draft guru Mark Dominik, the man who preceded Jason Licht as Bucs GM. He was on the air today talking to a fan caller who essentially said the Bucs need a quality body on every position on defense. Dominik told the guy it’s not as bad as he made it sound. “You’re on point for the most part … I think you’re right; I think they’re fairly balanced, though, across the board, where it’s not just glaring,” Dominik said of Tampa Bay’s needs. Dominik added that he thinks the Bucs are in good shape and can kind of get off the edge of their seat and not freak out in the draft. “Glaring,” of course, is in the eye of the beholder. Joe can see how some Bucs observers could not think the Bucs are in panic mode when it comes to their defense. However, Joe would sit those folks down and make them watch the last two Bucs-Falcons game. The best potential news from Dominik was his assertion that he believes Lavonte David will not retire in 2025. Keep in mind Dominik drafted David, has him as a radio guest and Dominik has guys he hired still employed at One Buc Palace. The silence surrounding David’s status has been ominous, so Joe was grateful to hear Dominik weigh in.|2025-03-07 16:36:00|271|32|8|Mark Dominik|Bucs' draft needs not overwhelmingly urgent.|4|Mixed opinions on players, management, and team prospects despite some optimism.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""ballwasher61"", ""post"": ""Give David his time.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/harold-landry-set-free/|Harold Landry Set Free|A pass rusher just broke free of his loser team’s chains today. And Joe knows a team that could really, really use him. The Titans cut loose outside linebacker Harold Landry, reports Nick Suss of The Tennessean. It was because, per Suss, Landry’s cap hit would have been a massive $24 million. So now Landry, soon to be 29, is a free man. What is Bucs AC/DC-loving general manager Jason Licht going to do about it? Licht no longer has to trade a coveted draft pick for an edge rusher. All Licht has to do is order his right-hand man Mike Greenberg to find a way to get a Landry salary to work. That’s what Greenberg gets paid to do. And he does it very well. In his last three seasons of play (Landry missed the 2022 season with a blown ACL), the Boston College product has 31.5 sacks.|2025-03-07 14:09:00|149|59|'8|Harold Landry|Pass rusher released|5|Fans express a mix of hope, concern, and expectation regarding the team's future moves.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""BillyBucco"", ""post"": ""Gerald McCoy in 3,2,1"", ""post_time"": [""March"", ""7th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""2:10"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Joe"", ""post"": ""Gerald McCoy in 3,2,1"", ""post_time"": [""March"", ""7th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""2:11"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""Obvious"", ""post"": ""The way we have been drafting I\u2019d rather JL sign a one or two year deal here rather than give up a first or second for Hendrickson.

There will be more players after the draft and even from June through the start of the season. With some solid restructures and prove it deals it could set them up nicely when they will have more cap space again. Just my observations. I agree that Licht needs to get this defense right and unfortunately his track record via the draft is not well. I wonder how much harder managing the cap will be now that Spytek is gone. Seemed he might have been the real magician in that regard. Time will tell. I definitely think they need to go as much defense as possible this year and then focus on the better quarterback draft next year and seriously consider getting someone to come in behind Baker.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/nfl-network-chris-godwin-returning-to-bucs-may-be-realistic/|NFL Network: Chris Godwin Returning To Bucs May Be “Realistic”|It seems the folks at NFL Network are under the impression there will be a bidding war for Bucs wide receiver Chris Godwin, who may be a free agent on Wednesday. The Bucs had a deadline extended to Wednesday to re-sign Godwin, sparing them an ugly cap hit. Or Godwin could test the market. And if he does hit the open market, Ian Rapoport of NFL Network, speaking on “The Insiders” last night, says Godwin’s agent will be a very popular fellow fielding calls and texts from NFL teams. Don’t count the Bucs out yet, said NFL Network reporter Sara Walsh. The Bucs have a strong track record of keeping their stars. “If you go just by the Bucs’ recent history, that will tell you that it’s very realistic we see Chris Godwin in a Bucs uniform again,” Walsh said. “They’re really big names, the Bucs and Jason Licht and that front office have done an incredible job of keeping these guys in Tampa.” In a passing league, teams are hungry for proven stars catching the ball. So Godwin’s value, NFL Network suggests, is only rising. Last week at the combine in Indianapolis, Joe asked Bucs AC/DC-loving general manager Jason Licht during a recording of the Ira Kaufman Podcast if he was worried former Bucs assistant general manager and new Raiders general manager John Spytek — and his boss former Bucs quarterback Tom Brady — as well as new Jags head coach Liam Coen, might cherry pick talent from the Bucs roster. Licht responded, “That’s the NFL.” What Licht meant is that smart teams are always going to try to grab good talent. You better believe Brady/Spytek and Coen are watching to see if Godwin hits free agency. Joe would be shocked if Brady and Coen, who both have relationships with Godwin, don’t at least reach out to the Bucs’ veteran if Licht cannot hammer out a deal by Wednesday.|2025-03-07 10:30:00|320|32|7|Chris Godwin|Bucs optimistic about re-signing star receiver amidst potential bidding war.|2|Mixture of optimism and concerns about Chris Godwin's future with the Buccaneers.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Defense Rules"", ""post"": ""JL will git er done.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/will-bobby-wagner-deal-trigger-lavonte-david/|Will Bobby Wagner Deal Trigger Lavonte David?|So future Hall of Fame inside linebacker Bobby Wagner will be inking another one-year deal to return to Washington, NFL.com announced today. Wagner is a close friend of Bucs icon Lavonte David and is his 2012 draft mate. As recently as last year, David said the two talk regularly. On the Washington mic’d up segment featuring January’s Bucs-Commandos playoff game, Wagner is heard asking a Bucs player after the game if David is ok and where he is. SiriusXM NFL Radio is reporting Wagner will get $8 million guaranteed and a chance to earn up to $9.5 million with incentives. Wagner had a fantastic 2024 season, played all 17 games and got his 10th Pro Bowl invite. The silence regarding David’s future has been eerie. So Joe is wondering whether David’s camp was waiting for Wagner’s deal to be secured before pressing the Bucs on making a deal and announcing he wants to play in 2025. After all, if David plays this year, it’s very likely his final season and he might as well squeeze the Bucs for the biggest paycheck he can get. Joe has no doubt the Bucs will pay him, and now the bar on legendary returning linebackers has been set.|2025-03-07 08:10:00|204|24|6|Lavonte David|Wagner's deal may influence David's contract negotiations with Bucs.|5|Mixed sentiment with varying opinions on LaVonte David's future contract and performance.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""SteveK"", ""post"": ""Shoot, pay the man a two year deal fully guaranteed at this point.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/can-bucs-offense-continue-to-be-fast/|Can Bucs Offense Continue To Be “FAST?”|Joe admits the 2024 Bucs offense was one of the biggest, dramatic turnarounds Joe’s ever seen. In the 2022 and 2023, the Bucs were p!ss poor running the ball. Dead-last in the NFL two years running, or not running as the case was. A running offense improving to, say, No. 15 from No. 32 is a pretty big jump. Expecting a run game to improve more than that in one season is, well, unrealistic. But the Bucs behind then-new Bucs offensive coordinator Liam Coen did the unthinkable, raising their dormant run game to No. 4 in the NFL. Unreal! Appearing on the Barstool Sports podcast “Pardon My Take” with co-hosts Big Cat and PFT Commenter, Coen gave major props to Bucs players saying they all bought in to what he preached and embraced playing “FAST.” Coen said the acronym embodied what he wanted the offense to be. F = Fundamentally sound. A = Attacking. S = Situational masters. T = Tough mentally and physically. “That’s where it starts,” Coen said. “That’s where it stems. The mentally and physically tough part is what we really want to talk about. “We go into Tampa this year, they had the 32nd-ranked run game in the NFL in the last two seasons. And we go in and bring it to No. 4. “It was buy-in. It was all about toughness. It was physicality, the way that we wanted to play the game, our style of play.” The man who may have represented “FAST” best? Coen singled out Bucs star receiver Mike Evans. Why Evans? Coen explained with his status across the NFL and in Tampa, he could have just worried about catching passes and that’s it. Who was going to bark at a future Hall of Fame player? Nobody. Instead, Coen said, Evans embodied the “FAST” mentality, playing constantly with grit and determination on all plays, pass or run. “I mean, dude, Mike Evans is digging out support on safeties,” Coen gushed. “He doesn’t have to do that stuff!” And Coen said that was just an example of what kind of class guy Evans is, and the consummate professional Evans strives to be, the ultimate teammate. “There was immediate buy-in,” Coen said of the Bucs offense. Now, the only question is can the Bucs carry that “FAST” attitude into 2025 with new offensive coordinator Josh Grizzard?|2025-03-07 07:00:00|392|18|7|Bucs offense|"Dramatic improvement and ""FAST"" mentality propel Bucs offense to success."|5|Mixed sentiments ranging from support and optimism to criticism and negativity.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Beeej"", ""post"": ""\u201cI mean, dude, Mike Evans is digging out support on safeties,\u201d Coen gushed. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have to do that stuff!\u201d"", ""post_time"": [""March"", ""7th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""7:14"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Lt.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/yes-you-guessed-it-gerald-mccoy-wants-jason-licht-to-go-get-trey-hendrickson/|Yes, You Guessed It: Gerald McCoy Wants Jason Licht To Go Get Trey Hendrickson|It’s time to bring Trey Hendrickson back home. That’s the message former Bucs six-time Pro Bowl defensive tackle Gerald McCoy is telling Bucs AC/DC-loving general manager Jason Licht. The graduate of Warren Sapp High School in Apopka who later played college ball at Florida Atlantic needs to come home, GMC says. Come home and play for the edge-rusher starved Bucs. When news surfaced yesterday that stingy Bengals owner Mike Brown gave Hendrickson, the 2024 NFL’s sack king (17.5 sacks), who has had 35 sacks in the past two years, permission to seek a trade, it didn’t take long for GMC to take to Twitter to rhetorically ask Licht, “What are you waiting for?”  @Geraldini: BUCS FANS!! Yall keep saying I’m wrong. I guess I’m wrong about this one too huh!?! OH WELL @jasonrlicht HELLO!! Joe finds it funny and appealing that GMC is totally fed up with the lack of a Bucs’ edge rush. He, too, feels the Bucs are a seasoned, established edge rusher away from making real noise in the postseason. It’s funny how for virtually every edge rusher that either is a free agent or is rumored to be trade bait, GMC goes on social media and begs Licht directly to get GMC’s favorite pass rusher flavor of the day. Myles Garrett one day, Joey Bosa the next. Now, Hendrickson. As for Hendrickson, would Joe like to have him lining up next to Calijah Kancey and Vita Vea? Hell, yes! But is this even remotely possible? Would the Bucs have to sacrifice Lavonte David to get Hendrickson? But if Hendrickson is available, if you’re Licht, don’t you at least have to call Brown and ask what the ransom is?|2025-03-07 03:45:00|282|33|7|Gerald McCoy|McCoy urges Bucs to pursue Trey Hendrickson for edge rush.|5|Mixed sentiment with cautious optimism regarding the team's defensive needs and potential for success.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Bob"", ""post"": ""GMC spent best part of a decade without any pass rush so it\u2019s understandable that he is rooting for us to go get.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/bspn-underrated-ben-bredeson/|BSPN: “Underrated” Ben Bredeson|Just gauging the comments on this here corner of the interwebs, more than a few Bucs fans want the team to wash its hands of left guard Ben Bredeson. Joe doesn’t get this. At all. The Bucs had one of the better offensive lines in the game blocking for one of the best quarterbacks, one of the best passing offenses and one of the best running attacks. Where exactly is the evidence that Bredeson is dragging the team down? Ben Solak of BSPN thinks Bredeson is an “underrated” free agent. He seems to imply Bucs fans will miss him if he jumps off the pirate ship next week in free agency. In fact, Solak thinks the Chargers will be in play for Bredeson. Why? Well, Chargers coach Jim Harbaugh recruited the Michigan Man at Michigan, coached Bredeson at Michigan and the team Harbaugh currently coaches needs guards. Buccaneers G Ben Bredeson: The left guard was unspectacular but rock solid on a one-year deal this past season, and will look to leverage that into a multiyear extension somewhere. Bredeson has played on both sides of the line, which will increase his value for teams with multiple open spots. It’s worth noting he played for Jim Harbaugh at Michigan and was drafted by John Harbaugh’s Ravens when Greg Roman was offensive coordinator. The Chargers need some guards. What Solak wasn’t specific about is that Roman, the offensive coordinator who worked with Bredeson as a rookie, is now Jim Harbaugh’s coordinator in Los Angeles. Joe is a big believer in not fixing something that isn’t broken. The Bucs’ offensive line was not broken. Not at all. NFL coaches preach for hours how consistency with guys on an offensive line is critical. Tristan Wirfs also preaches this Gospel. So why not keep Bredeson? He’s 27 and durable, and he’s inexpensive and just based on the Bucs’ line play last year, Bredeson is getting the job done.|2025-03-07 00:00:00|322|20|9|Ben Bredeson|Bredeson touted as underrated and valuable for Buccaneers.|6|Mixed sentiments with some optimism about the player's performance and value, but concerns about cost.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""OR Buc"", ""post"": ""The key word, inexpensive.
