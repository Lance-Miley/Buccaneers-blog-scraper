After needing stunning Buccaneers errors on offense to score 23 points to beat Tampa Bay on Sunday night, Washington came out tonight and dropped 45 points on the Lions — in Detroit.  They even scored 31 in the first half and missed a field goal late. Despite having a guy many consider a superstar defensive coordinator in Aaron Glenn, the Lions literally had no answers. Washington rolled up nearly 500 yards. What does this say about Todd Bowles, the Bucs head coach/defensive coordinator who is public enemy No. 1 for a lot of Tampa Bay fans? Joe’s not sure if the Lions-Commanders result is relevant to the state of the Bucs, but it sure is something to think about. It’s easy to argue now that Bowles’ defense was nowhere near as ugly as it might have appeared Sunday. Man, Joe would love to see what was being typed tonight in the Team Glazer group text. The mighty Lions are dead in the NFC. The Eagles, a team Todd Bowles’ Bucs owned this season and last, is the favorite to face the Commanders in next week’s NFC Championship game. Joe wonders if a sect of Lions fans now will start screaming for head coach Dan Campbell’s head because he chokes in big games — and because the team can’t afford to lose its star offensive coordinator Ben Johnson. Does this mean Todd Bowles is a defensive genius? — JoeBucsFan (@JoeBucsFan) January 19, 2025|2025-01-18 23:23:00|246|154|9|Todd Bowles|Washington dominates Lions|3|Mixed opinions with criticisms of individual players and coaches, some defending and some blaming them.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Capt Ahab"", ""post"": ""Five turnovers was the difference, can\u2019t win turning the ball over."", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""18th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""11:26"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Bucs 95"", ""post"": ""Mayfield > goff in the postseason"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""18th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""11:28"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""Steven007"", ""post"": ""Every game is different.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/anonymous-nfl-suit-claims-liam-coen-had-impressive-interview-with-the-jags/|Anonymous NFL Suit Claims Liam Coen Had Impressive Interview With The Jags|Joe found the following quite curious since two of the more well-plugged-in NFL insiders seemingly have different information. Ian Rapoport of NFL Network and Dan Graziano of BSPN indicated Bucs offensive coordinator Liam Coen is not a favorite to be the next Jags coach following his interview last week. Rapoport suggested Coen is not among the “names to watch” to land the Jags opening. Graziano predicted Coen will not be the Jags’ next coach. However, an unnamed NFL suit tells John Shipley of SI.com that Coen killed it in his interview with the Jags. In fact, this same suit claims he would not be shocked if the Jags job went to either Detroit offensive coordinator Ben Johnson or Coen. “Liam Coen was nothing short of outstanding in his interview,” a senior NFL executive told Jacksonville Jaguars on Sports Illustrated. “His knowledge of the game, both offensively and defensively, was eye-opening, as well as his handles on the responsibilities and how he would lead a franchise. … “Nobody I spoke to in that organization was anything other than impressed, and I think it would be safe to say him and Ben Johnson are 1A and 1B on their shortlist. What is interesting to Joe is no heavy-hitter NFL insider — not Jay Glazer (is that dude ever wrong?), not Adam Schefter, not Rapaport — in any pregame shows today had any intel like this. If one of those three had the same information, Joe promises we would have heard it by now. Perhaps tomorrow morning one of the three will have an update once the pregame shows get revved up. Joe is not dismissing this report — impressing someone in an interview in the NFL does not necessarily mean a job offer is imminent (the NFL works weirdly that way — but Joe wants to hear a high-profile NFL insider back this report up before Joe starts to break out into hives that Coen may be gone.|2025-01-18 23:00:00|326|30|7|Liam Coen|Coen impresses in interview for Jags head coaching position.|5|Mix of pessimistic and optimistic comments about various team and coaching aspects.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Rod Munch"", ""post"": ""The only good thing about Bum Baker choking in that Redskins game is that it might mean the Bucs end up keeping Coen."", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""18th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""11:02"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Ds"", ""post"": ""With the lions getting bounced hope the jags hire Ben Johnson tomorrow lol"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""18th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""11:03"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""Badbucs"", ""post"": ""No bueno."", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""18th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""11:04"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter3"": {""username"": ""Tbbucs3"", ""post"": ""Impressive interview "", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""18th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""11:05"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter4"": {""username"": ""El HEFE"", ""post"": ""I wonder if the Lions fans are calling for their coaches head like we call for our coaches head because we only lost by a couple of points even though a loss is a loss.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/bucky-irving-no-84/|Bucky Irving No. 84|NFL teams have 53 players on active rosters. That’s 1,696 guys on 32 teams. So Seth Walder of BSPN, a man who never met a number he didn’t like, has decided to try to cobble together the top-100 most valuable players. As always, “value” is not “best.” In theory, the best player could be on the Bears but since the Bears don’t win, how valuable is the guy? You mean the Bears couldn’t be in last place without him? Believe it or not, Walder has a rookie in his top-100. And this rookie is a Bucs rookie, Bucky Irving, ranked at No. 84. In Joe’s mind, Bucky is right there in value on the Bucs offense with Mike Evans and Baker Mayfield. Think about it: Would the Bucs have won the division, or made the playoffs without Bucky? Unlikely. In 2022 and 2023, the Bucs had the worst NFL rushing attack. That didn’t change dramatically because the Bucs stuck with underperforming Rachaad White. (Yes, Joe knows hardcore White truthers believe, damn the non-production and damning stats, he’s the next Tony Dorsett and you just don’t know any better.) This season’s rushing attack exploded to fourth-best in the NFL from 32nd because of Bucky, plain and simple. All of a sudden, defenses had to respect it, which helped Mayfield and Evans. You cannot deny the numbers. And Bucky’s numbers speak for themselves.|2025-01-18 18:00:00|231|0|5|Bucky Irving|Bucs rookie No. 84 elevates team with outstanding performance.||No comments available.|{}

A couple of huge voices in NFL media think he closed his campaign with a major mistake. Joe likes and respects Coen, but that doesn’t mean Joe will ignore major darts fired in Coen’s direction. First, Joe will turn to retired All-Pro running back Tiki Barber, who is very friendly to Tampa Bay because his brother is a Bucs legend. Speaking on his WFAN radio show this week, Barber roasted Coen for running a jet sweep from his own 15 yard line in the fourth quarter Sunday against the Commanders. Baker Mayfield and receiver Jalen McMillan fumbled the first-down call and Washington recovered on the 12 yard line. The Commanders scored a touchdown four plays later. Barber talked about the crushing turning point and blamed the first-year NFL playcaller. “The fumble that led to the touchdown was on Liam Coen. It was just a stupid playcall,” Barber said. “Why are you running a reverse on the 15 yard line. Like seriously, just go forward. We all do the same thing when you’re backed up. Go forward. Don’t try to get, I don’t know, cute.” Ouch! Barber also took shots at Todd Bowles’ overall clock management. Former Jets linebackers coach and personnel chief Pat Kirwan, the prime time voice on SiriusXM NFL Radio, also said Coen got it wrong. “People want to cite the fumble on the jet sweep. Please, why are you calling a jet sweep, which is a very tricky, timed-up play?” Kirwan railed. “The guy’s flying across the backfield and you’re going to take the snap and hand it to him deep in your own territory?” Joe already has noted how successful the Bucs were this season running the sweep. So Joe doesn’t think the call was out of line, only the execution. However, it is rare to run a sweep that deep in your own territory, and it’s fair to note it’s a handoff that carries more risk than most.|2025-01-18 17:04:00|331|75|4|Liam Coen|Ex-Coach And Former Star RB Criticize Coen's Playcall Choices.|5|Mixed reactions to a risky play call in a critical moment in a football game.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Dom"", ""post"": ""If you can\u2019t trust your players to be able to handle a jet sweep hand-off than that\u2019s an indictment on the players not the coaching staff.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/todd-bowles-doesnt-seem-to-want-to-think-of-nfl-life-without-lavonte-david/|Todd Bowles Doesn’t Seem To Want To Think Of NFL Life Without Lavonte David|Todd Bowles doesn’t seem to get very sentimental about football players, at least not in front of the local pen and mic club. But Bowles seemed to turn sentimental early Monday when asked about how much Bucs legendary linebacker Lavonte David means to the franchise. “Personally, we’ve gotten very close over the years I’ve been here,” Bowles said at his season-ending news conference. “He’s a coach on the field, he’s a captain, he’s a leader, he’s a heck of a person off the field. “He’s our bell cow. When things go wrong, he’ll fix it from a mental standpoint in the locker room. He gets everybody lined up in the right plays, he understands the game – as well as making a ton of plays himself. “He’s meant everything to me, as well as our coaching staff and the players in this building.” Simply put, you don’t replace a guy like David not just for what he has produced on the field, but for what he has meant to be a professional. There is a reason the Bucs personnel department has a poster of its model franchise player. That graphic happens to be a silhouette of David. The Bucs defense is shaky now. If David goes, the Bucs really have no inside linebackers. Remember, K.J. Britt is a free agent, as well. But Joe, what about SirVocea Dennis? How can Joe bank on an injured guy who entering his third season has never started a game and last year missed 13 games in addition to the playoffs?|2025-01-18 11:00:00|257|55|9|Lavonte David|Bowles expresses deep appreciation for David's impact and leadership.|3|Comments showcase concerns around LB position, need for replacements, and evaluation of existing players.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""TampaBayBucFan"", ""post"": ""IMO LVD will be back if for no other reason than to mentor SVD & others\u2026.perhaps a high ILB drat pick."", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""18th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""11:08"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""stpetebucsfan"", ""post"": ""LVD is the ONLY ILB on the Bucs right now.

That’s natural and healthy. It’s great when fans care deeply and bring passion from all angles. So could some fans’ opinions of Bowles change tonight, based on the Commanders-Lions result? This was a question brought forth on the Ira Kaufman Podcast by Sage Ira himself. “Absolutely,” Joe replied. A Commanders upset win in Detroit could move some Bucs fans to soften their rage at Bowles, just as a Lions blowout could lead some fans to run head first into walls knowing the Tampa Bay offense has enough juice to run up the score on Detroit. Many probably think tonight’s result is irrelevant. Joe’s view of the Bucs could adjust a little after tonight’s game. Maybe. Joe has to see how it looks on the field. Back in the 2007 season, the Bucs lost their playoff opener at home to the Giants after winning the NFC South. Joe was crushed.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/bucs-saw-same-attack-plan/|Bucs Saw Same Attack Plan|So what was the key to beating the 2024 Buccaneers defense? No, cynical and sour Bucs fans, “showing up” is not the answer. There is no single answer, of course, but fans paying attention saw too often that short passes and feeding on the Bucs’ soft, soft, ,soft zone defense was a key to opponents’ success. Joe found it noteworthy how Bucs defensive line coach Kacy Rodgers responded when asked to name the Bucs’ challenges when they struggled to get off the field against the Commanders on Sunday. The Bucs, he said, saw nothing fresh in Washington’s approach. “The way Washington attacked us, if you really look at the last three teams kind of did the same kind of game plan,” Rodgers told the Buccaneers Radio Network. “It was short passing game, run it, keep third down very manageable — 3rd-and-3 is really hard to stop in the National Football League because so many aspects [so many ways to attack it]. This past team (Washington), they had the aspect of not only running, but the quarterback running. So you had to keep him in the pocket where you’re kind of outnumbered. If you blitz him, you leave a bad matchup. It’s just, mobile quarterbacks pose a lot of problems.” So the Bucs sort of knew what was coming and couldn’t stop it. The Commanders had five drives of 10 plays or more (a rare total) and did not punt.|2025-01-18 09:19:00|239|41|4|Bucs|Struggles against short passes in defensive play.|2|Overall negative sentiment towards defensive coaching and performance.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Pmike"", ""post"": ""Going to be interesting to see how a team that mostly implements man coverage (Lions) is going to fair against JD.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/mike-evans-may-have-won-the-final-battle/|Mike Evans May Have Won The Final Battle|For the national media, the game Sunday night between the Bucs and the Commandos wasn’t so much Washington vs. Tampa Bay or even Jayden Daniels vs. Baker Mayfield. No, it was Marshon Lattimore vs. Mike Evans. Those two have a long history of fighting (literally) a couple of times a year. In November, the slimy Saints traded Lattimore to the Commandos. So the first time the two squared off was Sunday in the wild card round. It sure looked like Lattimore, 28, is on the downside of his career. Evans toyed with him and then schooled Lattimore for a touchdown. Evans worked Lattimore so much that it had Shannon Sharpe laughing out loud on his podcast “Nightcap,” co-hosted with Chad Johnson. “It wasn’t the same,” Johnson said of the expected duel between Evans and Lattimore. “Mike cooked him!” Sharpe laughed, interrupting Johnson. “Mike got him, he did,” Johnson said trying not to laugh as Sharpe giggled in the background. “Mike got the best of him.” Sharpe said Evans had a full campground setup inside Lattimore’s head. “It got so bad Lattimore was trying to hip-drop tackle him!” Sharpe bellowed. “You see that on every play. That man tried to hip-drop tackle him on every play. “I was like, ‘C’mon, man!” It was a wonderful thing to see. And Sharpe was right, Lattimore was so angry he looked like he was trying to take Evans out. Once a slimy Saint, always a slimy Saint. Sunday night might be the last time we see Evans and Lattimore square off. The Bucs and Commandos, barring another playoff matchup, are not scheduled to play each other until 2027. Who knows if Evans and/or Lattimore will even be in the league then? Evans will turn 32 in training camp.
