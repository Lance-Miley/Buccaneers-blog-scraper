https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/ominous-stat-tied-to-bucs-coordinator-change/|Ominous Stat Tied To Bucs’ Coordinator Change|So CBS HQ dropped an interesting nugget yesterday. The Bucs are the fourth team in the Super Bowl era of NFL history to lose an offensive coordinator to a head coaching job in consecutive seasons. The first was the 1990 Redskins. Hey, Todd Bowles played for that team! But those Redskins don’t really count because head coach Joe Gibbs was the offensive playcaller and mastermind, per Joe’s research. Next was the 2007 49ers. After the 2005 and 2006 seasons, respectively, playcallers Mike McCarthy and Norv Turner left the building. In 2007, the Niners ranked last in the NFL in offense with only five victories. The last time a franchise was left in this predicament was the 2015 Ravens. They collapsed. Jim Caldwell bolted for the Lions head coaching gig after the 2013 season and a year later Gary Kubiak ran to the Broncos. Baltimore finished 2015 season with a 5-11 record. It was the worst season of John Harbaugh’s iconic head coaching career — by a mile. And here come the Bucs. Rookie playcaller Josh Grizzard has taken over for Liam Coen. “El Serpiente” is now the Jaguars’ head coach and 2023 Bucs offensive coordinator Dave Canales enters his second season running the Panthers. Very small sample size, but it seems losing quality coordinators back-to-back is a major challenge. Yes, Joe knows all about continuity and the Bucs’ desire to achieve it by promoting Grizzard. Smart move, but it’s also wise to understand the offense will change a lot more than Bucs fans might be considering.|2025-02-21 16:54:00|256|21|3|Bucs' Coordinator Change|Losing coordinators consecutively poses major challenge for teams.|5|Fans express mixed emotions regarding coaching changes|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""FilthyAnimal"", ""post"": ""If Grizzard wasn\u2019t already part of the last staff and was bringing in a new system, I might be slightly concerned.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/bucs-shuffle-linebackers-coaches/|Bucs Shuffle Linebackers Coaches|When the Bucs last had a powerful edge rush, their outside linebackers coach was Larry Foote. He’s back in that role again. Foote arrived in Tampa with the Bruce Arians-Todd Bowles regime and was tasked with teaching a Jason Pierre-Paul to play in a 3-4 defense (the Giants had him in a 4-3) and even (gasp!) drop in coverage. Foote also was asked to bring along a young free agent edge rusher named Shaq Barrett. Yes, Foote did an excellent job but then was moved to coach inside linebackers for the 2022 season. The Bucs made it official today that Foote will move back to coach the outside linebacker. Joe is feeling good vibes. At inside linebackers coach will be another familiar face, Mike Caldwell. He was Jaguars defensive coordinator in 2022 and 2023, and was a Raiders linebackers coach last year. Caldwell is now back in the same role he held in Tampa from 2019-21.|2025-02-21 15:17:00|156|19|7|Bucs|Shuffle of linebackers coaches with positive outcome.|6|Mixed reactions, some optimistic about coaching changes while others skeptical or critical.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""BakerTime"", ""post"": ""Getting the band back together.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/overtime-sucks/|“Overtime Sucks”|NFL teams love to point to their records in one-score games as a way of spinning a positive projection. It doesn’t matter whether they won few or lots of those games. Losing many one-score games means you’re “this close” to greatness. Winning lots of them shows you know how to win and are mentally tough. Which is accurate? Joe can’t answer that. It’s an ultimate spin job. Last season, the Bucs had a 3-6 record in one-score games, including the playoff loss and a 1-2 record in overtime. Still, Tampa Bay won 10 games. That overall reality has given Bucs players an internal confidence, a feeling of being within reach of greatness. Joe has a similar feeling and thinks the Bucs are an edge rusher, a punter and better defensive depth from being special. In 2023, Tampa Bay was 3-4 in one-score games after going 6-4 with Tom Brady in one-score affairs in 2022. (Remember, the Bucs had a legit defense in 2022). One-score games always have been a fun side note in Bucs history. Former head coach Dirk Koetter used to focus on them. Oh, the Bucs were getting close, Koetter said. Then Koetter’s 2018 season featured a 4-7 record in tight games, and that paved the way for the Bucco Bruce Arians regime. Joe once heard a Bucs official have the audacity to reference being competitive while losing 9 of 10 one-score games during the 2-14 season of 2014. Sorry, no team is competitive while it goes winless at home like those 2014 Bucs did. Tristan Wirfs was talking close games on Media Row at the Super Bowl this month and noted to SportsGrid how “overtime sucks.” Joe heard that and immediately remembered how Wirfs was injured in overtime of the Bucs’ mind-numbing loss to a bad Browns team in 2022. Todd Bowles actually played for overtime that rotten day in Cleveland, citing a fear of a Tom Brady interception. Wirfs and Antoine Winfield were injured in the extra period. Close games have consequences. And Wirfs is right. Overtime sucks. It’s a breeding ground for injuries and does a great job draining your team for the next game.|2025-02-21 14:20:00|360|17|2|Overtime|Impact of close games and overtime on NFL teams.|2|Mixed sentiments with criticisms on coaching, desire for domination, and frustration with close games.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Aqualung"", ""post"": ""The Bucs performance in 2024 in such games proves we are lacking the necessary skill at situational coaching and tight game management.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/sec-defenders-on-daniel-jeremiahs-radar-for-bucs-at-no-19/|SEC Defenders On Daniel Jeremiah’s Radar For Bucs At No. 19|OK, you know we are approaching draft season if Daniel Jeremiah holds a press conference about draft prospects. With the combine next week in Indianapolis, Jeremiah, the popular NFL Network draft analyst and former NFL scout, gave his annual pre-combine press conference. He will have another one when the combine wraps up a week from tomorrow. (Before you hit Joe with: “But Joe, the combine is still going on after Saturday… ” There is a difference between the combine the media attends and cares about and the combine the TV show seen on NFL Network. The combine the media attends is all the frontroom and backroom dealings centered in downtown Indianapolis with the beehive being the Indiana Convention Center, which used to be the Hoosier Dome. It is packed with (some) NFL owners, NFL suits of all sorts, scouts aplenty, most head coaches and their assistants, plus heavy hitter agents including but not limited to Tom Condon, oily Drew Rosenhaus and Bob LaMonte. Also, NFL media of all sorts is there. And yes, the players. It’s sort of like the NFL’s winter festival. The combine the TV show that fans see from home is the underwear Olympics at Lucas Oil Stadium. “This Joe” has been to the last, oh, dozen combines and he has still yet to witness one iota of the glorified indoor track practice at Lucas Oil.) Jeremiah yesterday was asked specifically about the Bucs possibly looking for defense at No. 19. Joe knows the last time the Bucs picked at No. 19 was two years ago and it sure looks like Bucs AC/DC-loving general manager Jason Licht found a good one in Calijah Kancey. Jeremiah seems to believe the Bucs are going defense in the first round (which directly mocks his very different Bucs pick in his latest mock draft). And he thinks the Bucs may just grab one of two SEC defenders. Jeremiah likes the Bucs selecting linebacker Jihaad Campbell of Alabama as a no-brainer pick for Todd Bowles. “Well, aggressive guys that can blitz from anywhere,” is how Jeremiah described what Bowles and the Bucs may be looking for. Jihaad Campbell would be sure as heck fun to watch there just with all the different things he can do, and fast and explosive and smart. “That’s a good combination for Coach Bowles to be able to play with there. That’s the first thing that jumped off the top of my head here when I’m thinking about those types of players.” But wait, there’s more. If the Bucs decided to go after an edge rusher instead, Mykel Williams from Georgia is a guy to watch Jeremiah believes. “You can do a lot of different things with him in terms of rushing him inside, rushing him outside,” Jeremiah said. “He’s athletic enough if you want to drop him. He can do a lot of those things as well.” Jeremiah said Campbell and Williams are “dynamic.” Joe loved Campbell last season. Williams? Dude didn’t have any more sacks than Campbell, a linebacker. Both had five. Nah man, five sacks playing against children doesn’t impress Joe. If the Bucs want to go defensive end (Joe hopes not only because name the last rookie edge rusher this coaching staff has developed?), Joe would much rather see the Bucs get Marshall’s Mike Greene, who absolutely dominated Senior Bowl practices. Greene last year had 17 sacks in 13 games in 2024 — 17! That, boys and girls, is production! Joe would have to find out exactly why Williams only had five sacks in 12 games if he is supposed to be such an otherworldly edge rusher. As far as Campbell coming in, Joe would fully embrace it.    |2025-02-21 10:30:00|615|31|6|SEC Defenders|Daniel Jeremiah predicts Bucs draft defensive players from SEC.|4|Mixed opinions on draft priorities, uncertainty over talent development, and preference for proven players.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Watch Daddy Sling It"", ""post"": ""Fully with Joe on this one."", ""post_time"": [""February"", ""21st,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""10:34"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""BuckyBuc"", ""post"": ""pass rush from the edge is 100x more important than a linebacker\u2026"", ""post_time"": [""February"", ""21st,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""10:36"", ""am""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""BFFL"", ""post"": ""Draft edge again?

Wirfs belted one out of the park. Appearing on Ari Meirov’s podcast in New Orleans during Super Bowl week for The33rdTeam, Wirfs was asked why the NFL community always seems to give Bucs icon Lavonte David the short end of the stick. Wirfs, in so many words, suggested those in the NFL world who don’t give David his just due are criminals. “I don’t know,” Wirfs answered Meirov of David getting stiffed annually for honors and awards. “You talk about greats — [David] is criminally underrated and criminally under-recognized for what he’s done and been doing for a long time. “It’s a shame, it is. “Lavonte is an incredible human being, an incredible football player. He has been doing it for 13 seasons now. But I don’t know why. I don’t know if it’s because of a small market. It can’t be that small of a market, it’s Tampa. “I don’t know what it is but Lavonte David is gonna have a gold jacket one day.” Just to reinforce Wirfs’ point about market size, per Nielsen Media Research ratings, which is the television industry standard for researching TV ratings and TV markets, Tampa Bay is the No. 11 market in the United States, just below San Francisco/Oakland/San Jose and just above Phoenix. Tampa Bay is a bigger TV market than Detroit, Minneapolis, Miami and Cleveland. Yet if David played for the 49ers, Lions, Vikings, Dolphins or Browns, you think he’d get shafted year after year like he does with the Bucs? Hell, no! There’s not much more to add about Wirfs defending David. He was spot on.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/bspn-chris-godwins-best-decision-should-be-to-remain-with-bucs/|BSPN: Chris Godwin’s Best Decision Should Be To Remain With Bucs|Guys, things are rolling really quickly in the NFL. Before you know it, the Bucs will have a press conference to announce their new 10-sack edge rusher (Joe dreams). Next week is the combine in cold Indianapolis. Less than two weeks later, the free agency dinner bell rings! With illegal tampering ramping up next week in downtown Indy, it’s time to see where some of the more coveted free agents should land. Former NFL safety and current Chicagoland high school coach Matt Bowen cobbled together a list of free agents and where he thinks they should land, not where they will land. Among the top free agents is Bucs receiver Chris Godwin. And who does Bowen believe Godwin is the best fit for? The Bucs. Yes, Bowen thinks it would be smart of Godwin to stay home. …ontinuing to work alongside Mike Evans would be the right move for Godwin. Before suffering a season-ending left ankle injury in Week 7, Godwin’s 50 receptions over the first seven games were the most in the NFL. He’s a savvy and proven route runner with the toughness to work the heavy-traffic areas of the field for quarterback Baker Mayfield. Since Bowen mentioned toughness, Joe will bring up again the stat from Kevin Clark that Joe found really, really interesting. Godwin (Clark didn’t offer the exact numbers) led the NFL in taking passes behind the sticks and turning the catches into first downs. And then he got injured. Who wouldn’t want a receiver who consistently moves the chains? And, Joe thinks Godwin may have a pair of the most underrated hands in the game. If he drops a pass, it’s time to chug. That’s how rare that is. Yeah, Joe thinks Godwin would be smart to stay in Tampa. But the real question is what does Godwin think?|2025-02-21 03:45:00|304|21|7|Chris Godwin|Godwin should remain with Bucs for success.|5|Mixed sentiments on Chris Godwin's future with the Bucs, ranging from optimism to caution.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Ryan"", ""post"": ""Joe\u2013are you going to Indy to cover the Combine ?"", ""post_time"": [""February"", ""21st,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""5:28"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""BucU"", ""post"": ""Take a little home town discount and end your career with the Bucs CG."", ""post_time"": [""February"", ""21st,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""6:32"", ""am""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""stpetebucsfan"", ""post"": ""I agree with BucU!"", ""post_time"": [""February"", ""21st,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""6:47"", ""am""]}, ""commenter3"": {""username"": ""FortMyersDave"", ""post"": ""Finally, a logical take on Chris Godwin which is not home grown in Tampa.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/going-after-a-receiver-wouldnt-be-a-bad-idea/|Going After A Receiver Wouldn’t Be A Bad Idea|Bucs legend Mike Evans will be 32 next month. As fans saw last year, he still is superior. But age is slowly creeping up on Evans. Notice how he needed to take more time off to heal his hamstring injuries than before? The Bucs lost every game Evans was inactive due to his bum hamstring, which included losses to Atlanta, Kansas City and San Francisco. While “this Joe” doesn’t think the Bucs should break the bank for a receiver or select one in the first two days of the draft, it wouldn’t be a dumb move if Bucs AC/DC-loving general manager Jason Licht found a competent receiver to add to the receiver corps. Well, with Jalen McMillan, Joe wants to see how he does next season. There was a lot to like about McMillan’s rookie year. Here’s the catch, though (no pun intended). Defensive coordinators noticed McMillan was hotter than a firecracker as the season ended. Now, those same coordinators have all offseason to hatch a plan to slow him down. Football is a game of adjustments. Can McMillan adjust? There’s a cautionary tale currently on the Bucs roster. Trey Palmer looked like he was about to be a dangerous receiver after 39 catches as a rookie. Former offensive coordinator Dave Canales primarily used Palmer as a go-route receiver, Liam Coen tried to make Palmer a more well-rounded receiver last year. Palmer never seemed comfortable in his new role. In fact, off the top of Joe’s head, the only big play Palmer made last season was when he was on the field with the rally duck. You know, when J.J. Russell returned a blocked punt for a score? Most rookies who become successful make a jump from their rookie year to Year 2. Joe is curious to see how McMillan plays now that he’s on defensive coordinators’ radars. Sterling Shepard was just meh. He made plays (32 catches) and he made some really dumb moves, too. With Shepard, it seemed every good play he made was negated by a dumb play. So yeah, adding a receiver to the mix for the Bucs wouldn’t be a bad call.
