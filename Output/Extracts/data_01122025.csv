https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/soft-zone-polishes-off-season/|Soft Zone Polishes Off Season|Why do opposing receivers often frolic through the Bucs defense like deer in corn fields? Commanders QB Jayden Daniels completed a tick under 69 percent of his passes tonight. And Joe would wager that nobody attending in The Licht House was surprised. The Bucs ranked in the bottom third of the NFL this season when it comes to allowing opposing QBs to complete passes. They converted on 66.35 percent of their throws. The Bucs were equally as bad last year in that department. But more important is how wide open receivers were consistently, which ties to why the Bucs had a significant drop in forced turnovers this season. The Bucs’ deficiencies in that area were on full display tonight for the football world. Frankly, Joe is numb. Tykee Smith seemed to hit a rookie wall. J.J. Russell is a practice-squad caliber linebacker. The Bucs’ edge rush needs to be better, and tight coverage is too hard to find. The overall defense is not the only reason the Bucs’ season ended tonight, but it is the weakness of the team, a team led by a defense-first head coach. This Bucs defense was the worst since 2019, when it was loaded with rookies and young players, and learning a brand new scheme. Joe expects better next season. Much better. Otherwise it’s time for change.|2025-01-12 23:39:00|222|109|3|Soft Zone Polishes Off Season|Bucs defense struggles|5|Mixed sentiments on Bowles, calls for change due to defensive issues and coaching decisions.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Josh"", ""post"": ""FIRE BOWLES!!"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""12th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""11:39"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Mondy"", ""post"": ""Todd Bowles needs to be fired.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/long-offseason-ahead-for-baker-mayfield/|Long Offseason Ahead For Baker Mayfield|Baker Mayfield made plays tonight but he’ll be thinking for the next 7 1/2 months about his botched fourth-quarter handoff to Jalen McMillan at the Bucs’ 15 yard line. Fair or not, that lost fumble was the difference in the Bucs’ three-point loss. What a stain that puts on Mayfield’s extraordinary 2024 season. Joe actually thought the Bucs shouldn’t have gotten so cute in their own territory and just kept pounding the rock to Bucky Irving with a 17-13 lead on first down. But yeah, Joe’s nitpicking. The Bucs have run that jet-sweep play before and there was nothing wrong with the call. So how will Mayfield handle this kind of adversity? How will it drive him?

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/washington-23-buccaneers-20/|Washington 23, Buccaneers 20|This season is over, courtesy of tonight’s groin-stomp loss at home to the Commanders. And Joe believes these Bucs have a new identity: the first-half snooze.  Thankfully, it only lasted 28 minutes on this night. Finally the Bucs awakened with two minutes remaining in the first half, courtesy of an 18-yard, get-outta-my-damn-way run by Baker Mayfield on 3rd-and-7 from the Bucs’ 27 yard line. Hell of a play. Then Mike Evans took over and the Bucs scored a touchdown to tie the game at 10 at halftime. But that wasn’t enough to turn the tide. The Bucs got gifts from the Commanders but gave them all back. Joe tips a hat to Commanders coach Dan Quinn for turning down two very short field goals and failing on fourth down both times. That was the difference in the game … until Baker Mayfield coughed up the rock early in the fourth quarter at the Bucs’ 15 yard line on a botched handoff to Jalen McMillan. Four plays later, the Commanders were in the end zone with a 20-17 lead. Todd Bowles loves, loves, loves to talk about the evil of turnovers, and one of the worst kinds bit his Bucs in the ass tonight. The Bucs’ defense? It was better tonight, but ultimately, it was soft, soft, soft. They couldn’t get off the darn field as the Commanders won time of possession by a 10-minute margin. Washington did not punt and was 8-for-15 converting third downs. Joe is in pain. This was a very winnable game, but the Bucs lost. Todd Bowles will return next season, hopefully with a fresh injection of defensive talent and Liam Coen calling the plays on offense.|2025-01-12 23:08:00|281|287|2|Buccaneers|Buccaneers suffer disappointing loss due to turnovers and defensive struggles.|1|Overall, sentiment is negative with disappointment in Bowles and offensive mistakes noted.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Bucfanforever"", ""post"": ""This is the peak all you Bowles supporters.

Then watched 15 seconds run off the clock, before Mayfield realized they needed to call it at the end of the half.  And he refueses to accept that his defense is mediocre and continues to be ultra-conservative offensively.   Played for the tie (again) and it got us beat.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/zyon-mccollum-bucs-found-enjoyment-fun-in-late-november/|Zyon McCollum: Bucs “Found Enjoyment & Fun” In Late November|With the Bucs’ playoff game against the Commanders just hours away, cornerback Zyon McCollum offered a somewhat bizarre look into the psyche of the team. Hardcore soccer fans likely know talkSport if they follow the English game. That’s a website to turn to if you’re obsessed with Alejandro Garnacho’s next club, but talkSport has been dabbling more into NFL football and Joe’s enjoyed it. McCollum was a guest last week and he offered a surprising take on the Bucs’ collective mindset. Was there a mentality issue earlier this season? “After that bye, everybody got away from the [team] facility, kind of took some time with their families and, you know, just kind of found the enjoyment and the fun back in the game,” McCollum said. “And we came back full steam ahead. Since then, we’ve been on a really good run. Everything’s just starting to come together. “You know, guys are starting to do their jobs but also guys are starting to just buy in and just trust everyone — trust their teammates and trust the coaches. And it’s really starting to show, and it feels good when we’re out there, as well.” Well, it’s fantastic to hear the Bucs are buying in and the team feels great about its unity and their jobs. Perfect timing. But man, listening to McCollum, one could conclude the Bucs weren’t mentally in the right place before the Week 11 bye. Very strange for a team well stocked with veterans and a veteran coaching staff. McCollum also weighed in on tonight’s anticpated Mike Evans/Marshon Lattimore matchup. McCollum was clear that it’s a subject avoided in the Bucs’ locker room.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/report-tony-dungy-said-bucs-should-have-taken-a-knee-instead-of-extending-mike-evans-streak/|Report: Tony Dungy Said Bucs Should Have Taken A Knee Instead Of Extending Mike Evans’ Streak|Shame on Father Dungy. The Buccaneers Ring of Honor head coach (1996-2001) lives in Tampa and knows all about Mike Evans and all things Bucs, but it seems he still couldn’t pull himself from his conservative football roots last week. A member of the Sunday Night Football crew for NBC, Dungy often watches afternoon games with his NBC colleagues before the Sunday night broadcast. It seems that’s what happened a week ago. Fellow NBC analyst Rodney Harrison said he watched the game with Dungy and they had a disagreement about the Bucs throwing to extend Mike Evans’ record streak of 1,000-yard seasons. Taking a knee instead would have sealed a trip to the playoffs. “In that moment, Coach Dungy was saying, ‘Oh, no, you don’t give him the pass. There’s no way. It could be an interception,'” Harrison said on an NBC preview of tonight’s playoff game. “I said, ‘Coach, it’s bigger than that.’ I said, ‘It’s bigger than that. If they don’t get this man this record, this team is going to be affected by it. They know how hard [Evans] works, how much of a productive player he’s been. This is very important to that team.’ “And for them to get him that record and be that excited for him, that’s the culture that Todd Bowles has built.” Harrison went on to rant about how Bowles has built a true team and a dangerous team. “He continues to make them a competitive team that you have to respect.”|2025-01-12 09:43:00|250|72|3|Tony Dungy|Dungy disagrees on Bucs throwing for Mike Evans' streak extension.|7|Mixed feelings about Dungy's coaching style, but unity and milestone achievement are valued.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Colin in Canada"", ""post"": ""They are both correct.

I think he was 0-2. Dungy was 2-0 in playoff games at home(Detroit 1997, Washington 1999). Dungy Changed the franchise\u2019s trajectory, similar to how people have given Tom Brady credit for.

The NBC analyst couldn’t stop gushing about all things Irving during a sitdown with Mike Florio for a Sunday Night Football preview. Irving is a lot more than special rookie to Harrison. “I tell you man, this Bucky Irving is special,” Harrison said. “You start to look at him and the way he runs, he kind of reminds you of Bijan Robinson a little bit, kind of Barry Sanders the way he jump cuts and he’s very patient. He’s just a really good dynamic player. And really smart move by [the Bucs] moving him to running back No. 1 because it just wasn’t cutting it with Rachaad White.” Harrison isn’t a hot-take guy and he’s also been watching Irving a long time. It turns out Harrison played for the same youth football club in Illinois (30 years later). Joe is so fired up for tonight, in part because Irving has a chance to take his newfound fame to a new level with postseason success.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/bucs-offense-improved-since-week-1-too/|Bucs Offense Improved Since Week 1, Too|Joe has mentioned this on the “Ira Kaufman Podcast” and a couple of times on this here website. Joe’s worn out hearing about how Commandos quarterback Jayden Daniels is so much better now than when he faced the Bucs in Week 1 and as a result, Daniels is going to roast the Bucs like a Thanksgiving turkey. Hey, Joe agrees Daniels is a better quarterback. But guess who else is better? The Bucs offense. Like Washington, the Bucs, too, had a brand new offensive coordinator. And, like Washington, the Bucs were also breaking in a rookie. That would be Bucky Irving. He had only nine carries in Week 1. He should double that tonight. So the suggestion that Daniels will be unstoppable because he’s improved since Week 1 is just a one-way outlook. “The offense has come together as the season has come along,” Bucs right tackle Luke Goedeke told Joe last week. “I think our offense has developed.” Yes, the whole offense. Everyone is now good with Bucs offensive coordinator Liam Coen’s offense. And receiver Jalen McMillan and Bucky are two of the best rookies in the NFL now. Yeah, along with Daniels. “Numbers speak for themselves,” Goedeke said of the Bucs’ run game, No. 4 in the NFL. “We have communication up front [on the line which has improved]. Just all 11 guys are trusting the process and doing their job. “Bucky, Rachaad [White] and Tuck [Sean Tucker] are really running hard. We knew what we were capable of [with the run game]. It was just a matter of [Coen] setting us up and putting us in the right position.” Two new starters, left guard Ben Bredeson and center Graham Barton, have had their rough patches smoothed out and as a result, the offensive line is a solid unit. “You have bumps and bruises but we are healthy,” Goedeke said of the line. “You develop more continuity along the whole offensive line [over time]. That only helps. “You get more confidence. You’ve seen everything that someone could possibly throw at you [by Week 18]. That just helps.” How good does Goedeke think the Bucs’ offensive line is? “I would put it up against any line in the NFL,” he said. So when you hear all the pregame shows today rattle off the tired and copied lines that the Bucs defense will struggle because Daniels has grown as a quarterback since facing the Bucs in September, remember the Bucs also have an offense that has grown and matured in that same time frame. The Bucs, with a running attack that was finding its footing back in Week 1 ran for 112 yards against the Commandos that day. And Baker Mayfield threw for 289 yards and four touchdowns.|2025-01-12 01:17:00|458|26|8|Bucs Offense|Bucs offense has improved significantly since Week 1.|6|Mixed sentiment with some optimism and some concerns about the team's performance.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Mac"", ""post"": ""Hey Joe any chance you could run a story on how Bucky got his nickname.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/playoffs-really-are-more-intense/|Playoffs Really Are More Intense|Joe has heard a lot about how playoff games are more intense than regular season games. Joe has always been suspicious of this. It’s almost like saying dudes take off plays in the regular season or that guys aren’t giving their all and saving themselves for the playoffs — if they get to the playoffs. So Joe asked around the Bucs’ locker room to get young players’ take on playoff intensity and regular season intensity. Bucs defensive tackle Calijah Kancey said playoff games are ramped up more than regular season games because of what is at stake. But he told Joe that doesn’t mean he drags his tail in the regular season. “It is pretty much the same for me,” Kancey said. “We just know that the next game [in the playoffs] is not promised. “Not saying that guys are not going to give it all they have or leave it all on the field in the regular season, but [the playoffs] is do-or-die. Intensity is way higher. “The win-or-go-home nature of the playoffs energizes players, Kancey said. “The playoffs actually gives you extra juice to go out there and make more plays,” Kancey said. “Make sure you come out with a win. Once you are in the playoffs, anything can happen.” K.J. Britt said knowing the team will be different is a motivating factor. There is natural attrition every year and no guarantee the Bucs will be stronger next year, so this may be some players’ last chance. “This team will never be the same,” Britt said. “This is the only time the team will be like this. You will have another team [next season] that you try to make your own. So, you don’t want to go home. You have to play.” Bucs coach Dirk Koetter used to say rosters usually change by 30 percent from one year to the next. Guys get traded, cut, replaced or they retire; new draft picks come in. Joe remembers last year there was a Pat O’Connor jersey draped over the chair at Lavonte David’s locker with a long farewell message. It hit Joe: O’Connor was in a contract year. David debated retiring. Aside from maybe a Bucs’ Super Bowl reunion, it is likely O’Connor (who is on the Lions roster) and David are teammates again. “You never know when one play will determine a football game,” Britt said of the intensity of the playoffs. “You have to play each and every play because you just don’t know what play [can win a game or end a season].” So that’s one reason players ball out in January and you hear how playoff games are more intense. Lose now,and you don’t know what the future will hold maybe never playing in a playoff game again.|2025-01-12 00:03:00|462|3|7|Playoff Intensity|Players embrace higher stakes and intensity of playoff games.|4|Mixed feelings about player changes and uncertainties but hopeful and passionate about team representation.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""heyjude"", ""post"": ""So true.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/advantage-jalen-mcmillan/|Advantage: Jalen McMillan|Few receivers not named “Ja’Marr Chase” ended the season hotter than Bucs rookie wideout Jalen McMillan. McMillan finished with touchdowns in five straight games. That’s rare, especially for rookies. In those games, McMillan racked up seven touchdowns. With McMillan being hotter than a July Bucs training camp practice, and so many folks expecting Commandos cornerback Marshon Lattimore and Bucs receiver Mike Evans to spar throughout tonight’s game, that may take attention away from McMillan. If that happens, X’s and O’s guy Matt Bowen of BSPN says McMillan will light up Washington. Matchup X factor: Buccaneers wide receiver Jalen McMillan. He has seen a bump in target volume and more touchdown production down the stretch. McMillan has at least one touchdown reception in each of his past five games, and he brings a vertical stretch element to this offense. Working opposite Mike Evans, McMillan can win his matchups against Washington’s other options in the secondary. So in Joe’s mind, Joe almost encourages Washington to try to blanket Evans with Lattimore. That way the Bucs can take advantage of lesser defensive backs. And as Joe mentioned on the “Ira Kaufman Podcast,” are we really to believe that Bucs offensive coordinator Liam Coen can’t figure out a way to scheme up a play or two for Evans away from Lattimore?|2025-01-12 00:02:00|217|22|10|Jalen McMillan|Hot streak makes him key matchup against Washington.|5|Mixed sentiment with concerns about players' performances, but also optimism for offensive success and motivation.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Buddha"", ""post"": ""Lattimore is not the player he was.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/forcing-washington-into-third-downs/|Weird Jayden Daniels Stat Bucs May Flaunt|Load up the end zone. That’s one way Joe would defend Jayden Daniels, the Commandos sensational rookie quarterback. In one of the weirdest stats Joe has read, Daniels really likes throwing into the end zone. That’s not really a bad thing but Daniels does not rely on his wide receivers to get YAC to score. Hardly ever, as documented by Rich Hribar of Sharp Football Analysis. Daniels has only 3 passing touchdowns on throws that were run in by the pass catcher and not thrown into the end zone. Only Trevor Lawrence (2) and Cooper Rush (1) had fewer. Neither played the entire season. So what would Joe do? Well, probably load the end zone if the Commandos get in the red zone. Of course, that likely could be a problem. More guys on the back end means that’s likely more of an opportunity to let Daniels run the ball in himself.|2025-01-12 00:01:00|152|8|5|Jayden Daniels|Rookie QB's unique end zone throwing tendencies.|5|Mixed sentiment with a mix of optimism and intensity in comments related to sports.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Mac"", ""post"": ""Man I am jacked and nervous. 24 hours from now I will either be too jacked to sleep or too depressed.

So from the left side he mostly will run  to the left or hand off to the running back. The left side is mostly the weak side of most of his formations. A great example of this is the Mariota run vs. Cowboys. No need to roll out and pass to the left when you can easily run from that left side or also Scary Terry  lines up mostly on the left running posts or corner routes.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/gameday-tampa-bay-319/|GameDay Tampa Bay|Wild Card Round Commandos (12-5) at Bucs (10-7) Kickoff: 8 p.m. TV: NBC (WFLA-TV Channel 8, locally) with Mike Tirico, Cris Collinsworth and Carrie Underwood.  Streaming: NFL+, Peacock. (Geographic restrictions apply; subscription may be required). Radio: Buccaneers Radio Network WXTB-FM 97.9 in the Tampa-St. Petersburg region (Transmisiones de radio en español en WTMP-FM 96.1 y WMGG-AM 1470 en Tampa). Additional stations throughout Florida on the Buccaneers Radio Network can be found here. The game also will be broadcast on SiriusXM Channel 225 (Buccaneers Radio Network feed). Westwood One national feed on SiriusXM NFL Radio Channel 88. Weather: Tailgaters won’t have it too bad, per AccuWeather.com. Temperatures will hover in the 60s under sunny skies in the afternoon. But that will drop quickly once the sun goes down. At kickoff, look for a temperature of 56 dropping to 52 by game’s end. Odds: Per Hard Rock Bet, as of midnight, Bucs -3 (-170); over/under 50. Referees: Craig Wrolstad and his gang will work the game. This outfit plays it right down the middle. Home teams when Wrolstad’s gang works are 63-63. Injuries: Commandos — Out: TE Colson Yankoff (hamstring).  Doubtful: WR Jamison Crowder (hamstring). Bucs — Out: CB Troy Hill (knee/foot). Questionable: CB Jamel Dean (knee), S Mike Edwards (quad), DL Logan Hall (groin), TE Cade Otton (knee). Outlook: Playoffs, baby! Here we are. NBC. Prime time. Mike Tirico. Cris Collinsworth. Carrie Underwood. Big time! Now if the Bucs defense can only play morning TV. If the Bucs get any kind of defense today, they should win. The Commandos don’t have a great defense and their run defense is terrible. The Bucs’ running game is fantastic. Joe is tired of hearing about how good Commandos quarterback Jayden Daniels is. Oh, he’s good, but everybody and their brother is claiming he’s so much better than he was in his very first NFL game, a Bucs win where he was held him to 184 yards passing. Well, guess what else is better? The Bucs offense. The Bucs were breaking in a brand new offense in Week 1 and the offensive line wasn’t yet gelled. Another thing to keep in mind: Bucky Irving, also a rookie, was playing in his first NFL game and he only had nine carries in that game. He may have 20 tonight. Oh, lastly about Daniels: Only three rookie quarterbacks have ever won a road playoff game. The last was Russell Wilson in 2012. If the same Bucs defense that showed up in Los Angeles to curb stomp the Chargers shows up tonight, the Bucs have this game, man. Fun facts: Commandos QB Jayden Daniels had the most rushing yards (891), highest completion percentage (69 pct.), third-most wins (12), fourth-most passing and rushing yards combined (4,459), fourth-most passing and rushing touchdowns combined (31) and sixth-most touchdown passes in NFL history for a rookie. He had 184 passing yards against the Bucs in the Week 1 meeting, his first NFL game. … In five of his six road games this season, RB Austin Ekeler had at least 50 yards from scrimmage. … In his lone playoff game which came against the Bucs four years ago, WR Terry McLaurin had 6 catches for 75 yards. … TE Zach Ertz has at least 5 catches for at least 50 yards receiving in four of his past six playoff games. … LB Bobby Wagner averages 10 tackles a game in his 16 playoff games. … DE Dante Fowler led the Commandos with 14 tackles for loss this season. … S Jeremy Chinn had a career-high 7 tackles for loss and five passes defended in 2024. … Bucs QB Baker Mayfield finished the 2024 regular season tied for second in touchdown passes (career-high 41) and completions (career-high 407) and third in passing yards (career-high 4,500). … RB Bucky Irving led all rookies in scrimmage yards (1,514), rushing yards (1,122) and rushing touchdowns (8). He also became the first rookie running back since 2018 (Saquon Barkley) with three games of 150+ scrimmage yards. … WR Mike Evans has 25 catches for 547 yards (109.4 per game) and six receiving touchdowns in five career games against the Commandos. He also had two touchdown catches in the Week 1 meeting. … WR Jalen McMillan has a current five-game streak with at least one touchdown pass. … LB Lavonte David was the only player this year with 100 tackles (122), 5 sacks (5.5), 5 tackles for loss (9) and five passes defensed (6), his 12th-career 100+ tackle season. David will turn 35 in 11 days. … DT Calijah Kancey led the Bucs with a career-high 13 tackles for loss this season including a crazy four tackles for loss last week against the slimy Saints. … CB Zyon McCollum was third in the NFL with 17 passes defensed.|2025-01-12 00:00:00|799|19|9|GameDay Tampa Bay|Bucs favored to win Wild Card Round game.|6|Mixed sentiments with some optimism but also negative comments on commentators.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""unbelievable"", ""post"": ""Pretty much perfect football weather.
