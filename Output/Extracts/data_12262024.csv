https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/the-jets-and-liam-coen/|The Jets And Liam Coen|The drumbeat for Liam Coen is getting louder outside Tampa. The Buccaneers’ playcaller is a hot head coaching name, one that’s found its way to the mess of an organization that is the New York Jets and their disgusted fans. Has it really been 14 years since Rex Ryan had the Jets in the AFC championship game in back-to-back seasons? The Jets haven’t been in the postseason since that 2010 campaign and have just one winning record in those 14 seasons (Todd Bowles, 2015). Not only is New York sports media legend Mike Francesa, “The Pope,” barking for weeks that the Jets should hire Coen, NFL Network insider and Good Morning Football co-host Peter Schrager was on the air recently referencing how Jets and Bears fans are pounding a drum for Coen. Of course, the Jets don’t know who their general manager or 2025 quarterback will be, but that hasn’t stunted cries for Coen. Interesting to Joe was longtime Tampa multimedia czar J.P. Peterson appearing on Good Morning Football last week and insisting to the panel that Coen will stay in Tampa for the 2025 season. He was adamant that Team Glazer will make sure it happens. Hot take? Joe has no clue, but Peterson said on those NFL Network airwaves that Buccaneers business front man Brian Ford, officially the team chief operating officer, gave him a jersey to wear for the appearance. So perhaps Peterson has fresh intel. Joe wrote long ago that Team Glazer should pay Coen not to interview for a head coaching job in the 2025 hiring cyle. Coen has to have a price. What goes down doesn’t have to be made public. Of course, that assumes Todd Bowles is the Bucs’ head coach next season, a thought that troubles a lot of Bucs fans on this fine day after Christmas.|2024-12-26 16:14:00|305|52|4|Liam Coen|Jets fans hopeful but uncertain about potential coaching hire.|2|Mixed sentiments leaning negative on Jets, Bears coaching situations, uncertain about Coen's prospects.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""TheBucsAnthem"", ""post"": ""Anyone taking a coaching job with the Jets or Bears are just asking career ending job/decision\u2026\u2026 those two franchises are hopeless due to incompetent owners."", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""26th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""4:18"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""SlyPirate"", ""post"": ""TheBucsAnthem Says: Jets or Bears are career ending job/decision"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""26th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""4:25"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""Buccaneer Bonzai"", ""post"": ""Fire Bowles.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/dave-canales-on-mike-evans-its-a-patience-game/|Dave Canales On Mike Evans: “It’s A Patience Game”|So 2023 Bucs playcaller and current Panthers head coach Dave Canales was asked a heck of a simple question this week. It was about Mike Evans: “How do you stop that guy?” The query came from retired stud Carolina linebacker Thomas Davis (2005-2020) via the official Panthers website. Canales didn’t answer the question, perhaps because there is no answer. But Canales did give a great take of what makes Evans successful. “He’s so comfortable with double coverage because he’s really gotten that really from about his third year in the league on,” Canales said. “People are thinking about him — a cornerback low, a safety over the top, a safety low, a corner high, a [linebacker], whatever it is.  So he’s used to playing the different leverages that come with double coverage and trying to still find his way to get open by the end of the play. … “It’s a patience game with Mike. He just, he knows that defenses are going to be thinking about him. And then he’s just going to like stay consistent and have the right mindset. So that when he does get that access, or he does get that 1-on-1 matchup, he’s still there [mentally]. He’s not frustrated about it. He’s still present, so he can still make his plays.” Well said. It is remarkable how steady Evans has been and how he he doesn’t act like a frustrated diva receiver when he doesn’t get the football — for whatever reason. If Evans starts to get annoyed (Joe believes a touch of that peeked out against the Raiders), Evans seem to kill it in a hurry — way before the next snap. As for Evans against the Panthers on Sunday, Joe thinks the Panthers will give Evans a decent share of single coverage. Jaycee Horn is a quality cornerback and Michael Jackson opposite him is playing with a lot of confidence. Joe sure hopes that happens. Single coverage is Evans’ best shot at huge gains, and he needs 182 yards to hit 1,000 yards receiving for the 11th consecutive season.|2024-12-26 14:47:00|346|26|7|Dave Canales|Mike Evans excels in patience and consistency against double coverage.|7|Fans express optimism for Mike Evans' performance, prioritizing wins and record-breaking achievements.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Watch More All-22 Before Commenting"", ""post"": ""The way to stop Mike Evans is to put him in a run-first Coen offense.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/the-todd-bowles-nick-saban-approach/|The Todd Bowles-Nick Saban Approach|So the Bucs have a seasoned Nick Saban/Bruce Arians/Todd Bowles guy on staff.  Assistant secondary coach Rashad Johnson is in his third year with the Bucs after being an All-American safety at Alabama with Saban, then playing for Arians and Bowles in Arizona. He moved on to the Titans in 2016 before retiring and spending years in the media. (Joe loves that.). Johnson interned with the Bucs’ coaching staff in 2022 and was hired soon after. Johnson, obviously, doesn’t do many interviews, but he was a quality guest on the Buccaneers Radio Network this week. Are the Bucs playing with must-win, postseason kind of urgency now? No such thing, says Johnson. Approaching every game the same is critical. They’re all in the must-win category. “That’s something that I learned in college with Coach Saban; that’s something that I was reminded of with Bruce Arians and here with Todd Bowles, as well,” Johnson said. “During my time and tenure [with Bowles], you know, we approach every game the same. It’s not a playoff game at the end of the season; it’s a playoff game in September. You gotta win in September for them to matter in December. … They’re all playoff games.” Johnson’s comments further explain why Bowles said he doesn’t feel compelled to talk to his team about everything being on the line against Carolina on Sunday. “Not quitting” is key, Johnson added, which is a common comment by longtime NFL players. Veteran players have seen guys take their foot off the gas for a play or two or more, and collectively that can be a problem. Just imagine if Anthony Nelson wasn’t locked in four weeks ago against Carolina. So Bucs coaches will keep grinding away on the basics and let players push themselves to raise their games Sunday to a level of consistency and intelligence worthy of a playoff contender.|2024-12-26 13:59:00|312|31|7|Rashad Johnson|Bucs' approach to games with playoff urgency.|1|Mixed sentiment with some criticism and positivity towards the team and coaching staff.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Buc4evr"", ""post"": ""Their backs are against the wall and it\u2019s business as usual.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/liam-coen-addresses-weird-scoring-first-streak/|Liam Coen Addresses Weird Scoring-First Streak|This is weird to Joe and Bucs offensive coordinator Liam Coen seconded the strange numbers. Despite the Bucs having one of the best offenses in the league, the Bucs cannot seem to overcome 3-0 deficits like last Sunday in Dallas. The Bucs this season are 8-1 when they score first. When the Bucs do not score first, they are winless. Coen, in his weekly press conference today, stated he wasn’t even aware of that stat until earlier this week. He swore the weird stat is not because the Bucs panic or throw in the towel if the opponent happens to put points on the board first. “That doesn’t mean the game is over because we didn’t start fast,” Coen said. “I don’t think our players feel that way. Guess you could say it looks that way on paper. “But I don’t think that is the way it is. It was just one of those games [Sunday]. … It’s not something that we feel as a group or anybody panics when that occurs. It’s one of those things.” If anything, Coen noted, this is a point that Coen can and may use to motivate his offense. “Definitely something we can continue to hammer home with the guys and continue to be more accountable too, and diligent. “Keep playing. Keep playing to the next play and see what happens. Play your tail off till the whistle blows at the end of the game.” To add to the weirdness of this stat, the Bucs last year had an offense that never scored a touchdown on its opening drive — yet that team was one a cat’s whisker away from the NFC title game. This year with a high-powered offense, the Bucs struggle to climb over a 3-0 deficit.|2024-12-26 13:17:00|295|7|5|Liam Coen|Bucs struggle to overcome 3-0 deficits despite strong offense.|3|Mixed sentiments regarding team performance, with concerns about defense and offense strategies highlighted.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""unbelievable"", ""post"": ""It really is bizarre.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/how-desperate-are-the-bucs-for-an-edge-rush/|How Desperate Are The Bucs For An Edge Rush?|Joe doesn’t believe Bucs coaches care about an edge rush. Joe was sitting just feet away from defensive line coach Kacy Rodgers last month when he openly said the Bucs don’t care where sacks come from. That’s OK on paper, just like how BSPN analytics always says “go for it” on fourth downs. Edge rushers are critical for a solid defense. All Joe will suggest is that this century when the Bucs had a tremendous edge rush, they won Super Bowls. (The Bucs organization clearly cares about an edge rush because look at the draft capital the Bucs have spent on edge rushers the past four years.) Joe brings all of this up because, per NFL uber insider Adam Schefter, the Dolphins plan to release former Bucs sack king Shaq Barrett. Shaq signed with the Dolphins in March but announced his retirement in July. Back in August, Shaq told Kay Adams he would only return to the NFL to play for the Bucs. Shaq was even seen on video at the opening of a Bucs-themed sports bar near Marienplaz in Munich (which serves Killians — in Munich of all places!) where he said he would only play with Tampa Bay. But Shaq’s agent, oily Drew Rosenhaus, somehow coaxed the Dolphins into releasing him. Provided Shaq clears waivers on Friday, Shaq, in theory, could return to the Bucs. So how desperate are the Bucs for an edge rush? Joe would suggest they are very desperate. Bucs backup outside linebacker Anthony Nelson leads all outside linebackers/edge rushers with three sacks! Joe Tryon-Shoyinka, YaYa Diaby and Nelson, combined, have seven sacks total. That is flat-out embarrassing for a professional football franchise.|2024-12-26 11:11:00|278|50|7|Bucs|Bucs are very desperate for an edge rush.|2|Mixed reactions to edge rush situation, advocating for signing players, criticism of coaching and management.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Ds"", ""post"": ""The edge rush in the loss decade was better then this lol and that\u2019s says alot"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""26th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""11:19"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Joe in Michigan"", ""post"": ""What, to put the old man out in coverage?

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/two-more-wounded-animals/|“Two More Wounded Animals”|Bucco Bruce Arians is quick to say a lot of players on losing teams mentally check out right after Thanksgiving. Todd Bowles and one of his former Bucs have other ideas. Tampa Bay has “two more wounded animals” on their schedule in the Panthers (Sunday at The Licht House) and slimy Saints. Ex-Bucs safety Logan Ryan, who also spent a combined 10 years with the Belicheats, Titans, Giants and 49ers, was adamant that loser teams playing out a schedule are very dangerous. It doesn’t matter if their minds are also on vacation. “You don’t know what you’re going to defend when a team’s got Mexico or Cancun coming up,” Ryan said on SiriusXM NFL Radio. Ryan noted that players playing more freely and coaches taking chances can be a brutal combination. He pointed directly at Carolina as an example. “When you take pressure and expecations off some of these players and these organizations, look how much better they perform,” Ryan said, naming Bryce Young and the Panthers as a team in that boat, along with the Cowboys club that just beat the Bucs. Per Ryan, those are likely to be overrated teams coming opening day of the 2025 season. Ryan later interviewed Bucs head coach Todd Bowles on the same broadcast and Bowles absolutely agreed with Ryan when it comes to the unpredictability of teams already out of playoff contention being a tougher out. Joe gets it, but damn, reality has to rule the day. Joe is so glad the Bucs (8-7) are playing Carolina (4-11) on Sunday while the Falcons (8-7) head to Washington (10-5) on Sunday night.|2024-12-26 11:00:00|269|18|7|Bucco Bruce Arians|Late-season danger for teams out of playoff contention.|3|Mixed sentiments with some optimism and hope, but mostly criticism and skepticism.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Ed"", ""post"": ""There are a couple of trends I would like to see the Bucs put behind them:"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""26th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""11:22"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Saskbucs"", ""post"": ""Maybe a super aggressive and fast start would help that.

Plug-and-play defensive back Christian Izien was placed on injured reserve this morning with a pec injury, per Scott Smith of Buccaneers.com. Izien suffered the injury in the galling loss to Dallas on Sunday. The move means Izien must sit out no less than four games. Given the Bucs have two games left in the regular season, that means the earliest the Bucs can get Izien back on the field would be the NFC title game. The way the Bucs played at Dallas on Sunday night, does that possibility seem real?

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/audition-week-for-liam-coen/|Audition Week For Liam Coen|So a lot of NFL owners, possibly even Team Glazer, want to see what Bucs offensive coordinator Liam Coen does Sunday in a high-pressure game against the NFL-worst Panthers defense. A hot name withing NFL head coach chatter, Coen will have a Pro Bowl quarterback, an elite running back, a Hall of Fame receiver and a stout offensive line at his disposal. After what should be a hearty “thank you” to Buccaneers Ring of Honor general manager Jason Licht for securing all those tools, Coen should go out and punish the Panthers. Frankly, Coen’s 2025 future options could be on the line. Yes, Coen’s runs an offense ranked No. 5 in scoring, No. 3 in yards, No. 3 in first downs, No. 3 in yards per carry and No. 4 in touchdowns, but the NFL is and can be the ultimate what-have-you-done-for-me-lately league. If Coen’s unit drops a clunker on Sunday, then his head-coach stock (whatever that may or may not be) could plummet at the worst time for his career. Think about it, a 24-12 Bucs loss (football gods forbid) would let a lot of air out of Coen’s balloon. So Joe sees Sunday as the game of Coen’s young playcalling career. Some Bucs fans are weighing a desire for Coen to replace Todd Bowles after this season. Joe doesn’t stand on that line of the sand on Dec. 26. But it’s fair to say Bowles is on trial in this critical game, and so is his offensive coordinator.|2024-12-26 10:03:00|250|27|8|Liam Coen|High-pressure game for Bucs offensive coordinator against NFL-worst Panthers defense.|2|Varied opinions on coaching changes, dissatisfaction with defense, concerns about team performance.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""SB~LV"", ""post"": ""The release of the notion of TB resigning was very curious\u2026."", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""26th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""10:23"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Pewter Power"", ""post"": ""Nah I think some teams like the giants are so desperate they already have this guy penciled in.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/baker-mayfield-discusses-preparing-for-stinking-panthers/|Baker Mayfield Discusses Prep For Stinking Panthers|So Tuesday was Baker Mayfield’s day of the week to speak to the local pen and mic club. And he shared interesting analysis of preparing to play the Bucs’ last two opponents of the regular season, the Stinking Panthers and the slimy Saints. If you read between the lines, Mayfield seems a tad more concerned about the slimy Saints than the Stinking Panthers. Basically, Mayfield said, teams change over the course of a season, not so much over the course of a month. The Bucs beat the Panthers in overtime on Dec. 1. “Sometimes when you play a team early in the year compared to – like our Saints game this year, we [played] them early, we play them [the] last game — sometimes you can change schematically,” Mayfield said. “When it’s this quick of a turnaround in between games with division opponents, you really don’t see that much. “I mean there might be some personnel changes that could change some things. But really, it’s about the little details. It’s kind of like a Thursday night week of who’s going to execute better.” Makes sense. The Bucs and slimy Saints are a different teams than when they played in Week 6. Joe wonders if the Bucs are already doing some homework on New Orleans for Week 18. But if the Bucs don’t take care of business Sunday, they may not have to worry about the slimy Saints.|2024-12-26 04:50:00|237|11|5|Baker Mayfield|Mayfield analyzes upcoming games vs. Panthers and Saints.|4|Mixed sentiments with concerns about game performance and execution issues.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Jeff"", ""post"": ""Baker, bro, sleep in a separate room and get some real shut-eye."", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""26th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""7:19"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""BucfaninMi"", ""post"": ""Just win both."", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""26th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""8:25"", ""am""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""firethecannons"", ""post"": ""Saints just lost a game on prime time by scoring zero points.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/panthers-are-1-5-on-the-road/|Panthers Are 1-5 On The Road|People keep telling Joe that the Panthers, with the NFL’s worst defense and a 4-11 record, are a quality football team that poses a lot of danger. Those folks point to Carolina having a lot of one-score losses recently. You know what kind of team racks up one-score losses? A bad team. A team that doesn’t know how to win. Joe survived The Lost Decade of Buccaneers football. So Joe is familiar with one-score losses — and how coaches and management types like to make a case that a team is close to being special because it’s losing tight games. Dirk Koetter’s Buccaneers were 7-14 in one-score games in his final two seasons (2017-2018). Bucco Bruce Arians then took over in 2019 and went 3-6 in one-score games. All were losing seasons. Ironically, the Bucs are 2-5 this season in one-score games, but they’re sporting an 8-7 record. Joe’s message? The tight-games argument is highly flawed. Carolina is a threat to the Bucs on Sunday for one reason only. Because Bryce Young showed he could carve up the Bucs’ zone defense in their Week 13 matchup, an overtime win for Tampa Bay. If Todd Bowles adjusts his defense plays less zone, then this game shouldn’t be close. And as Joe noted in the headline, the Panthers are 1-5 on the road this season.|2024-12-26 04:45:00|223|22|4|Panthers|Panthers' poor road record raises doubts about their quality team status.|2|Pessimistic outlook regarding team performance and coaching decisions.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Mike C"", ""post"": ""If Todd Bowles can figure out the FUNDAMENTALS of time management, maybe the Bucs have a shot."", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""26th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""5:01"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Jack Burton Mercer"", ""post"": ""Our zone is the easiest defense to diagnose in the entire league.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/mina-kimes-bucs-defense-will-doom-the-team/|Mina Kimes: Bucs Defense Will Doom The Team|Mina Kines made her prediction. The BSPN NFL analyst had harsh but fair words for Bucs coach Todd Bowles. She said every minute his defense is on the field, the chance increases that the Bucs will miss the playoffs. And if the Bucs do make it to the playoffs, Kimes predicted the defense will see to it the Bucs are one-and-done. In short, Kimes is horrified by the Bucs’ pass defense and busted out laughing while chatting about it with colleague Ben Solak. “It’s bad,” Kimes said. “The pass defense is just awful. There are guys wide open all of the time (laughs). They are very open.” How bad? How open? Bowles will have to figure out a way for his offense either to go Air Coryell and light up the scoreboard, she said, or the Bucs will have to play keepaway in an effort to hide the defense. “If this team makes it to the playoffs, they will not win a playoff game if Todd Bowles plays it super conservatively,” Kimes said. “He has to recognize — and I know he is a defensive coach — he knows his defense isn’t it. “Call the game aggressively. Keep your offense on the field. Do whatever it takes to keep your offense on the field.” Kimes made her remarks in the wake of Troy Aikman Cooper Rush ripping apart the Bucs in the first half on Sunday. Kimes also recalled Kirk Cousins going absolutely bonkers with 500 yards passing in one of his two big passing games on the Bucs. Yeah, that Kirk Cousins. The same Kirk Cousins who was benched by the Dixie Chicks last week. The current NFC South-leading Dixie Chicks. When is the last time you saw a team in a playoff chase with three games left (at the time) bench its healthy starting quarterback? Yet he put up 500 yards on the Bucs. Kimes had a kind request for Bowles to perhaps save the Bucs’ season. “Coach the team like you know your defense sucks.”|2024-12-26 04:00:00|338|39|2|Mina Kimes|Harsh critique of Bucs defense|4|Mixed opinions on Todd Bowles and defense.

Irving hammered away at Carolina for 25 carries, 152 yards and a touchdown. It was the rookie’s biggest breakout game as a professional. And now the Panthers are coming to Tampa on Sunday for a must-win game at The Licht House. As he should be, Tampa Bay head coach Todd Bowles is smitten with his running back. “His vision and his cutability is outstanding. He can see the holes. He’s hungry,” Bowles told the Buccaneers Radio Network this week. “He has great contact balance and he’s a very good inside zone runner.” Joe will casually throw in that Irving leads the NFL with the highest catch rate in the league. He’s caught 41 of 43 balls in his direction. Joe loves how Bowles isn’t shy about throwing major love at his star running back. Now Joe wants to see the Bucs give Irving another 25 touches on Sunday.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/mike-evans-dominates/|Mike Evans Dominates|If you believe these numbers (the source is sketchy), Bucs’ future Hall of Fame receiver Mike Evans is having an insanely good season. The data for the chart below shows Evans is playing in his own football world and the rest of the NFL is along for the ride. By way of analyst Judah Fortgang, the numbers are cobbled together using reliable data and splashes of the nonsense PFF tribe grades. (NFL folks think those “grades” are total trash and so should you.) The chart demonstrates Evans, at the age of 31, is Mossing the rest the league as far as getting open, getting separation and YAC. (Remember when some used to kvetch about Evans’ YAC?) Knowing how Evans is atop the league at getting open, did missing Evans for three games this season, specifically against the Chiefs and 49ers, cost the Bucs a win? Remember, the Bucs took the Chiefs to overtime and the 49ers won on a last-second field goal when the Bucs couldn’t score a game-winning touchdown and had to settle for a tying field goal.|2024-12-26 03:45:00|179|8|8|Mike Evans|Dominant season|5|Mixed sentiments about Mike Evans' usage and impact on the team's performance.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Surfslowson"", ""post"": ""Jalen McMillan is doing well at separating too, but Evans is dominanting"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""26th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""3:54"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""HomerSimpsonRocks"", ""post"": ""Throw the ball to Mike.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/todd-bowles-vita-vea-having-his-best-season/|Todd Bowles: Vita Vea Having His Best Season|Joe notices several commenters who gripe on this here site that beastly Pro Bowl defensive tackle Vita Vea sometimes takes games off. Some games Vea is a wrecking ball. Other times, commenters type, Vea goes into hibernation. Well, Bucs coach Todd Bowles doesn’t want to hear any of that smack. Tuesday, Bowles told the gathered Tampa Bay pen and mic club that Vea has been an absolute force this year. In fact, Bowles added he doesn’t believe he’s seen the Pro Bowler play better. “I think it’s probably the best year I’ve seen him have since I’ve been here, and this is my sixth year having him,” Bowles said. “From coming back in shape to playing hard every week to using his hands more and becoming more of an unstoppable force.” Well, this comment makes Joe wonder if Vea wasn’t always fully buying in. Why else cite how he came into training camp in shape? Why mention how he’s now using his hands more — unless he wasn’t previously in shape and wasn’t previously coached to use his hands? Bowles continued bragging about Vea. “He used to just use brute strength without using technique, and then he’d get stuck a few times, but right now, he’s got the whole gamut working,” Bowles said. “He drops [into coverage] once or twice when we ask him to, he rushes the passer well when they single him, he plays the run, he causes havoc inside. Between all the records and everything, he’s having a heck of a year.” Joe thought NBC and PFF tribe-owning Cris Collinsworth captured Bucs’ fans feelings Sunday night when Vea damn near saved the game against the Cowboys. Collinsworth said when he sees tackles drop back into coverage, he moans. But because of that (an accident?) Vea was able to make a bone-crushing tackle to force the Cowboys off the field and give the ball back to the Bucs. Joe’s guessing when Dallas tight end Jake Ferguson got splattered by Vea, he wondered what model Ford pickup from Bill Currie Ford hit him.|2024-12-26 00:00:00|344|10|7|Vita Vea|Todd Bowles praises Vea's exceptional performance this season.|3|Mixed opinions on coach and defense performance, criticized Bowles, praised player fundamentals.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Jethro Tull"", ""post"": ""And with a better coach Vita is a look Hall of Famer."", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""26th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""12:09"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Pewter Power"", ""post"": ""Wow he must have good fundamentals.
