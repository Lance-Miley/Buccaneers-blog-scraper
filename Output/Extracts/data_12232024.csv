https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/pro-bowl-safety-ex-qb-blast-bucs-defensive-plan/|Pro Bowl Safety, Ex-QB Blast Bucs’ Defensive Plan|A couple of heavy hitters in NFL media had quite an exchange as they ganged up on Buccaneers defensive guru head coach Todd Bowles. Thirteen years as a New England safety, with Pro Bowls and Super Bowl rings to his name, makes Devin McCourty qualified to assess defense, and he doesn’t like or fully understand what Bowles has been doing with his. That was his firm message on NBC’s Unbuttoned podcast with former Bucs QB Chris Simms. McCourty said Bowles is not all about adjustments and crafting defenses to an opponent like Bill Belicheat was. And McCourty isn’t a fan. Simms got after Bowles in a hurry blasting the Tampa Bay defense with foul language. Joe will pick it up after that. Chris Simms: … The defense and Cooper Rush and this Cowboys offense isn’t supposed to get 311 yards on you if you’re a playoff football team and you expect to win playoff football games. … How many five-man fronts? They were playing defense like they were playing Emmitt Smith and Troy Aikman back in the day. Like Larry Allen might pull and they’re going to smash it. No! [The Cowboys’] run game has been good as of late, but I’d be more worried about fu**’n Cooper Rush and Cee Dee Lamb. … All they do is design offense around Cee Dee Lamb. Devin McCourty: Heavy Cee Dee Lamb. Simms: They let him be man-to-man all game long and all they do is design offense for Cee Dee Lamb and of course he torched [the Bucs]. And that was a big part of it. I do no trust the Bucs defense. McCourty: I am extremely biased to the type of system I played in New England, a defense that is multiple and that will adjust to the team they’re playing against. When you play defense, to me, it’s about the opponent. Who are you playing? Like I don’t want to come in and say, ‘Man, we’re the best team against the run and we’re playing the [worst running team] and we’re going to stop the run.’ … If we’re the best team against the run, we should stop the run; let’s stop what they do well. And in the football world, we know Tampa Bay and Todd Bowles and his defense, we used to call it, ‘They’re a do-what-they-do team.’ Like what they do week in and week out, they’re going to match up a little bit to what you do. But for the most part, ‘Our defense is good. We have the players that fit it. We’re going to do what we do.’ McCourty went on to lecture about how Bucs cornerback Zyon McCollum is not as good as departed Carlton Davis and Bowles hasn’t adjusted accordingly. He said it’s clear teams target McCollum significantly more than Jamel Dean. “To me they haven’t really adjusted to, ‘Hey, we have a pretty good front-7. We gotta make these guys do some hard stuff. Play with a light box,” McCourty ranted. In short, McCourty thinks Bowles puts his secondary “in too many vulnerable positions.” Simms seemed in disbelief how Bowles asks edge rusher YaYa Diaby to cover slants and drop out of a five-man rush. Simms also dropped another F-bomb about how Bowles loads up a run-defense box to much when he doesn’t need to. “You don’t need to go all-in on the run [defense,]” Simms said. “I don’t know if I’ve ever seen Todd Bowles adjust other than the damn Super Bowl against Mahomes.” Now Joe could poke a couple of holes in what Simms and McCourty are saying, but the broader point is the growing lack of respect for the Bucs defense and how that message is being trumpeted to the masses.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/todd-bowles-addresses-poor-fundamentals/|Todd Bowles Addresses Poor Fundamentals|Not quite 24 hours after the Bucs lost an embarrassing, sloppier-than-sloppy game to the sorry Cowboys and Troy Aikman Cooper Rush, it isn’t the loss that has Joe triggered so much today. It’s that Bucs coach Todd Bowles correctly fingers his defensive players for poor fundamentals and really bad tackling. In late December? How can that be happening? How can that be allowed to happen with playoff hopes on the line? That is just astonishing to Joe and Bowles discussed this in his day-after presser. “It is concerning,” Bowles said. “I mean we have a lot of different people playing so it’s always concerning. You always have to coach them. “We had a few of those – we had less of them when we had the winning streak and then a couple of them creeped up [Sunday night] that we have to put out. “[It’s just] discipline and practicing every day and everybody has to do their part, coaches and players.” Well, if it takes no more “Victory Mondays” and forcing players, win or lose, to hit the practice fields on Mondays, so be it. But dang, this team has been practicing since July. No, Joe doesn’t count underwear football. That’s basically playing grab-ass. How in the world can a team be playing with poor fundamentals in late December? Joe can’t wrap his head around that. Players don’t forget fundamentals like they left their credit card at an adult clothing-optional establishment on Dale Mabry Highway. Fundamentals are habitual. They are ingrained. You work on them until you don’t even think about it. They come naturally. Talk about not having your head in the game, a critical, perhaps playoffs-killing game.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/not-doing-what-they-were-supposed-to-be-doing/|“Not Doing What They Were Supposed To Be Doing”|Joe might have heard the most depressed tone Joe can remember in Todd Bowles’ voice this morning, and it wasn’t during the head coach’s official team news conference.  Bowles sounded like a guy who was just asked why he missed three free throws when he needed one to tie a basketball game. Or Bowles sounded like a baseball player who forgot to touch third base on his way home. Or Bowles spoke as if someone hacked his phone and deleted his prized Stevie Wonder tracks. In reality, SiriusXM NFL Radio co-host and former Bucs/Bowles defensive back Logan Ryan asked Bowles why stud Cowboys receiver went off on the Bucs last night. Bowles didn’t sugarcoat anything to his former player. He pointed at Jamel Dean and Zyon McCollum. “That was just fundamentals and technique out on the corner, looking in the backfield and not doing what they were supposed to be doing. That’s really all it was, Ryan,” Bowles said. What a kick in the gut that has to be for Bowles. He waited weeks to get McCollum and Dean back on the field together healthy, and they let him down on a big stage against an elite receiver. Dean is super close to Bowles personally and McCollum is one of Bowles’ prized development success as a third-year player drafted in Round 5. Joe sure hopes those guys feel badly about their mistakes and tighten up Sunday for their head coach/defensive coordinator.|2024-12-23 14:46:00|241|43|2|Todd Bowles|Bowles disappointed in players not meeting expectations.|2|Fans express deep frustration and disappointment with the team's inconsistencies and coaching failures.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""SB~LV"", ""post"": ""and the finger pointing begins\u2026"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""23rd,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""2:51"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""KABucs"", ""post"": ""My take on the Bucs is that they\u2019re just a very inconsistent team,  we can\u2019t count on anything from them game to game.

Now Bowles could go to the injury card too.  Simply put, it is up to the brains at OBP to make the call if Bowles goes 10-8 or so.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/tony-dungy-todd-bowles-screwed-up-on-timeout-call/|Tony Dungy: Todd Bowles Screwed Up On Timeout Call|You know it’s bad when Father Dungy, one of the holy figures in #NFLMedia, calls you out on national television.  So the Bucs got a first down with 54 seconds remaining in the second quarter at the Cowboys’ 10 yard line last night. Great play! Then Todd Bowles hurried to call his final timeout of the half. What was the hurry? Dallas had three remaining timeouts and a hot kicker, and their offense had been moving the ball on the Bucs all game to that point. Bowles said today that the offense needed a timeout. Great. That was a fine answer. But what was the hurry to call it so quickly? The Bucs could have let the clock run down to, say, 34 seconds. And in reality, Dallas surely would have called a timeout if it saw the Bucs wasting a lot of time. So Bowles loses the argument in two directions. Dungy threw his dagger on a Football Night In America postgame show. “I thought this was not the right thing to do,” Dungy said of the Bucs calling timeout with 54 seconds remaining. “… Go up there. Run your next play. You want to score. You’re going to have plenty of time, but they scored with 48 seconds left. [Then] Dallas moves it down; they’ve got a great long-range kicker. He makes it — three points that comes back to haunt you at the end of the game. … The thing to do is line up, run your next play and if you need a timeout, then take it when it’s in the 30s (seconds left) in the 20s. Don’t take it with [54 seconds left].” Well said by a Hall of Fame head coach and Buccaneers Ring of Honor member.|2024-12-23 11:12:00|293|55|4|Todd Bowles|Timeout call criticism by Tony Dungy and analysis.|1|Overall sentiments are highly critical and pessimistic about Coach Bowles' coaching abilities.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""ocala"", ""post"": ""Coach Bowels is not a good head coach.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/we-gotta-fight-for-it/|“We Gotta Fight For It”|So Baker Mayfield fumbled with two hands on the ball last night, which led to a 3rd-and-40 play. Rachaad White also fumbled with two hands on the ball with the game on the line. Rookie receiver Jalen McMillan (photo above) got out-battled for a gorgeous, 55-yard touchdown throw within his grasp. Tight end Payne Durham also had the ball ripped from of his hands by the Cowboys. Todd Bowles was still disgusted by the events this morning. “We gotta fight for it,” Bowles said of last night’s fumbling. “We knew they were going to rake at the ball going into the ballgame. We gotta take better care of the football. That’s priority No. 1.” Toughness and playing smart football. Those are tied to fumbling, and the Bucs are one of the highest-fumbling teams in the league, which was not the case last season. So many crushing fumbles. Rachaad White had a back-breaker in Week 9. Bucky Irving’s lost the Bucs a game in Atlanta. In many seasons, it’s hard to remember very costly fumbles.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/we-needed-the-timeout/|“We Needed The Timeout”|Bucs coach Todd Bowles addressed the Bucs’ ill-timed timeout late in the first half that allowed the Cowboys enough time to get in position to kick a 58-yard field goal last night. The Bucs lost by two. Bowles — while he did not get into any specifics — was asked about the timeout this morning in his day-after presser. He said, “We needed it. Offensively, we needed it.” Bowles did not elaborate on the follow-up question. He only responded, “We needed it.” Why? Was his offense out of gas? If so, that’s on conditioning. Was it the Bucs had too many players on the field? Was it the Bucs didn’t have enough players on the field? Were the wrong players on the field for what Liam Coen wanted to do? No matter how you slice it, that timeout is on the coaching staff. If the players screwed up, then they weren’t prepared (they sure didn’t look or play like they were prepared in the first half). Strange.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/bucs-playoff-chances-fall-to-58-or-51-percent/|Bucs Playoff Chances Fall To 58 (Or 51) Percent|Chin up. Put the pitchfork back in the garage. The Bucs can still finish the season 10-7 and host a playoff game.  The data nerds at the New York Times/TheAthletic.com say their software gives the Bucs a 58 percent chance of making the playoffs and a 52 percent shot of qualifying as a Wild Card in the NFC. In fact, despite being tied with the Bucs and holding a head-to-head tiebreaker edge, the Falcons (8-7) have less of a chance of reaching the postseason. The Times/Athletic crew give them a 48 percent shot at the playoffs overall. That’s because the Falcons face the hot Commanders (10-5) on the road on Sunday night. Atlanta closes with a home date against the Panthers. The Bucs have remaining games against the Panthers and slimy Saints in Tampa. However, the NFL super computers say the Bucs only have a 51 percent shot at the postseason while Atlanta holds a 55 percent chance. Joe can’t say whose computer models are more accurate, though Joe might believe anything NFL data queen Cynthia Frelund has to say.|2024-12-23 09:05:00|180|48|7|Bucs Playoff Chances|Buccaneers have modest chance of reaching playoffs despite competition.|2|Comments are critical of Todd Bowles and the team's performance, with some optimism expressed.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""AUSTIN"", ""post"": ""I don\u2019t want to make the playoffs, that will help keep Todd around next year. lose both games by 30 please, fire Bowles, hire Liam, and lets move on"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""23rd,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""9:06"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""LVMYBUCS"", ""post"": ""Really and then what lose in the first round because Todd Bowles defense sucks"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""23rd,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""9:07"", ""am""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""Henry"", ""post"": ""What \ud83d\udc4d they said!"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""23rd,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""9:07"", ""am""]}, ""commenter3"": {""username"": ""Les"", ""post"": ""Enough of Todd bowles .

Not so much on long balls. In fact, Mayfield struggled with the long ball. And that’s a reason Mike Evans had but five catches for 69 yards. Joe speculated it was because Dallas took away the long ball. Speaking after the game, Mayfield told the Fourth Estate that’s exactly what happened. “On some of the shots, they were covering him up – some of the down-the-field explosive plays that we tried to dial up for him, they were covering up pretty well,” Mayfield said of Evans. “Obviously, he made a great catch on the one-on-one go ball earlier in the game. “But yeah, they were typical [with] what teams do, roll a safety over the top trying to press him up a little bit and take two guys to take him away. But that’s why other guys had good opportunities.” And that’s why Mayfield was doing well with short passes. On passes where Mayfield got rid of the ball oin less than 2.5 seconds, Mayfield connected on 16 for 144 yards and a touchdown.|2024-12-23 09:00:00|187|28|5|Baker Mayfield|Mayfield struggled with long balls against Dallas|2|Pessimistic sentiment dominated by frustration, criticism, and disappointment towards team performance and coaching.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""AUSTIN"", ""post"": ""when you have 5 people in your face right after you snap it, its hard to throw the ball.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/a-quick-thank-you-on-a-tough-morning/|A Quick Thank You On A Tough Morning|Sleepless night for Joe and so many other Bucs fans. Man, just when you think the Bucs have turned a corner, they drive off the Courtney Campbell Causeway and into the mangroves. (Not underwater, just in need of a tow truck.) It’s got Joe grateful for playing on a championship team at JoeBucsFan.com world headquarters. Today, Joe cruised to 7.8 million actual visits to the website in 2024. That represents about 20 million pages viewed. It’s been stunning consistency around here for a long time, for which Joe is very grateful to the many, many thousands who burn priceless minutes of their day here religiously. (Joe likes the newcomers and irregulars, too). Aside from paying the bills, the mere presence here of so many fans soothes Joe through the challenging times. Thank you.|2024-12-23 08:45:00|133|0|6.5|Joe|Grateful thanks to loyal fans despite tough times.||No comments available.|{}
https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/the-blame-game-2/|The Blame Game|Joe loves how some fans have firm rules for the blame game as it relates to a Buccaneers loss. There are no rules! It’s football, the ultimate team sport. And with so many contributors and moments and approaches, Joe recommends not telling fans how to feel about their team. To be cliché, the Bucs are what their record says they are: 8 wins and 7 losses. Only 13 NFL teams have a better record. Today, Joe can’t think of a moment in history in which the Bucs’ record fit the team more snuggly. The Bucs look like an 8-7 team. It’s been a true roller coaster ride. Thankfully, the seat belts still work. Tampa Bay has had far too many subpar quarterbacks have extra special days against their defense. They’ve also been sloppy with the football. The Bucs rightly have been described as dominant and punishing at times, too. Of those 13 teams with better records, the Bucs have beaten four of them. Tampa Bay also has six wins by two scores of more. And they’ve got rookies in key roles playing well late in the season (again). Consistency has eluded the Bucs throughout the Todd Bowles regime, though they played strong ball through the playoffs last season. So Bowles looks like an 8-7 head coach. Joe wouldn’t throw a verbal dart at any fan who concludes that Bowles is not a Super Bowl-caliber leader. There’s a stack of evidence on the table. But Joe also would tell that same fan to take a deep breath and assess after 17 games, and hopefully more in the postseason. Not every head coach deserves a full-season evaluation (positive or negative), but Joe believes Bowles certainly does, as do nearly all the Bucs, though Joe has seen more than enough of Joe Tryon-Shoyinka and a few others. Joe’s frustrated because there’s enough talent on this roster to be better than 8-7. And Joe doesn’t think that’s an emotional evaluation after a tough loss. One thing the agitated interns and fans at JoeBucsFan.com world headquarters can agree on this morning is that the Bucs should win their final two games at home against weaker opponents (Carolina and New Orleans). Given how the Bucs have played this season, that would be a huge step forward for the franchise.|2024-12-23 08:24:00|383|71|6|The Blame Game|Fans assess Buccaneers' 8-7 season performance realistically.|2|Pessimistic sentiment dominates with criticism towards Todd Bowles, team's performance, and coaching decisions.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""StormyInFL"", ""post"": ""I dont think a win is a given in either case."", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""23rd,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""8:28"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""AUSTIN"", ""post"": ""Whole game would have been way different if sterling caught that 4th down dart\u2026 I\u2019m just ready for a change\u2026 Todd is too calm, too laid back, no energy or drive\u2026 I was rooting for him to come in and make Tampa a defensive juggernaut when he took over, but we all know that is far from the case\u2026 so there is no point to keep him"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""23rd,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""8:29"", ""am""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""HC Grover"", ""post"": ""8-7 or 7-8 that is because the sum of both is 15.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/baker-mayfield-struggled-with-the-long-ball/|Baker Mayfield Struggled With The Long Ball|Well here is very interesting information by way of NextGen Stats on Baker Mayfield last night: The Bucs quarterback struggled when he had to hang onto the ball in the two-point loss to the Cowboys. But when Mayfield unloaded the ball quickly, he was sharp, notes Grant Gordon of NFL.com. … Mayfield was efficient in the quick passing game against the Cowboys (16 for 18, 144 yards, touchdown) but struggled when holding the ball for more than 2.5 seconds (15 of 25, 159 yards, TD, interception, sacked four times). Now Joe knows exactly what the vast majority of Joe’s readers will holler. “The offensive line!” Joe is confident the reason is more nuanced than that. Joe will take a stab and suggest the Cowboys, having studied film, saw how the Bucs burned the Chargers on long balls last week (they only threw four but three went for touchdowns) and decided the following: We’ll let the Bucs dink and dunk all night if that’s what they want to do, but we will play aggressively to take away the long ball.|2024-12-23 02:43:00|179|57|5|Baker Mayfield|Baker Mayfield struggled with deep passes against Cowboys.|3|Mixed opinions on various aspects of the team's performance, with criticism of coaching and players.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Bucfan1988"", ""post"": ""These next-gen stats are wrong\u2026."", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""23rd,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""2:51"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""George Nostej"", ""post"": ""It\u2019s pretty simple.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/five-things-83/|Five Things|Joe hates to be the Grinch with Christmas in two days, but lumps of coal are in your stockings, Bucs! With the playoffs on the line you played like you did nothing but listen to the hype and pretended the Cowboys were the Titans (emphasis on the first syllable).  So let’s get this going so you can finish holiday shopping and make sure you get a good bottle of Christmas cheer to help you forget last night. The Grinch Stole Bucs’ Christmas — And Maybe The Season As soon as Rachaad White fumbled on the final Bucs offensive play sealing one of the most depressing losses since the 1999 NFC Championship game, the lyrics to “The Grinch Song” spun through Joe’s head. You’re a mean one You really are a heel You’re as cuddly as a cactus You’re as charming as an eel Mr. Grinch  Yeah, it seems the Grinch stole Christmas for Bucs fans. (Doesn’t the Grinch sort of look like ol’ shriveled-up Jerry Jones?) Here the Bucs were flying high just after curb-stomping the Chargers, and the Cowboys had nothing to play for as they were eliminated from postseason play early Sunday. So exactly who looked like they were playing for the playoffs and who looked like they were playing for the draft? Yup, the Bucs looked like they were playing for the draft. Really, really, really sloppy football. Missed tackles all over the place in the first half. Dropped balls. Dropped touchdowns. Not hanging onto the ball. Awful fumbles. Sacks. It looked like one of those worthless preseason games. And now the Bucs may be screwed out of the playoffs. Screwed by themselves. Screwed by playing undisciplined ball. Screwed. Joe will have a tough time enjoying Christmas. That game last night may have ruined all for which the Bucs have worked. And it may have ruined the lone season with perhaps the best Bucs offensive coordinator not named “Bucco Bruce Arians.” Ruined maybe Lavonte David’s final season. Ruined perhaps Mike Evans’ chase for 1,000 yards receiving. Ruined. Maybe. The Bucs Are Not Clutch The Bucs simply melted down trying to come back from the hole the defense dug in the first half. Was that really surprising? How many clutch games did the Bucs p!ss away this year? In seven one-score games, the Bucs are 2-5. The Bucs beat the Lions 20-16 in Week 2. Since, the Bucs have been in six one-score games. The Bucs lost five, only beating Carolina in overtime. The Bucs are simply not a clutch team. So Joe, unfortunately, was not shocked when the Bucs fully melted down on the final drive. The Bucs don’t win close games. The Bucs can’t handle close games. The Bucs are not clutch. And that is why, now, the Bucs are wearing out rosaries hoping the Dixie Chicks lose a game and the Bucs can win their final two, both division games at home. When you cannot play clutch football in close games, mistakes magnify. A penalty here, a dropped pass there, a fumble over here, a missed tackle there, are 20 times more important in a close game. In a one-score game, one mistake can cost you. And the Bucs made plenty last night. Time Management Fails Again Ever since Bucs coach Todd Bowles has been with the Jets, the clock has been his enemy. That has carried over to his Bucs tenure. For Joe, other than the Rachaad White fumble and the Jalen McMillan touchdown that was ripped out of his hands (It sure looked to Joe that McMillan hit the turf with possession), the game was lost on a timeout. Late in the first half, the Bucs had the ball on the Cowboys-10 with 54 seconds left. The Bucs called timeout. Joe doesn’t know if it was ordered by numbers analyst Jackie Davidson on the headset with Bowles, or it came from Bowles himself, but that timeout couldn’t have been stupider. As soon as the Bucs called timeout (it was their final timeout of the half), Joe thought, with the Bucs defense impersonating Mike Smith’s defense and with Dallas kicker Brandon Aubrey only needing the Cowboys to get across midfield for a field goal, the Bucs should have run the clock down and not given Dallas a chance to score. Or at the very least make Dallas call its first timeout of the half to stop the clock. But nope, the Bucs called timeout and handed Mike McCarthy time (48 seconds and 3 timeouts) to get 30 yards so Aubrey could boot a 58-yard field goal, which is exactly what happened. What was the final score? Oh, 26-24. You mean the Bucs lost by two? You mean the Bucs might have won if Bowles had elected to chew up clock? What a country! Joe wants to know how Bowles could not realize this. Or, if Davidson is such a numbers person, how could she not know this? How many millions a year, collectively, do Bowles and Davidson earn? Yet an unemployed shoe repairman sitting in a bar three beers in could see a timeout with 54 seconds left in the half was setting up the Cowboys to score there. Again, when teams are in close games, bad decicions are magnified. And calling timeout with 54 seconds left may have cost the Bucs the playoffs. Easily Influenced By “Rat Poison” Last week, Todd Bowles confidently said the white noise of talking heads and hollering shows does not affect the Bucs. He said it didn’t when they were losing and it won’t while they are winning. Last night, did it appear the Bucs’ heads were somewhere else in the first half? Even though Bowles confidently proclaimed the Bucs are not influenced by the outside world, the very next day outside linebacker YaYa Diaby told Joe the team very much believed its press clippings early in the season and that’s exactly why the Bucs had their arses handed to them by the Broncos. We live in a different world than when Bowles played in the 1980s and 1990s. Back then, you almost had to try to find sports chatter. Sure, there was BSPN but rarely did the four-letter have talk shows. It was mostly games and news. There was no internet, no blogs, no podcasts and limited sports radio. Now? It’s everywhere and players can’t escape it unless they are single, don’t have phones or internet, or are social loners and do nothing else but go home after a day at One Buc Palace and stare at the four walls of their apartments. So while Bowles may think (or portray the image) that his players are not prone to talking heads and podcast chatter about the team, that’s simply unrealistic. And it’s sad that several on this team are so gullible to the “rat poison” and let it take over their heads. That sure seemed to be the case in Dallas. When The Bucs Don’t Score First…  This is a sad stat and makes Joe wonder if, as Lavonte David would say, it’s all about mentality. When the Bucs score first, the Bucs are 8-1. When the Bucs don’t score first they are 0-6. Joe has no idea why this is. Are the Bucs so weak mentally that they panic or collapse even when the opponent kicks a field goal to go up 3-0? Are the Bucs mentally not capable of playing catch-up? That’s impossible to believe with their offense. Something is not wired right if a team cannot win a game without scoring first. Hell, the Bucs damn near got to the NFC title game last year and then-offensive coordinator Dave Canales’ offense never scored a touchdown on an opening drive. Now the Bucs have the second-best offensive coordinator they’ve ever had and they often score on their first drive. But if they can’t score first they can’t rally? That’s just really weird.|2024-12-23 02:39:00|1317|47|2|Bucs|Disappointing loss and pessimism about playoff chances.|2|Responses are overwhelmingly critical of Todd Bowles and express disappointment and frustration.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Mr_Barf"", ""post"": ""This team is an psychological nightmare of flippant two faced mendacious leadership"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""23rd,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""2:55"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Saskbucs"", ""post"": ""It\u2019s a play not to lose mindset Joe.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/todd-bowles-loss-can-be-summed-up-in-one-word/|Todd Bowles: Loss Can Be Summed Up In One Word|Todd Bowles, now head coach of a team outside looking in for a shot at the playoffs after losing with terribly sloppy play on national television Sunday night, used one word to describe the loss. “Fundamentals.” The Bucs had lousy fundamentals in the first half. It sort of improved in the second half but when the Bucs needed points, sloppy play and not taking care of the ball crept back to the surface. “Fundamentals,” Bowles said. “Fundamentals and technique.” Well, technique is fundamentals. So is ball security. Jalen McMillan had what would have been a game-winning touchdown late in the fourth quarter but he allowed the ball to be ripped out of his arms at the goal line for a pick by Jourdan Lewis. And when the Bucs were on a do-or-die drive, Rachaad White had the ball stripped fighting for an extra yard. Fundamentals. Now Joe has zero idea how fundamentals — technique, ball security, whatever you want to call it — are still an issue in late December. The Bucs have been practicing since friggin’ July for crying out loud. Is Bowles not teaching fundamentals? Are his players too dense to learn? Joe is sort of going to give White a pass. He doesn’t often fumble. But he did have a crushing lost fumble on the second play from scrimmage against the Falcons in Week 8. Last night, to hold the ball on the fatal play like the proverbial loaf of bread, man, only Billy Sims could get away with holding the ball like that. White ain’t no Billy Sims. When Bowles was asked about the poor tackling, he again went back to his one-word answer for the ills of the game. “It’s fundamentals, it’s fundamental,” Bowles said. “Tackling in the first half was not very good. It was better in the second half.” There again, this team has been practicing since July. They still don’t know how to tackle? What is Joe missing? Or to the point, what are Bowles’ players missing?|2024-12-23 02:20:00|335|57|4|Todd Bowles|Loss due to poor fundamentals and sloppy play.|3|Pessimistic comments dominated by criticism towards Todd Bowles and the team's performance.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""MadMax"", ""post"": ""Bye\u2026.thats the word"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""23rd,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""2:25"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Drunkinybor"", ""post"": ""I\u2019m sure Emo-Bowles mumbled quietly every word"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""23rd,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""2:30"", ""am""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""MadMax"", ""post"": ""Players f\u2019d up, we all know\u2026.but it comes down to how we\u2019ve lost these close games this season and last\u2026.poor management, and who manages things?

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/ira-kaufmans-10-takeaways-from-bucs-cowboys-4/|Ira Kaufman’s 10 Takeaways From Bucs-Cowboys|BY IRA KAUFMAN In the end, the Cowboys wanted it a little more. How else do you explain Dallas coming up with two fourth-quarter takeaways by wrestling the ball away from Jalen McMillan and Rachaad White en route to a 26-24 victory? In what was surely one of the more physical games of the 2024 season, the Cowboys played forcefully with nothing to lose, sending a message of support for Coach Mike McCarthy to Jerry Jones. The Bucs had everything to play for and now need help in their quest for a fourth consecutive NFC South title. Tampa Bay’s defense was ravaged by Cooper Rush in the opening half as he threw for 220 of his 292 yards. Dallas never trailed but the Bucs made things interesting in the final minutes before White’s fumble snapped a 4-game winning streak and left the Falcons jubilant. Atlanta and Tampa Bay are both 8-7, but the Falcons hold the tie-breaker due to a season sweep that remains mystifying to ownership and everyone who works at One Buc Place. Atlanta faces 10-5 Washington on the road Sunday evening, hours after the Bucs play Carolina at home. The Commanders are 6-2 at home behind stellar rookie quarterback Jayden Daniels, so there’s a decent chance the Bucs will be back atop the division heading into the final week of the regular season. Sunday’s game was marked by hard hitting on both sides. Rush played poised with no turnovers and the Buc defense was guilty of passive play and poor tackling as Dallas took a 23-14 halftime lead. The Cowboys were limited to three first downs and 74 total yards in the final two quarters, but any hopes of a dynamic comeback were thwarted when Baker Mayfield was picked off in the end zone and White was stripped after grabbing a desperation pass while Mayfield was falling down. Tampa Bay’s run defense was sensational, but Rush had way too much time to scan the field in the opening half and CeeDee Lamb burned the secondary — despite missing much of the game with an injured shoulder. Brandon Aubrey converted field goals from 58, 49, 58 and 53 yards when drives stalled, reinforcing his reputation as one of the league’s premier kickers. The Cowboys had been eliminated from the postseason before the game began, yet they gave their fans 60 minutes of passion and effort. Here’s how the Cowboys improved to 2-6 at home and held on to inflict a potentially crushing setback to the favored visitors: * Todd Bowles didn’t have to look at the film before he told Melissa Stark at halftime that Tampa Bay’s tackling was subpar. He won’t feel any differently after he watches the tape. Too many yards after the catch for Rush’s targets. Way too many. * Mayfield threw for 303 yards and a pair of scores, despite being battered and bruised from start to finish. The Cowboys sacked him four times and Mayfield played through pain all evening. When protection broke down, as it did quite a few times, Mayfield hurt the Cowboys with three scambles for 42 yards. The interception wasn’t Mayfield’s fault as McMillan was outmuscled by defensive back Jourdan Lewis as both players toppled to the ground. * Rico Dowdle, who was coming off three consecutive 100-yard games, found no running room as Tampa Bay held him to 23 yards in 13 carries. That’s what made Rush’s first-half performance even more impressive. * Although Micah Parsons posted a sack and five tackles, the Bucs didn’t allow him to wreck the game. Parsons and Luke Goedeke engaged in fierce trench battles and Goedeke more than held his own. * The final four possessions for the Cowboys resulted in two first downs and four punts. By the time Bowles figured out how to rattle Rush, the Bucs were too far behind. * Mike Evans, relatively quiet with five receptions for 69 yards, needs 182 yards in the final two games to keep his 1,000-yard streak alive. Mayfield is very aware of the numbers and my guess is Evans gets it. * Before Sterling Shepard left with a hamstring injury, he had dropped one pass … maybe two. LB J.J. Russell failed to haul in an errant Rush throw that hit him square in the numbers. Too many mistakes. * Christian Izien was a dynamo with a game-high 13 tackles, including nine solo stops. * With only seven interceptions in 15 games, the Bucs fell to minus-6 in turnover differential. A year ago, they finished plus-8. * The Bucs played hard, but they didn’t play smart and it cost them a chance to control their own destiny heading into Week 17. If they want to apply pressure to the Falcons, the Bucs have to take care of business against a Carolina team that has been quite competitive in the past seven weeks, including an OT loss to Tampa Bay. Atlanta is a road underdog, so there’s no reason for Buc fans to lose faith. |2024-12-23 02:12:00|833|23|4|Ira Kaufman|Cowboys outplayed Bucs in physical game; Bucs seek division help.|2|Mixed reactions with skepticism towards team leadership, officiating, and playoff prospects.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""ModHairKen"", ""post"": ""Spot on.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/commanders-win-muddies-bucs-postseason-waters/|Commanders Win Muddied Bucs’ Postseason Waters|After today’s games, the Bucs would need a mountain of help to qualify for the playoffs as a Wild Card team. Washington and Green Bay, the current No. 6 and No. 7 seeds if the NFC playoffs began today, each have 10 wins while the Bucs have an 8-7 record with two games remaining on every team’s schedule. Washington (10-5) hosts the Falcons on Sunday night and closes at Dallas. The Packers (10-4) host the sadsack Saints tonight and then close with the Vikings and Bears. The Bucs’ only real prayer of a Wild Card entry would be Washington losing its final two games and the Bucs winning theirs. The Bucs own the key head-to-head tiebreaker on Washington. So after the Bucs’ groin-stomp loss to the Cowboys last night, Tampa Bay’s best hope of the postseason is to win the NFC South. That means praying the Commanders beat the Falcons on Sunday night and the Bucs beating the Panthers and Saints to close the season, which would give the Bucs the division title.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/sloppy-bucs/|Sloppy Bucs|Is there a reason why the Bucs fumble the ball more than any team in the NFC? Joe doesn’t get it. There were three more fumbles tonight and one became a Rachaad White turnover to the Cowboys that ended the Bucs’ potential game-winning drive at the Bucs’ 31 yard line. Another was a Baker Mayfield cough-up that ended with the Bucs having a 3rd-and-40 play. (Yes, 40). The Bucs fumble nearly twice per game. Recovering a fumble is nice, which the Bucs are pretty good at doing, but protecting the football is far better. It was a Bucky Irving fumble late against Atlanta that surely cost the Bucs a win. Tonight it was White with a fumble that maybe cost the Bucs a win. Todd Bowles overly obsesses about turnovers. Joe’s almost starting to move toward Bowles’ corner. Protect the damn ball.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/sack-eating-baker-mayfield-2/|Sack-Eating Baker Mayfield|Joe counts on Baker Mayfield to make smart decisions. It doesn’t always happen. One bad one tonight proved crushing in a two-point loss.  The Bucs had the ball with a 3rd-and-5 late in the second quarter at the Dallas 40 yard line. Mayfield had one major priority on that play in which Mayfield dropped back to pass. Don’t get sacked and protect the football. He failed. Mayfield ate a five-yard sack for no good reason and that knocked the Bucs out of Chase McLaughlin’s field goal range. The Bucs’ subsequent punt on fourth down was a touchback. The great QBs don’t take that sack. Mayfield did. Joe’s pointed a lot of fingers at a lot of plays that probably cost the Bucs dearly tonight.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/backups-doing-backup-things/|Backups Doing Backup Things|With about 6:25 remaining in the game tonight and the Bucs trailing 26-17, backup linebacker J.J. Russell dropped what looked like a sure interception deep in Dallas territory. That came after Sterling Shepard dropped two would be first downs in the first quarter. Joe can throw shade at Todd Bowles for these happenings, but that’s hard to do. There’s a reason those guys aren’t front line starters. Joe already wrote about rookie Jalen McMillan showing his lack of seasoning and toughness on two key occasions. But this is where the Bucs season is, and it’s a predicament most of the NFL is in because of injuries. It’s no excuse. However, the Bucs started the season slightly shy of depth because of lingering salary cap issues from the Tom Brady years. That’s nobody’s fault. So perhaps with more money to spend the Bucs would have had a better third-string inside linebacker making a key pick, or a more seasoned and sound receiver behind injured Chris Godwin making a play where Shepard and McMillan faltered. Lots of what-ifs on Tampa Bay’s side of the ball, including “what if the Bucs had an edge rush?” Joe’s not crying tonight, however, a 10-6 record is well within reach and Washington (8-7) looks like they’ll need a miracle to beat Washington on the road next Sunday.|2024-12-23 00:03:00|221|29|3|Backups|Challenges faced by Bucs backups due to injuries and depth.|3|Mixed sentiments from fans, critical of performance and coaching, some optimism for the future.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""BucfaninMi"", ""post"": ""Detroit has 15 players on IR they\u2019re 13-2"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""23rd,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""12:05"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Rod Munch"", ""post"": ""You know how makes that play?"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""23rd,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""12:07"", ""am""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""RagingBrisket"", ""post"": ""Puhlease\u2026starters are backups.
