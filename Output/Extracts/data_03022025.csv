https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/potential-khalil-mack-sniffing/|“Potential” Khalil Mack Sniffing|So the guy who broke the story last March claiming the Bucs were shopping Carlton Davis and Jamel Dean is now claiming, after a week at the NFL Scouting Combine, the Bucs are potentially in the sweepstakes for beastly edge rusher Khalil Mack. That’s what Jeremy Fowler of ESPN is hearing. Mack, the nine-time Pro Bowler, just turned 34 and is a pending free agent. And there’s a great chance the Chargers aren’t interested in re-signing him. Per Fowler, the consensus among teams is that Mack played well last season and the only concern surrounding him is age. Fowler said the Bucs and Bears are names he’s hearing connected to Mack. Joe knows with great certainty that the Bucs had interest in Mack back in 2018. The Raiders traded him to Chicago late that summer for a flurry of draft picks. Joe’s glad the Bucs are likely sniffing Mack. Yeah, he only had six sacks last season, but he represents a massive upgrade and he started 16 games after not missing a game in 2022 and 2023. If Mack wants a shot to win a Super Bowl and add to his borderline Hall of Fame résumé (107.5 sacks), then he should want to play alongside Vita Vea and Calijah Kancey in Tampa.|2025-03-02 16:15:00|212|58|8|Khalil Mack|Bucs potentially interested in signing Khalil Mack for pass rush.|6|Mixed opinions on signing Mack due to age and recent performance, with some optimism.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""SteveK"", ""post"": ""Yes, please!"", ""post_time"": [""March"", ""2nd,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""4:24"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Aqualung"", ""post"": ""My dog sniffs a lot of other dogs.

Heck, one day he’s hammering skinny margaritas and the next day it’s old school American beer. Mayfield is diverse as a leader, too, as head coach Todd Bowles explained during his 1-on-1 chat with Josina Anderson at the NFL Scouting Combine last week. “I think he handles them all differently depending on what they need and what they do, which is very bright on his part,” Bowles said of his franchise quarterback. Obviously, he’s been through some things in this league; he’s got some experience now. He can lead by putting his arm around you. He can lead by yelling at you. He can lead by example. He can lead by just sitting down at the cafeteria talking to you, so he has a lot of ways to lead and understands the guys very well. And he makes sure everybody’s ingratiated on the team and comes together the right way.” Mayfield, his bargain salary and the Bucs’ high-octane offense are huge reasons Joe thinks the Bucs should be in win-now mode.|2025-03-02 14:52:00|180|20|6|Baker Mayfield|Diverse and adaptable leader with experience|6|Mixed sentiments on Baker's future, financial concerns, leadership qualities, and performance in playoffs.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""catcard202"", ""post"": ""Bucs have a 1-2 year window for \u201cWin-Now\u201d moves.

Gholston first mentioned the five-year, $27.5 million deal Licht signed him to before the 2017 season. Joe told Gholston that can’t count. So after a good amount of thought (which Joe greatly appreciated), Gholston pointed to former Bucs defensive tackle Rakeem Nuñez-Roches. Nacho, as he was known, was signed off the street by Licht early in the 2018 season. In 2020, he replaced Vita Vea in the starting lineup and was fantastic in his 15 starts, including the postseason. The Bucs’ incredibly suffocating run defense did not miss a beat. “I gotta go with Nacho,” Gholston told Joe last year. “That guy was tough, productive, great teammate, just a really good player and what did [Licht] pay for him? I mean the Bucs just signed him as a real young player with experience and he was great in the locker room, too. If you can add guys like that every offseason, you’re going to have a special team.” Fun and unique pick by Gholston. Joe was told by a Bucs official that the team didn’t want to lose Nacho in free agency following the 2022 season, but Nacho’s value was slightly miscalculated and he was signed quickly by the Giants on a three-year, $12 million deal. If Nuñez-Roches, 31, is a Giants salary cap casualty soon, don’t be surprised if he’s back again in Tampa.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/todd-bowles-explained-what-he-learned-about-the-2024-bucs/|Todd Bowles Explained What He Learned About The 2024 Bucs|Well, we certainly know one takeaway Todd Bowles had about his Bucs last year: They needed a lot more takeaways. Bowles, in his various combine media availabilities last week at the Indiana Convention Center in downtown Indianapolis, said several times the Bucs need “ballhawks.” But there was something else Bowles learned about last season: He found unexpected depth. “I thought [Kaevon] Merriweather came back and did a heck of a job,” Bowles began. “I thought [Christian] Izien carried us probably halfway through the season when he was healthy. I thought ‘J-Mac’ (Jalen McMillan) came on late in the season from a rookie standpoint. “We had a lot of young guys stand up, so that was encouraging. … Overall, I thought the competition part of it was great.” Bowles also found out he had a solid backup tackle in Justin Skule, who is a pending free agent. No, Skule did not have a good game starting at Detroit after Luke Goedeke went down with a concussion and missed five games. He got worked by Aidan Hutchinson. Badly. There was no sugarcoating it. However, Skule got better and was a key cog in the offense for nearly a quarter of the season. “The big thing, when Luke [Goedeke] went down and ‘Skuley’ (Justin Skule) had to step in, that was huge,” Bowles said. “Nobody really talked about Luke being down for a few weeks.” Along with the play of defensive backs Kaevon Merriweather and Christian Izien, Bowles liked how backups exceled when the Bucs needed them last season. “I thought those guys got some experience and really helped us in the end and developed some depth,” Bowles said. “Going into this year, that’s something we can hopefully build on.” If Bucs AC/DC-loving general manager Jason Licht has another draft like he’s had the past two years, the Bucs ought to have loads of depth. But definitely get starters. For example, an edge rusher, an inside linebacker and maybe a corner, too.

You know the ones, they’re personal but tied to their team. For example, early in the 2022 season Todd Bowles was asked which of players would could be quality NFL coaches: Bowles named his four, which included only one guy on the current roster. That was Lavonte David. Will Gholston and Mike Evans got honorable mentions as good future pee-wee coaches. At the NFL Scouting Combine, last week Aditi Kinkhabwala of CBC asked Bowles to name his current player that he would call first if his car broke down and he needed help with a flat tire. Bowles went right to Will Gholston: “Very loyal. Understands it. City kid. Should know something about cars. He’ll take care of it.” Bowles added that he’s confident Gholston would have a jack. Gholston, the 12-season Buccaneers veteran defensive tackle, is a pending free agent and, per Joe’s knowledge, wants to make it 13. He turns 34 in July and it will be interesting to see if the Bucs think Gholston still has gas in the tank. If not, well, then Gholston will have plenty of time to help Bowles in an emergency. |2025-03-02 09:37:00|200|14|8|Will Gholston|Bowles trusts Gholston to help in emergencies.|5|Mixed sentiment towards current players with a hint of optimism for future acquisitions.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""JimBobBuc"", ""post"": ""Will\u2019s been a great player and leader for the Bucs.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/espn-jamel-deans-needs-a-fresh-start-elsewhere/|ESPN: Jamel Dean Needs A Fresh Start Elsewhere|Last March, ESPN NFL insider Jeremy Fowler reported the Bucs were open to trading a starting cornerback as Carlton Davis or Jamel Dean were being shopped. Sure enough, three days later, the Bucs traded Davis to the Lions. If the Bucs traded a starting corner a year ago, would they be willing to do it again? Over at ESPN, each team’s beat writer offered one player that could use a change of scenery, a guy better off with another team this fall. Jenna Laine thinks Dean is that man, mostly because she thinks he may not be fulfilling his end of his contract. This is less about a change of scenery and more about Dean’s inability to stay healthy with a giant $15.2 million salary cap hit in 2025. Dean has been called a great teammate and a hard worker, and it’s rare to find a player with his length and speed. But he has missed 18 games in six seasons — missing nine in the past two years. Plus, he’s had one interception the past two years, which is an area where the team has been trying to improve. The Bucs’ defense is better when Dean is on the field, but he’s not contributing if he’s sidelined. The team already parted with CB Carlton Davis III last year, and that trade to Detroit served him well. If Joe had a cold beer every time Bucs coach Todd Bowles last week in Indiana sad, “ballhawk,” Joe would have a helluva Sunday afternoon. Dean is no ball hawk. Not remotely close. If Bowles truly believes the way to improve one of the more woeful pass defenses the past two seasons is to get more picks, it sure smells like Dean is an endangered species with the Bucs. That is, unless he reworks his contract.|2025-03-02 08:05:00|303|23|3|Jamel Dean|ESPN article suggests Dean may need a fresh start.|3|Mixed reactions towards Dean, criticism of coaching, desire for a new CB, disappointment in past decisions.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Truth be Told"", ""post"": ""Way overpaid.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/up-next-chris-godwin-mystery/|Up Next: Chris Godwin Mystery|So the combine is over, at least the combine that NFL media attends. Joe’s not referencing the indoor track practice TV show. Illegal tampering happened last week in Indianapolis. A number of team shot-callers are back at their home base. For example, Bucs AC/DC-loving general manager Jason Licht left Indiana on Friday. Todd Bowles left no later than Saturday morning as he threw out the first pitch at a New York Yankees spring training game. At least one other Bucs personnel executive left yesterday. (He was on Joe’s flight and nearly ran Joe over on the jet bridge as Joe was allowing a woman in a scooter ample time and space to board the plane. Joe’s not sure what the rush was, it wasn’t like the plane was on the runway). So the Bucs are in free agent mode now as the free agency dinner bell rings next week. Matt Verderame of SI.com is trying to figure out what will happen to each NFL team’s most important free agent. With the Bucs, Verderame thinks at the end of the day, the Bucs and Godwin find a way to hash out a multi-year contract. Just the body language Joe saw with Licht and Bowles in Indianapolis, it seems they are spooked by Godwin’s injury. In a perfect world, a deal would already be done. But this isn’t a perfect world now as no one really knows if Godwin is anything close to 100 percent healthy from a dislocated ankle. If any team would know, it would be the Bucs. So the hesitation from both Licht and Bowles seems to suggest the ankle and Godwin’s rehab has the Bucs freaked out a little. Of course, free agency doesn’t happen until March 12. So maybe the Bucs get some good medical news about Godwin in the next 10 days.|2025-03-02 00:00:00|306|26|7|Chris Godwin|Bucs assess Chris Godwin's injury and potential contract negotiations.|4|Mixed sentiments with caution towards Godwin's return due to injury concerns and uncertainty.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Godlovesbucs"", ""post"": ""Or by being a little iffy they drive his price down a tad.
