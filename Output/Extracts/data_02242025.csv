The silly season of the offseason officially ramps up with team executives plotting, scheming, angling, misdirecting and investigating for the defining moves ahead. So Joe thinks this is a great time to roll out a multi-part series on Buccaneers Ring of Honor general manager Jason Licht. Joe’s talked to a lot of people about Licht with a focus on Licht’s defining moves that turned the Bucs into a Super Bowl champ and a lasting contender that’s since won four consecutive division titles. Joe asked new Raiders general manager John Spytek, the former Bucs assistant GM, to share what he thinks was the Bucs’ most critical free agent move of the Licht regime not named “Tom Brady.” Licht set out to assess well-known failures, overhaul the team mentality and step out of a norm, Spytek said. The result was a slightly surprising move on the offensive line in March of 2018. “No. 1, Ryan Jensen,” Spytek said with conviction. “When we were looking at what we wanted to get accomplished there — and it kind of like fit right with when we were really trying to organizationally and from a scouting standpoint trying to really self-assess, be really self-aware about why had failed. “The free agent signings, the draft picks, everyone was aware of the names that didn’t pan out. What were we missing? We were looking for somebody that was kind an enforcer. Somebody that had been through some sh*t in their life, but from a life standpoint and a football standpoint, and came from a great organization. Ryan Jensen fit that. “We made a decision there, that had not been something we typically do, dive in and pay the top of the market. We made him the highest paid center. And here’s a guy, ‘Is he a guard? Is he a center? What is he?’ “I think that was the start of kind of the re-branding of the Bucs and who we became, which was this hard-nosed tough, we’re-not-going-to-take-sh*t-from-anybody signing. “I thought without a doubt, while he was here and he was healthy, he was the best center in the NFL.” Spytek went on to say being the highest paid center meant something to Jensen and it wasn’t about the giant paycheck. Jensen was the right guy from the neck up. He was driven by that confidence shown by Licht, and by fulfilling what Licht and the staff wanted from him. Tomorrow, Joe will dive into another “re-branding” move by Licht, one born from an in-house method at One Buc Palace and unique foresight.|2025-02-24 20:17:00|432|19|7|Jason Licht|Licht's critical free agent move re-branded the Bucs successfully.|8|Mostly positive comments with praise for Jensen, Licht, and the team's recent improvements.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Ryan"", ""post"": ""Good post.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/368541/|Is It Possible For The Offense To Improve?|So what should Joe expect from the Bucs offense this fall and specifically new offensive coordinator Josh Grizzard? First, Joe would like to see the full roster. Who knows if the Bucs can keep Chris Godwin and Ben Bredeson? Who knows if the Bucs add another receiver? If the 2025 offense remains intact, then Joe has every reason to think the Bucs offense will be good again. Will it be as good as in 2024? That may be a tall task. The Bucs had a wildly successful offense, better than any could have imagined at this time last year. It’s awfully hard to improve on third-best. But rookie star Bucky Irving will be a year smarter and will start the season as the Bucs’ true No. 1 running back, unlike last season. Graham Barton, Joe believes, surely will be better. Remember, Barton started at center for the first time since he was a freshman at Duke. Then there is receiver Jalen McMillan. He came on very strong in the final weeks of 2024. He ought to be better, so long as he can adjust to now having defenses keying on him. The wild card is Grizzard. Joe is confident he will keep the core of Liam Coen’s offense. But will Grizzard’s fingerprints on the offense enhance it or pull it back? Regression to the mean could be logical and so could an improvement. The Bucs, remember, didn’t have Godwin after Week 7 last season.|2025-02-24 10:30:00|244|35|7|The Bucs offense|Potential improvements and uncertainties for the upcoming season.|5|Mixed opinions on offense: some optimistic about improvement, others expect regression and challenges.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Lt.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/free-agency-countdown-14-days-the-bucs-and-donte-jackson/|Free Agency Countdown: 14 Days — The Bucs And Donte Jackson|A sect of Bucs fans runs through random Winn-Dixie aisles screaming about how if the Buccaneers cut Jamel Dean, the team will save roughly $8.5 million in salary cap space next season. Dean has lost a lot of fans over the past couple of years. Between injuries, a big salary and a lack of big plays, many are ready to move on and thank the veteran Super Bowl cornerback for his service. Joe doesn’t rule out the Bucs re-negotiating Dean’s fat contract or flat out keeping him. Todd Bowles loves the guy. However, a credible report had Dean on the trade block one year ago. Regardless, the Bucs need a capable body at outside cornerback whether or not they keep brittle Dean. Bryce Hall was that guy last year but had a season-ending injury in Week 1. One guy on the market is veteran Donte Jackson. The Steelers traded for him last April and Jackson started 15 games and walked away with 5 interceptions. He’s a legit No. 2 cornerback who turns 30 in November. Bowles is no fan of shorter outside corners like Jackson (5-10) but Bowles is a fan of turnovers. Jackson has 19 career interceptions in seven seasons. For reference, that’s as many as Dean and former Bucs cornerback Carlton Davis combined. Jackson won’t be cheap but he wouldn’t break the bank, and the Bucs could do a lot worse opposite Zyon McCollum if they move on from Dean. The free agency frenzy kicks off on Monday, March 10 at noon. Early deals will be announced that afternoon and made official on Wednesday, March 12.|2025-02-24 10:29:00|268|21|7|Donte Jackson|Bucs consider replacing Jamel Dean with veteran Donte Jackson.|3|Mixed opinions on players and coaching strategies, with some bitterness and skepticism expressed.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""First Name Greatest"", ""post"": ""Licht values his picks and overpaying his picks"", ""post_time"": [""February"", ""24th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""10:34"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""JimBobBuc"", ""post"": ""Trade Dean, he\u2019s just not available enough.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/tristan-wirfs-discusses-changing-offenses-again/|Tristan Wirfs Discusses Changing Offenses (Again)|So it isn’t just Baker Mayfield who will have to break in a new offensive coordinator and learn a new offense. When Josh Grizzard was hired to replace departed Liam Coen, he became Baker Mayfield’s eighth different offensive coordinator since he was drafted No. 1 overall by the Browns in 2018. It hasn’t been consistent lately for Tristan Wirfs, either. Grizzard will be Wirfs’ fourth offensive coordinator in as many years. He spoke about the change with Ari Meirov of The 33rd Team earlier this month. “It’s kind of crazy,” Wirfs said. “I mean, [Mayfield] has had [eight] OCs. That’s insane. I’m at four. “If [Mayfield] can do eight, I can do four.” Wirfs admitted there was a learning curve going from Byron Leftwich to Dave Canales. That was also the same year Wirfs flipped from right tackle to left. Wirfs told Meirov he doesn’t expect much of a change this year. “We’re not the [same] system, but it hasn’t really changed much,” Wirfs said. “I think the big change was from Byron to Dave. “Now with ‘Griz,’ he was here. I just assume stuff is not going to change drastically. Maybe some terminology, you know you might change a little bit of stuff. “But the base [offense], I’m confident about it.” Joe thinks that’s a big reason why the Bucs chose Grizzard. He was here. He saw how things worked. And they worked very, very well. Joe is a big believer in not fixing something that’s not broken. The Bucs offense is not broken. Sure, Grizzard may tweak things, that’s expected. But like Wirfs, Joe is certain the offense will be similar.  |2025-02-24 04:05:00|273|8|5|Tristan Wirfs|Wirfs adjusting to new offensive coordinator|5|Variety in play calling praised, mixed confidence in new OC transition, past successes mentioned.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Pickgrin"", ""post"": ""Having the same OLine coaches, QB coach etc with everyone working together and on the same page \u2013 running a very similar type of offense with probably the same terminology \u2013 will make this \u201cnew OC transition\u201d a breeze for most of these guys."", ""post_time"": [""February"", ""24th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""7:40"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""BA\u2019s Red Pen"", ""post"": ""The Offense will be fine.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/hainsey/|Robert Hainsey’s Leadership Role Last Season|One thing former Bucs head coach Dirk Koetter used to talk about was valuable players called “glue guys.” He believed a team could not become a winner without those “glue guys.” Specifically, Koetter was referencing Will Gholston. Koetter went on to explain glue guys may not be stars but you can bank on their play. They’re guys that show up, are team-first players and will always answer the bell. On the Bucs’ roster in 2024, Joe considered K.J. Britt and Robert Hainsey to be glue guys. True, Britt probably isn’t a starting linebacker in the NFL. But Joe loves the guy’s heart and attitude. If you could take Britt’s heart and ‘tude and put it in a better, more athletic body, you’d probably have another Lavonte David. Now Joe can hear folks moaning out loud because Joe called Hainsey a “glue guy.” Hainsey became a lightning rod for many fans, on whom they pinned the blame for Rachaad White’s awful running somehow. Clearly, the Bucs drafted Graham Barton to replace Hainsey. Joe will never forget there were two players in the front lobby of One Buc Palace to greet Barton when he first arrived at One Buc Palace: Tristan Wirfs and the guy Barton was drafted to replace, Hainsey. Now that’s a team man. Hainsey knew Barton was taking his job. But there he was repping the Bucs, welcoming Barton. Joe asked Hainsey about that gesture toward the end of the season. “I mean, it’s very normal, ” Hainsey said. “Like, my goal has always been in college, the No. 1 goal is to help the team. That’s kind of who I am and who I’ve always tried to be. “I have always been a starter, and that was kind of the role, and I had to make a decision, ‘Am I going to change who I am? Because things didn’t go necessarily the way I wanted top?’ “I was like, ‘No. That’s not who I am. That’s not how I was raised, that’s not what I do.'” Being a team guy wasn’t just limited to One Buc Palace. Former Bucs offensive coordinator Liam Coen said he would sometimes, when putting together a gameplan, call Hainsey at home and get his thoughts on a particular install. “I call Hainsey when we’re trying to create our protection plan,” Coen said last month. “I’ve called him on multiple occasions while he’s at home and asked him how he would see it.” Hainsey said it wasn’t in him to feel sorry for himself because the Bucs drafted Barton. He wasn’t going to mope and just collect a paycheck. “It’s a tough situation, but like, you can either kind of sink in your shell and sulk about things, or you can make the most out of it, because bad sh!t is gonna happen to everyone one way or another,” Hainsey said. “And as far as things that could happen, like in the grand scheme of life, [losing a starting job] is nothing. I just need to make the most of it.” Hainsey is a free agent in about two weeks. Would he like to start? Of course. Hainsey wouldn’t tell Joe if he looking forward to leaving or wanted to stick around and be a valuable glue guy in a reserve role. Hainsey said he’d worry about that after the season. Of course, Wirfs, who is tight with Hainsey, told “The Pivot” podcast during Super Bowl week that Hainsey is “leaving.” That’s too bad. The Bucs will be losing a quality team-first guy. A glue guy.|2025-02-24 03:45:00|592|25|7|Robert Hainsey|Valuable team player; selfless|8|Fans generally positive about Hainsey but anticipate his departure, some discussion on retaining Bredeson.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Hodad"", ""post"": ""Don\u2019t know what their center situation is in J Ville, but signing Hainsey could really help installing Coen\u2019s offense.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/receiver-isnt-a-major-need/|Receiver Isn’t A Major Need|The way Joe looks at it, the Bucs need to do the following with the No. 19 pick in April’s draft, and Joe can sum it up in three words: Defense, defense, defense. That doesn’t mean there may not be a hole on offense. Walter Cherepinsky, the Oz behind WalterFootball.com, seems to believe receiver may be a bigger need than Joe believes. Wide Receiver: The Buccaneers could stand to add some depth at receiver behind Mike Evans and Jalen McMillan if Chris Godwin leaves via free agency. Joe first has to see what Chris Godwin does. If he leaves, yeah, that’s a hole, unless the Bucs believe that promising second-year receiver Jalen McMillan, who came on strong in the final weeks of the season, is ready to step in as the Bucs’ No. 2 receiver. McMillan might be, but Joe isn’t there yet and would like to see how McMillan progresses. Could the Bucs use depth behind Mike Evans and McMillan? Of course. While Sterling Shepard was OK coming off the bench, he made enough boneheaded mistakes to make Joe squirm. If the Bucs want to draft another receiver on the third day of the draft, Joe wouldn’t be upset by that. If Godwin leaves, Joe wouldn’t be mad if the Bucs AC/DC-loving general manager Jason Licht used a second-day pick on a receiver. Joe wonders if pending free agent Tyler Boyd has any gas left in the tank. When he wasn’t the focus of attention from defenses in Cincinnati, Boyd put up damn good numbers. Of course, Boyd is 30. That’s when most receivers see production fall off the cliff.|2025-02-24 00:00:00|271|37|7|Receiver|Draft focus on defense but receiver depth might be needed.|6|Mixed opinions on addressing defense, concerns about current roster but optimism for improvements.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Defense Rules"", ""post"": ""Joe \u2026 \u2018Defense, defense, defense.\u2019"", ""post_time"": [""February"", ""24th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""12:26"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""OHBucFan"", ""post"": ""Amen and amen."", ""post_time"": [""February"", ""24th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""1:25"", ""am""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""garro"", ""post"": ""Unless we are just building for the future and have decided we are not going for the Super Bowl this year we need to fix the defense.
