https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/banged-up-bucky-irving-heads-bucs-injury-list/|Banged Up Bucky Irving Heads Bucs’ Injury List|The mic’d up feature on Bucky Irving from Sunday’s beating of the Panthers showed a scene of Irving’s leg being wrapped in something that looked like it was once used by Alaskan natives to heal a wounded elder.  It seems now there’s a little more clarity as to what was going on. Irving is listed on today’s official injury report with shoulder and shin issues. The Bucs only held a walk-through practice today at One Buc Palace, but if it had been a real practice, Irving would have been limited. Ruled “out” for today was cornerback Jamel Dean and safety Antoine Winfield with their respective knee issues. Also out were tight ends Cade Otton (knee) and Payne Durham (quad). Limited was No. 3 tight end Devin Culp (ribs), DT William Gholston (knee), receiver Sterling Shepard (hamstring) and left tackle Tristan Wirfs (foot, knee). Mike Evans had a rest day.|2025-01-01 17:01:00|149|42|4|Bucky Irving|Numerous injuries plague Bucs|4|Mixed sentiment towards Bucky's status ranging from cautious optimism to concerns about overuse potential.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Jmarkbuc"", ""post"": ""Vita gonna play TE?"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""1st,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""5:08"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Eric"", ""post"": ""Cade will probably practice tommorow  and friday  durham hopefully just precautionary"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""1st,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""5:34"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""Jeebs the Honey Bear"", ""post"": ""This is a game to rest Bucky.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/the-saints-and-liam-coen/|The Saints And Liam Coen|Joe has yet to receive word that Liam Coen has received or accepted a Team Glazer offer he can’t refuse to continue calling plays for the Bucs next season. Hopefully, that good news arrives next week. Yes, Coen is under contract as Bucs offensive coordinator for next season, but there’s legitmate fear he may leave the building for a head coaching gig. It has a lot to do with the Bucs’ high-octane, highly-diverse and high-achieving offense. A 39-year-old from the famed Sean McVay coaching tree, Coen is a hot name as interview season approaches. And what 39-year-old Kevin O’Connell has done in Minnesota has to be fanning those flames. O’Connell worked alongside Coen with the Rams. So that brings Joe to the slimy Saints. The Saints have a quality general manager, stable ownership and they already fired their defense-first head coach of the last three seasons (2022-2024). It’s a safe bet New Orleans has its eye on a young offensive mind or two for its vacancy. Might that be Coen? And is Coen showcasing himself Sunday for Saints management in the Bucs’ must-win game against the Saints in Tampa? Joe thinks the Saints gig could be attractive to Coen from the standpoint of stability, as the Saints have been patient with head coaches. The Saints are in an absolute salary cap mess that won’t be fixed for a couple of years, and they’re probably stuck with QB Derek Carr for one more season, but the Saints’ heirarchy seems like one that would be realistic about its rebuild mode and would let Coen operate accordingly. Joe likes Coen and has no interest in him landing in New Orleans, but Joe does think it’s certainly a sleeper Coen landing spot.|2025-01-01 14:34:00|288|76|6|Liam Coen|Coen's potential move to Saints causes speculation and concern.|3|Concern, uncertainty, mixed emotions in response to potential coaching changes and division competitiveness.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Cometowin2"", ""post"": ""We need to keep Coen no matter what.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/if-we-win-mikes-getting-the-record/|“If We Win, Mike’s Getting The Record”|So Baker Mayfield had an interesting twist today on the balancing act the Bucs will perform on Sunday. A win is necessary to secure a playoff spot, and Mike Evans getting 85 yards receiving is required for him to tie Jerry Rice’s all-time record of 11 consecutive seasons of 1,000 or more yards receiving. It’s a record that’s stood since 1996. Mayfield said getting Evans involved in the offense early and effectively is always key to the Bucs’ winning, so it’s no balancing act. “If we win, Mike’s getting the record,” Mayfield said. Sorry, Baker, the math is not on your side. The Bucs have won five games this season when Evans played and did not get 85 or more yards receiving. The Bucs probably will need to make an extra effort to get Evans the ball in this game. Joe just hopes Evans clears the record early and avoids cheap hits from the slimy and dirty Saints. Fair warning: If Todd Bowles giving away Evans’ six-yard catch last game by needlessly accepting a fourth-quarter penalty ends up being a factor in Evans missing the record, or him potentially getting injured in garbage time on Sunday, Joe will be going wild in this space.|2025-01-01 13:43:00|204|43|6|Baker Mayfield|Playoffs hinge on Mike Evans breaking receiving record.|4|Mixed sentiments on focusing on individual records vs. team wins, with emphasis on team success.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""gp"", ""post"": ""Two go routes will get him close, if not there.

On Friday, Tampa Bay re-signed Bucs sacks king Shaq Barrett and he was a chief cheerleader during Sunday’s beatdown of the Panthers. But Bowles suggested on the Buccaneers Radio Network that Barrett was a lot more than that. Bowles thinks the Bucs’ five-sack explosion had something to do with the presence of Barrett. Whether fellow outside linebackers were worried about playing or had been coached up by Shaq, Bowels wasn’t sure, but he definitely enjoyed it. “Shaq has been so instrumental in a lot of things we’ve done here on and off the field. You don’t see the things he does for the defense off the field as far as getting guys ready to play, understanding what’s coming at them and teaching them the finer points of pass rushing or pass drops, or what to look for,” Bowles said. “Just getting him back out there and getting him out in practice this week just to see how he can help us, he’s going to be outstanding. He’s fired up. We’re fired up. I can’t wait to see him.” Joe doesn’t underestimate the value of Coach Shaq. He was an understudy of future Hall of Famer Von Miller in Denver and then came to the Bucs in 2019 and exploded. Last year, YaYa Diaby gave Shaq a ton of credit for his 7 1/2-sack rookie season. And perhaps it’s no coincidence that Diaby’s sack total is 3 1/2 this season — while Shaq was retired. Joe is just happy Shaq is back. If he hasn’t lost his first step, then there’s a solid shot his fresh legs might hold up for another five (?) games as a situational pass rusher.|2025-01-01 10:47:00|293|32|8|Shaq Barrett|Bucs excited about Shaq's impact on defense.|6|Mixed feelings on Shaq's return and coaching implications, with some optimism and disappointment expressed.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""adam from ny"", ""post"": ""yes shaq is back\u2026to kung foo some qb\u2019s quick fast and in a hurry"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""1st,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""10:51"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Lt.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/todd-bowles-addresses-playing-for-mike-evans-streak/|Todd Bowles Addresses Playing For Mike Evans’ Streak|Yes, there is unwanted stress at One Buc Palace.  The greatest receiver in Buccaneers history, Mike Evans, is 85 receiving yards from 1,000 this season. If he gets to 1,000, it will mark 11 consecutive years and tie the all-time NFL record held by legendary Jerry Rice (1986-1996). Unfortunately, a hamstring injury cost Evans 3 1/2 games this season and Todd Bowles stole six yards from him on Sunday. The Bucs have a must-win game against the slimy Saints on Sunday in order to make the playoffs and win the NFC South crown. So the Bucs simply cannot go overboard to get Evans his record unless the game is out of reach (hopefully in the appropriate direction). Winning Sunday is more important than Evans’ record. Still, there’s no reason the Bucs can’t get both done. Head coach Todd Bowles addessed the situation on the Buccaneers Radio Network yesterday. “We’re very aware of [the streak] but we also are aware we have to win the ballgame,” Bowles said.” “So within the scheme, we have to try to get him those yards, and everybody wants him to get them. But we want to win the ballgame just as much, even more so. And if we can do that and get him his yards, that’d be great.” Yeah, Joe’s still pissed about those six yards lost on Sunday. Bowles was aware of the streak then, right? It was a blowout in the fourth quarter at the time. The good news is the Bucs are 4-0 this season when Evans gets four or more targets, and Evans had more than 85 yards receiving in all of those games. The bad news is the slimy Saints are an evil team and surely want to screw up Evans — mentally and physically — and do whatever it takes to make sure Evans misses the record or pays a nasty price for getting it. Joe hopes Evans gets a couple of short throws on the Bucs’ opening drive, say 8 or 9 yards each. That should calm him a bit and lower his bar to a more manageable total. For those who don’t follow every NFL move, Saints cornerback Marshon Lattimore, a longtime Evans rival, was traded to Washington in November.|2025-01-01 10:20:00|374|41|4|Todd Bowles|Evans' record and Bucs' must-win game discussed.|3|Mixed feelings about game decisions and focus on reaching milestones.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""SB~LV"", ""post"": ""Yep \u201c Winning is more important than personal records.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/__trashed-7/|Jason Licht > Bill Belichick?|Joe understands people kvetch about Bucs AC/DC-loving general manager Jason Light for this transaction not made or that transaction not made. However, Licht is outperforming a living legend, and it’s one reason why that legend can no longer find a gig in the NFL and had to scurry off to the ACC to find work despite all of his jewelry. Licht once worked for Bill Belichick in New England. And it appears Licht learned how to replace an icon that Belichick could not. Both men had Tom Brady playing quarterback. Both men won rings because of Brady. But, as Albert Breer of SI.com points out, Belichick never could find a quarterback to sort of replace Brady. Licht has. Not solving the quarterback position is why Belichick is now at the University of North Carolina (and not the Stinking Panthers). And Baker Mayfield is a big reason Licht has plenty of job security. The Buccaneers now have two winning seasons in two years after Brady’s retirement, which is more than the Patriots have mustered in five. They could win their second division title in as many years after No. 12 walked out the door—the Patriots are 0-for-5 in that category. And, impressively, they’ve gone from having one of the oldest rosters in the league to one of the youngest this year (they ranked second before the season), without taking a step back. And, the Bucs have a better record than when Brady last played in the wild card round for the 2022 season. So yeah, as Belichick himself said on the Manning Bros Show a few weeks ago, Licht has done “a great job” losing the greatest quarterback of all time, as well as key stars, and still fielding a division winner while not missing the playoffs.|2025-01-01 10:00:00|296|18|7|Jason Licht|Licht outperforms Belichick by replacing Brady successfully.|5|Mixed sentiment towards team leadership and performance.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""FrontFour"", ""post"": ""And doing it with significant dead cap money.

The Cowboys sure wanted to play the Bucs, didn’t they? So Joe admits to cringing when reading follicly-challenged Billy Barnwell of BSPN listing the teams that opponents won’t want to face in the playoffs. Billy has the Bucs at No. 4. I’d also gently point out that the other victories in this [Bucs] winning streak came over the Giants, Raiders and in a home-and-home vs. the Panthers, which isn’t exactly playoff-caliber competition. Then again, this Tampa Bay team beat the Lions and Eagles in September, took the Chiefs to overtime and has a quarterback in Baker Mayfield who has thrown for 260-plus yards and three touchdowns in three of his four playoff starts. Ask the Eagles whether they want to see the Bucs again after what has happened the past two times they’ve played them. After the debacle in North Texas, Joe isn’t interesting in reading how any team doesn’t want to play the Bucs. If Dallas can beat them, then the Lions, Vikings, Packers and Rams sure as hell can. There is something weird about this Bucs team that since Week 2, every time they have a good game against a good team, the very next week they lay a rotten egg.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/bucky-irving-alvin-kamara/|Bucky Irving = Alvin Kamara|Joe still gets the shivers when thinking about the 2017 draft. Joe went round and round almost daily with a reader about who the Bucs should draft. This guy Joe crossed swords with was absolutely, totally in love with O.J. Howard. Joe thought drafting him was irresponsible. The Bucs already had a quality Pro Bowl-level tight end in Cam Brate, who the previous season led the NFL in touchdown catches for tight ends. In other words, Howard would be a luxury pick and the Bucs had way, way too many holes on the roster to address. The Bucs had a nauseating hole at running back, Joe beleived, and Joe was screaming for Dalvin Cook. Joe sweated and barfed his way through round after round, incredulous how the Bucs could fully ignore running back. Finally, too late, Joe fretted, the Bucs got a running back. SnoopDog McPlaybook, who wanted nothing to do with the Bucs and bolted after training camp (recorded on “Hard Knocks” no less) when the Bucs didn’t protect him. Well, one of many running backs that spring who wasn’t good enough for the Bucs was Tennessee running back Alvin Kamara. He led the NFL in yards per carry as a rookie in 2017. In short, he was good. Seven years later, it appears the Bucs did get Kamara. Or at least his clone. Per The 33rd Team, two running backs this century have racked up 1,400 yards from scrimmage in less than 250 touches. Here are the two: 1. Alvin Kamara. 2. Bucky Irving. While Joe is long over the Bucs not drafting Cook (or T.J. Watt) and instead using their first-round pick on a luxury player (the Bucs have won the Super Bowl since and Cook never did — scoreboard, Bucs!) the Bucs finally got their Kamara.
