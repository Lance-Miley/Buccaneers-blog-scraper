There‚Äôs no 24-hour rule at JoeBucsFan.com world headquarters, though there is a one-hour rule for the cole slaw on the intern hot dog bar.You saw it. Joe saw it. And the video is below. Baker Mayfield made an insane play on fourth down with the game on the line and the Bucs still lost.Mayfield dragged beastly 49ers edge rusher Nick Bosa 10 steps to the sideline, buying time for a first-down throw. It was such a freakin‚Äô extraordinary play that Bosa was asked two questions about it in the 49ers locker room on Wednesday.Bosa sounded like a guy still in disbelief.‚ÄúOh man, (laughs) the slow motion makes it look pretty tough,‚Äù Bosa said. ‚ÄúYeah, it was weird because it was fourth down so I was thinking more, ‚ÄòIf I hold onto him I don‚Äôt think he can make a play. If I try and get him down, maybe go for his legs, then he could possibly get off me and throw it.‚Äô‚ÄúSo I figured [Mayfield] couldn‚Äôt make a play but he definitely did.‚ÄùMan, what a waste of a historic play that turned out to me.Joe also monitored other 49ers stuff this week, including the YouTube channel of All-Pro linebacker Fred Warner.Warner offered a look back at the Sunday‚Äôs game and focused time on all those 49ers fans in Tampa (making far too much noise for Joe‚Äôs taste).‚ÄúBoy, did the faithful show up for this game,‚Äù Warner said. ‚ÄúThroughout the game you see me waving my arms in the air on third down, like late in the game, because that‚Äôs how loud it was for us and having our fans behind us.‚ÄùHearing that made Joe want to puke. But that‚Äôs just how it is this season in Tampa. Even 49ers fans are being loud at The Licht House. And yeah, they were loud.Warner added that the Bucs were a physical test and he called the game a ‚Äúslugfest‚Äù victory that the 49ers will carry with them as an uplifting force all season.BAKER & RACHAAD KEEP IT ALIVE ü§Ø|2024-11-15 23:19:00|347|47|3|Nick Bosa|Bosa amazed by Mayfield play; Fred Warner praises 49ers fans.|'2| Frustrations and criticisms with some pockets of hope and support.'|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Dave Pear"", ""post"": ""Thank Lovie for another megachoke.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/11/blame-the-second-down-defense/|Blame The Second-Down Defense|In half the Bucs‚Äô losses, including the past two, the Tampa Bay defense choked away the game like gagging dogs.Final drives of the game turned out to be a losing drive for the Bucs defense. That‚Äôs not a good thing when your head coach is a defensive-minded guy and for all intents and purposes, he‚Äôs the defensive coordinator.Peeling skins off the onion, the PFF tribe, specifically this Timo Riske, documents how only a handful of teams cough up more first downs than the Bucs.Some 73 percent of series are converted into first downs on the Bucs defense. That puts the Bucs in a six-way tie for sixth-worse. Only the Cardinals, Commandos and Crows are likely playoff-bound teams that are as bad as the Bucs in allowing conversions, or worse.(No, Joe‚Äôs not saying the Bucs are a likely playoff team.)It seems second-down defense is the biggest culprit. Of the series‚Äô in which opponents have converted a first down, 28 percent have come on second down.On third down, the Bucs appear to be fine. A number of the best defenses in preventing conversions allow a higher percentage of third down conversions than the Bucs.So whatever the Bucs are doing on second down, hopefully Bucs coach Todd Bowles, during this bye week break, figures out a different course of action.|2024-11-15 19:48:00|217|21|3|Bucs|Bucs defense struggles on second-down conversions.|1| Mixed sentiments on Buccaneers defense performance.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/11/todd-bowles-picked-a-defensive-star-of-the-game/|Todd Bowles Picked A Defensive Star Of The Game|The positives within the Bucs defense are much harder to find these days.That‚Äôs what happens when you‚Äôre riding a four-game losing streak and your defense is allowing an average of 31.25 points per game.Tampa Bay head coach/defensive chieftain Todd Bowles watches every game‚Äôs film many, many times and he had no problem picking out a major defensive highlight Sunday versus the 49ers.Bowles ‚Äî twice ‚Äî¬† went to backup nickel cornerback Christian Izien during the head coach‚Äôs sitdown on the Buccaneers Radio Network. Izien started in place of injured Tykee Smith and really impressed his boss.‚ÄúI thought Izzy did a great job of getting hands on receivers all day,‚Äù Bowles said. ‚ÄúI tell you what, Izzy stepped in and he played probably the best game on defense.‚ÄúI thought Izzy was very physical with the receivers. He covered. He tackled. He blitzed. He understood the gameplan. He executed everything that we talked about during the week. I thought it was one of his best games since he‚Äôs been here.‚ÄùJoe‚Äôs a big Izien fan. The guy has stepped up various times in various ways. He‚Äôs an undrafted warrior who has proven himself through 26 games plus a postseason.Izien won‚Äôt be confused with a Pro Bowler, but he‚Äôs made the most of his limited size. Rutgers listed him at 5-8 at his Pro Day; the Bucs magically have him at 5-10.Given how much the Bucs have been struggling in their secondary, Joe hopes the Bucs find ways to get Izien on the field more when Smith returns to the lineup, which is likely to be imminent.|2024-11-15 18:53:00|262|13|8|Todd Bowles|Defensive standout Izzy impresses Buccaneers coach in win.|3| Mixed feelings about defense and coaching.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/11/sense-of-calm/|‚ÄúSense Of Calm‚Äù|For Bucs fans, there is a whole lotta hope and prayer to be banked on the next seven weeks.The Bucs are 4-6. They are effectively three games behind Atlanta in the division race as the Dixie Chicks hold the tiebreaker.The Bucs are just one win better than the lowly Stinking Panthers and the bottom-feeding slimy Saints.That‚Äôs right. Former Bucs offensive coordinator and Stinking Panthers coach Dave Canales is nipping at the Bucs‚Äô heels with a team that arguably has the worst talent of any roster in the league.Jenna Laine of ESPN sort of takes the temperature of the Bucs‚Äô locker room as players headed off to enjoy their bye week.Tangible second-half goal: Make the playoffs. Despite being without Evans, Godwin and cornerback Jamel Dean (Evans and Dean are expected to return), there‚Äôs a sense of calm because, as several players have noted, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been here before.‚Äù The Bucs won five out of their last six games last season to win the NFC South, and they face only one winning team after their Week 11 bye.Just because the Bucs caught fire in the second half last year doesn‚Äôt mean that will automatically happen this year. Last year the Bucs had Mike Evans and Chris Godwin on the field. That‚Äôs not the case the next seven weeks.Joe has little trust because of the way the Bucs are playing defense, or not playing defense. Joe doesn‚Äôt give two s(p)its what the record of the opponent is.If a defense can‚Äôt stop teams, trying to cobble together a 6-1 run to finish the regular season is awfully challenging.|2024-11-15 14:00:00|263|37|6|Bucs|Mixed optimism and skepticism for playoff hopes.|2| Mixed sentiments on team performance and coaching with a slight lean towards pessimism.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Bojim"", ""post"": ""I\u2019m not real optimistic at all."", ""post_time"": ""November 15th, 2024 at 9:07 am""}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Permanently Moderated"", ""post"": ""They ought to be pizzed off instead of calm.

After last night‚Äôs Eagles win against the Commandoes, the Bucs numbers have improved. The New York Times model bumped the Bucs to 18 percent and NFL.com hiked Tampa Bay‚Äôs postseason chances to 37 percent.It‚Äôs all about the Bucs‚Äô remaining schedule. That explains why the Bucs, at 4-6, have much better odds of making the postseason than the Rams, Bears and Seahawks, which all have 4-5 records.NFL data analytics queen Cynthia Frelund freshly crafted her own data and has stamped the Bucs at 8.6 wins this season. Of course, there‚Äôs no such thing as a ‚Äú.6‚Äù victory, so that means she sees the Bucs losing three more games.Damn, if the Bucs actually lose three more games against the likes of the Giants, Panthers (twice) and Raiders, plus the imploding Cowboys and slimy Saints, then Joe will ready for big changes. That would be an unacceptable result.One thing, however, is very clear from all the data studies, a 10-7 record will be required to make the NFC postseason.((For those wondering, here‚Äôs the New York Times explanation of¬†its postseason probability numbers ‚Ä¶. ‚ÄúWe create an offensive and defensive projection for every NFL team from a linear regression model that incorporates various metrics, such as Expected Points Added and Success Rate. These projections estimate how many points each team would be expected to score and allow in a game against an average opponent at a neutral site. We then assign a probability of how likely a team is to win a given me by adjusting for opponent and location. Taking into account each team‚Äôs current record, health and remaining schedule, we use these game-by-game projections to simulate the rest of the season (including the playoffs) 100,000 times.‚Äù)|2024-11-15 13:28:00|313|40|9|Bucs|Bucs' playoff chances rise thanks to improved projections.|3| Mixed sentiments on playoffs|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Rover"", ""post"": ""I truly will not invest my feelings into the notion of us making the playoffs.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/11/cbs-zyon-mccollum-first-half-all-pro/|CBS: Zyon McCollum First Half All-Pro|One of the best surprises of the first 10 games was a guy Joe was really concerned about prior to the Bucs‚Äô season.That‚Äôs cornerback Zyon McCollum. Given his sketchy play as a backup, Joe almost thought Bucs coach Todd Bowles was reckless, anointing McCollum a starter after Carlton Davis was traded to Detroit.Couldn‚Äôt Bowles have held a competition?As it turned out, Bowles knew what he was doing. McCollum has been fantastic. It took 10 games for McCollum to have a bad game and that was last Sunday against the 49ers.As it turned out, McCollum was playing hurt with a bum hamstring and he couldn‚Äôt finish the game.McCollum has had such a good year that prickly Pete Prisco of CBS believes McCollum is now one of the best corners in the game.In a story published last week, Prisco named his first-half All-Pro team. McCollum is there.A lot of expected top corners, guys like Sauce Gardner of the Jets, have not played as well as anticipated. That allows a player like McCollum to get a spot with Surtain and Humphrey, two solid veterans also landing on the team. McCollum has been one of the bigger surprises this season, but the Bucs raved about him during the summer when I visited for camp.If the Bucs plan on making the playoffs, they have finish the final seven games no worse than 6-1. For that to happen, both Jamel Dean and McCollum have to be healthy, and stay healthy.If Josh Hayes and this Tyrek Funderburk are your Bucs starting corners, Joe‚Äôs got bad news: don‚Äôt plan on the playoffs.|2024-11-15 11:00:00|264|15|8|Zyon McCollum|McCollum exceeds expectations|5| Mixed reactions on team performance and coaches|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Brian in St Pete"", ""post"": ""He\u2019s been an amazing find.

The defense has choked away a game in three of them, including the past two games against the defending Super Bowl champs and the defending NFC champs (49ers).If the Bucs had won all four of those one-score games, they‚Äôd have the best record in the NFC (8-2), a half-game behind the Lions for the overall top seed.Even if the Bucs went 3-1 in those one-score games, the Bucs would be 7-3 and everyone in the Tampa Bay area would be talking about hosting a wild card round game.Instead, the defensive-minded head coach‚Äôs defense has played lousy ball and has painted the team into a corner, needing probably six wins in the final seven games to grab a wild card berth.|2024-11-15 08:45:00|163|31|2|The Bucs|Bucs struggle in one-score games|'2| Mixed opinions on team performance; Some hope for improvement|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Pink"", ""post"": ""The one that I can\u2019t get over is if this team was better at coin tosses, we\u2019d be 6-4 and leading the division"", ""post_time"": ""November 15th, 2024 at 4:25 am""}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Hodad"", ""post"": ""If the Bucs could win one score games.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/11/cade-otton-was-mr-separation/|Cade Otton Was Mr. Separation|Joe still tries to wrap his mind around how the Bucs can bounce back from the loss of Chris Godwin.Godwin was likely having not just his best season (which is saying something), but Godwin was arguably the team MVP.Why does Joe say that? The Bucs haven‚Äôt won since he got hurt against Baltimore.Talk about a gut punch.If there is any silver lining to that awful injury, it‚Äôs been the play of tight end Cade Otton, who really has raised his game. He‚Äôs become Baker Mayfield‚Äôs favorite target with Mike Evans and Godwin out.Joe could argue since Godwin got hurt, he has morphed into one of the best NFL tight ends.But wait, that‚Äôs not all! Whoever thought Otton had wheels? He‚Äôs got them and he‚Äôs finding ways to get open.Who says? The PFF tribe says.¬†Per the tribe, on each Otton targets against San Francisco, he got separation from his nearest defender.Left unsaid is whether or not the 49ers got cute and tried to cover Otton with a defensive tackle.Now Joe has to throw in a disclaimer. The tribe claims Otton had six ‚Äúopportunities,‚Äù whatever that means. Per the offensive NFL gamebook, Otton was targeted eight times, catching five passes.Pardon Joe for putting significantly more merit into the official NFL gamebook than some dude in an Irish dorm following a predetermined ‚Äúmetric.‚Äù¬†Still, the point here is that Otton is getting open. Often.His development this year has been a very bright spot in a depressing season through 10 games.|2024-11-15 05:00:00|248|9|7|Cade Otton|Otton shines as standout tight end amid team struggles.|5| Mixed sentiments on Otton's performance and development|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Jamesrunningwilder"", ""post"": ""I feel like since his 2nd year in the league, Otton has had the ability, he just hasn\u2019t had the opportunities with Evans and Godwin being so productive."", ""post_time"": ""November 15th, 2024 at 12:18 am""}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""FlBoy84"", ""post"": ""Really liked Otton\u2019s college tape when he was drafted, solid hands catcher who really plucked the ball for the most part.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/11/mike-edwards-returns/|Mike Edwards Returns|So the Bucs once again reached back into their history trying to find some magic. So far this year, all that reaching has done is give the Bucs a rash.Versatile safety Mike Edwards, 28, was signed this afternoon, the Bucs announced. The 2019 Bucs third-round pick was grabbed off waivers after the woeful Titans released him.Edwards also was released by the Bills earlier this month.In March, the Bucs brought back safety Jordan Whitehead and everyone from the highest reaches of One Buc Palace to the drunkest of Bucs fans in Lithia dive bars were giddy with the signing.¬†But Whitehead‚Äôs second stint with the Bucs hasn‚Äôt gone so well.Through 10 games, Whitehead has been far from the bone-crunching safety the Bucs had when they won the Super Bowl in the 2020 season.So combining how the Bucs may have buyer‚Äôs remorse with Whitehead, and how Edwards was cut twice this month, once from a truly rotten team, Joe wonders if reaching back for a productive player from years ago is a repeat of buyer‚Äôs remorse.Joe hopes not. Edwards was one of Joe‚Äôs favorite players.Joe sure hopes Todd Bowles can bring the magic out in the former ballhawk again.|2024-11-15 01:33:00|197|51|3|Mike Edwards|Bucs sign returning player amid mixed expectations|5| Fans have a mix of hope|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""rrsrqnc"", ""post"": ""Who\u2019s next, Sean Murphy Bunting"", ""post_time"": ""November 14th, 2024 at 8:35 pm""}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Waterboy"", ""post"": ""Can\u2019t be much worse than what they already have on defense."", ""post_time"": ""November 14th, 2024 at 8:38 pm""}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""Stillabucsfan"", ""post"": ""Maybe he\u2019ll tell the corners to stop playing so far off \ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffb"", ""post_time"": ""November 14th, 2024 at 8:42 pm""}, ""commenter3"": {""username"": ""DavidBigBucsFan99"", ""post"": ""Since we seem to have an opposite effect on players maybe he comes and plays great for us!
