https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/bobby-wagner-and-the-bucs/|Bobby Wagner And The Bucs|Joe brings this up for three distinct reasons. Future Hall of Fame linebacker Bobby Wagner will be on the field today leading the Washington defense in Philadelphia. At 34 years old, six months younger than Lavonte David, Wagner has had another stellar season. In 2022, Wagner was with the Rams. Last year, he was back in Seattle. This season? Washington on a one-year contract for $6.5 million. What about next season? Is Tampa a possibility for a win-now team desperate at inside linebacker? What triggered Joe about this, aside from the K.J. Britt/J.J. Russell experience, is a Commanders mic’d up segment tracking Wagner after his team beat the Bucs two weeks ago. Wagner, seemingly panicked that he couldn’t find Lavonte David, was asking Rachaad White if David is ok. Joe knows David and Wagner are close. David says they talk regularly and Wagner is on record explaining that David is an underappreciated Hall of Famer. Might Wagner decide to move on again this offseason and desire to play with his good friend? Stranger things have happened. Again, Joe believes the Bucs are approaching the 2025 season with a win-now mentality and will choose to use their limited free agency cash on defense after retaining in-house players.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/larry-foote-wont-leave-for-detroit/|Larry Foote Won’t Leave For Detroit DC Job|The shakeup coming to Todd Bowles’ defensive staff seems like it will be limited.  Yes, defensive line coach Kacy Rodgers bolted for the Lions (better job security or better pay, or both?). Rodgers worked with Lions head coach Dan Campbell in Miami. Bucs inside linebackers coach/pass defense coordinator Larry Foote, who had been on Bowles’ staff since 2019, interviewed for Lions’ defensive coordinator vacancy but did not get the job. The Lions promoted from within, per reports out of Detroit. Joe has heard change in the ranks of Bucs defensive coaches will not be widespread. Of course, that could shift if Bowles finds someone he thinks is special and, presumably, if the budget to replace Liam Coen is not a bank-breaker.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/bucs-hit-the-ground-running-with-offensive-coordinator-interviews/|Bucs Hit The Ground Running With Offensive Coordinator Interviews|The Bucs are one of 11 NFL teams without an offensive coordinator. So the Bucs can’t wallow in their tears over losing Liam Coen. They’ve got competition to fill Coen’s shoes. Joe noted on Twitter that former Bucs defensive tackle Booger McFarland said if he ran the Bucs, he would target three guys: 1. Whomever Sean McVay says is the best guy. 2. Whomever Kevin McConnell says is the best guy. 3. Chip Kelly. Well, it seems the Bucs and Booger are on the same page — at least with Nos. 1 and 2. Of the three candidates the Bucs interviewed yesterday, one is on McVay’s staff in Los Angeles and another is on O’Connell’s staff at Minnesota. And of course, the Bucs also interviewed a Jim Harbaugh assistant from Los Angeles. Those interviewed are Rams passing game specialist Nate Scheelhaase, Chargers passing game coordinator Marcus Brady, and Vikings assistant offensive coordinator Grant Udinski. None currently call plays. Scheelhaase did at Iowa State. Brady called plays for the Toronto Argonauts of the CFL. Udinski never has. Granted, 2023 Bucs offensive coordinator Dave Canales had never called plays before he came to Tampa Bay, either. Scheelhaase and Udinski are interesting because the work for two of the brightest offensive minds in the game. Coen, too, was from the McVay tree. Scheelhaase had good success at Iowa State. As a running backs coach and offensive coordinator Scheelhaase has churned out some pretty good talent, including David Montgomery and Breece Hall. He also worked with then-freshman quarterback Rocco Becht (son of former Bucs tight end Anthony Becht) in 2023. Scheelhaase groomed Becht to become the Big XII Freshman of the Year. For Joe, Scheelhaase, a former quarterback at Illinois, is the more interesting of the three. That’s because Scheelhaase has a documented ability to develop guys, at least in college, similar to Coen at Kentucky.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/uncertainty-surrounding-todd-bowles-makes-no-sense/|“Uncertainty Surrounding Todd Bowles” Makes No Sense|The math simply doesn’t add up for Joe on this take. Over at CBS, reporter Jonathan Jones typed up a story that sort of did a roundup of the top candidates for the 11 open offensive coordinator positions. (The competition explains why the Bucs have hit the ground running doing several interviews already.) Jones rattled off names of guys on the Bucs’ staff who could be candidates, and guys who are known to have already interviewed. And he added a very curious if not odd paragraph that the Bucs may have trouble filling the position because “uncertainty” with Todd Bowles is spooking would-be candidates. With uncertainty surrounding the long-term future of Todd Bowles in Tampa, some have wondered whether the Bucs will be able to get a top candidate this cycle. This makes no sense to Joe. Let’s just take a step back to a couple of days ago. The Bucs pitched an absolute fit because they felt backstabbed by Liam Coen as he ran off to Jacksonville. The Bucs clearly, badly, wanted him to stay and offered him a contract that would have made him the highest-paid offensive coordinator in the NFL. As much as the Bucs begged for Coen to stay, if there was truly uncertainty with Bowles, the Bucs either would have really made it worth Coen’s time to stay or, the Bucs would have nudged Bowles to retire (or both). Or at least the Bucs could have given Bowles a golden parachute, like, “Hey Todd, we want to move on, but here’s $10 million on top of what we already owe you as a retirement gift,” and possibly kept him the organziation like the Bucs are doing with Bucco Bruce Arians as a consultant. If there truly was unique “uncertainty” with Bowles (nearly every coach ultimately had a degree of uncertainty), then Team Glazer already would have named Coen head coach.

Year after year we win a terrible division. Be honest I doesn\u2019t take much to win the NFC south these last few years. This division is not the NFC north in 2024. We barely won the last 3 divisions, by, one game in 22, tie breaker in 23, 2 games in 24). Let\u2019s not forget it only took 8 wins in 22, and 9 in 23. 2. We consistently play to our opponents level. We can beat anyone any sunday\u2026.we can also lose to anyone any Sunday. We can go toe to toe with the best teams in the NFL. (We beat Philly and took the chiefs to overtime) we also narrowly beat the panthers the first game, and got our asses kicked by the cowboys despite a close score\u2026WE NEVER JUST PLAY OUR BEST. we have to make everything close. 3. Since we keep everything close in the last 3 years we are .500 in one score games\u2026.mediocre 4. Our defense is unprepared way too often. It doesn\u2019t matter who we have on the team. Rarely do we have a game where our defense plays well, most of the time we are can\u2019t stop anyone from going down the field with 30sec left for the walk off score when it matters. 5. Bowles game management is terrible, from taking the ball out of Tom bradys hands to his allergic attitude to time outs. The Washington game, use of the time outs on the final drive could have left us with a little bit of time. Instead todd let them use the entire clock and then score by refusing to use timeouts.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/bucs-no-4-rookie-class/|Bucs No. 4 Rookie Class|Joe knows Bucs fans are well aware of the 2024 rookie haul had by Bucs AC/DC-loving general manager Jason Licht. Here’s additional confirmation. Aaron Schatz, the developer of DVOA and the father of “Football Outsiders” (RIP), recently typed a story for the four-letter breaking down the best rookie classes of 2024. Schatz had the Bucs at No. 4. He really praised the Bucs rookies, including a guy Schatz believes has fully flown under the radar, nickel corner Tykee Smith. On defense, the quiet star was third-round pick Tykee Smith. Nominally a safety, Smith was Tampa Bay’s slot cornerback and finished a surprising sixth among qualifying cornerbacks in coverage. Smith sure looked like he slammed into the rookie wall and the wall won. But boy, did he show promise. Give Smith a full offseason of NFL conditioning and he should be ready for a 17- (or more) game schedule. Joe really likes what Smith brings to the table. Schatz had the top three rookie classes as the Rams’, the Commandos’ and the Chargers’.|2025-01-26 00:00:00|172|30|6|Tykee Smith|Bucs 2024 rookie class impresses with potential.|3|Mixed sentiment with some positive and negative comments about team performance and management.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""DoooshLaRue"", ""post"": ""I\u2019m a fan.
