https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/11/at-the-end-of-the-day-its-the-baker-mayfield-show/|“At The End Of The Day It’s The Baker Mayfield Show”|A man who bleeds New York Giants blue and works for the team can’t convince himself that the Giants can and will beat the Bucs on Sunday.  Bob Papa has been the Giants’ radio play-by-play guy for 30 years and has worked for the team in other capacities. He’s also heard hosting weekly on SiriusXM NFL Radio. Picking winners and losers for Week 12 today, Papa said he tried to find it in himself to pick the Giants but he can’t. Two big reasons were on Papa’s mind. First, the Giants run defense is horrid, as Papa described it. He noted that the Giants have allowed 894 rushing yards in the past five games: “And until they show that they can stop [the run], I can’t believe it.” Papa added that even if Giants replacement QB Tommy DeVito gives the team a spark, he doesn’t think it will overcome the many deficiencies of the Giants defense. Papa also thinks Baker Mayfield will be a scrambling threat and pick apart the Giants’ weak secondary just enough. “At the end of the day, it’s the Baker Mayfield show,” he said. Joe agrees that it is time for Mayfield to put the Bucs on his back. He’s certainly played well, but this is a game he cannot allow his team to lose. The Bucs’ run game should dominate — the Giants allow a league-worst 5.3 yards per carry — but Mayfield will have opportunities that a true franchise QB needs to make to bury a poor team.|2024-11-22 17:15:00|254|19|3|Baker Mayfield|Doubtful outlook on Giants vs. Bucs game.|7|Mixed sentiments ranging from optimism to skepticism and humor regarding upcoming games and players' performances.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Stillabucsfan"", ""post"": ""Gotta catch back up with burrow at 27 td\u2019s, Baker is about to go tf off with M1KE coming back"", ""post_time"": [""November"", ""22nd,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""4:34"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Rover"", ""post"": ""Anyone here remember the 2019 Daniel Jones first start/game after the Eli Manning benching??

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/11/malik-nabers-questionable/|Malik Nabers “Questionable”|"There really is only one Giants offensive player the Bucs need to be worried about. And that is Malik Nabers. The rookie receiver is a really special player. And with the Bucs secondary regularly getting lit up like a Roman candle on the Fourth of July, Nabers could do damage even if Chief Illiniwek himself, Tommy Cutlets, is throwing the ball. Well, the Bucs may luck out, to the detriment of Nabers and the Giants. Per NFL insider Jordan Schultz, Nabers did not practice with the Giants today with a groin injury and is questionable for Sunday’s game. Look, Joe doesn’t want to see anyone hurt. And as a football fan, Joe sort of looked forward to watching Nabers. Then again, the Bucs could be without their starting corners, Jamel Dean and Zyon McCollum (though Dean is expected to play, he hasn’t yet been activated). Dean has been practicing and did say he is “ready” earlier this week. It helps if he’s on the active roster.

But I feel better than I did going into the Ravens game, so that’s a good thing.” Evans added of the Ravens game in which he blew out his hamstring on a dropped touchdown pass, “I probably should have sat that one out.” That was Oct. 21. Evans hasn’t played since. He’s expected to play Sunday in New Jersey against the Giants. Evans said it was rough being a spectator. “It hurt seeing your team out there fighting really tough close games that they could have won and I wished I could be out there to help them,” he said. “So, you know, I’m excited to be back.” Joe was pleased to hear Evans say how hard he’s been running the past couple of weeks with teammate Jamel Dean, who also was in hamstring recovery. Dean will start at cornerback Sunday after returning from the injured reserve list. Evans said all that work has given him a lot of confidence. Unfortunately, Joe didn’t hear Evans say, “I’m 100 percent.”|2024-11-22 15:58:00|203|9|6|Mike Evans|Evans excited to return after injury|8|Some optimistic|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Win in the Trenches"", ""post"": ""We need you Mike"", ""post_time"": [""November"", ""22nd,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""3:28"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""JimBobBuc"", ""post"": ""He should get hot wraps on the hammy between series to keep it hot and loose.

The All-Pro tackle sprained his knee in the second quarter against the 49ers. Fortunately, it was just a sprained MCL. So Wirfs was only going to be out a short time. The bye, for Wirfs, came at a perfect time. And while Bowles admitted Wirfs may play — Bowles said earlier Wirfs would be gametime decision — Bowles said today the Bucs have to factor in the big picture when deciding whether to give Wirfs the green light or not Sunday. “We want to be smart and make sure he’s okay for the rest of the way,” Bowles said. “He’s getting a little better day by day. “We’ll see. It’s going to go right up until Sunday for him.” Sadly, the Bucs have painted themselves into a corner. The Bucs likely cannot lose two games the rest of the way if they hope to play meaningful games in January. That’s what happens when you can’t win close games. That’s what happens when your defense can’t close the door. That’s what happens when your defense bends over for your opponents. That’s what happens when half of the Bucs’ six losses came on the final drive of the game. And then there’s the ugly fact Bowles teams, whe he’s head coach, are 1-5 coming off a bye week, 0-2 with Tampa Bay. As for defensive back Tykee Smith, who is the only Bucs player ruled out for Sunday, Bowles suggested that Smith “reaggravated” his knee, which has pushed back his return.|2024-11-22 15:53:00|279|12|5|Todd Bowles|Wirfs' playing uncertain|6|Mixed reactions to player availability and team performance against the Giants without key players.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""PSL Bob"", ""post"": ""Great (sarcasm).

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/11/calls-for-victory-and-desperation/|Calls For Victory And “Desperation”|So which Bucs wide receiver will expose the routinely shaky Giants secondary on Sunday? Well, perhaps none will have to. The Giants rank last in the NFL against the run (5.3 yards per carry allowed) and the Bucs have turned into a punishing running team. Yes, the Giants (2-8) are bad and possibly imploding after a strange quarterback change. The Bucs also are bad at 4-6, but they’re not falling apart and they’ve played a brutal schedule. So NFL pundits, not including other than those lining the streets of Cliffside Park and Jersey City, are unified in their belief that the Bucs will beat the Giants on Sunday. Former Bucs quarterback Chris Simms sees a 27-20 victory for the Bucs. First, Simms isn’t caught up in the hype surrounding Giants No. 3 QB Tommy DeVito getting the start. “To think that he can just jump in here and play really high level football, I gotta see that to believe it,” Simms said on Pro Football Talk. “Now we know this is a Bucs defense that’s not real good. So there might be some plays there to be had.” Simms sounded like he wanted to pick the Bucs in a blowout but couldn’t justify it. “Is there anybody there with the Bucs at wide receiver that can expose [the Giants’ secondary] right now? That’s what I worry about a little bit, as far as dictating [by] how much they win the football game,” Simms said. Former Todd Bowles coaching colleague and Chiefs head coach Todd Haley said on SiriusXM NFL Radio that he likes the Bucs on Sunday for the “desperation” factor. It’s all-or-nothing for the Bucs at this point, he noted, whereas the Giants are in a very different place. Joe and fellow longtime Bucs fans have seen this dance before, a game in which a Bucs team has a lot more on the line — and more talent — than their opponent. It doesn’t always end well, but Joe believes the Bucs walk away winners on Sunday.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/11/liam-coen-receivers-need-to-get-open/|Liam Coen: Receivers Need To Get Open|Joe thought the loss to the 49ers was the first time since Mike Evans and Chris Godwin got hurt that the offense really missed them. It wasn’t so much that the two star receivers weren’t available. Yesterday, offensive coordinator Liam Coen noted that guys not named “Evans” or “Godwin” need to start getting open and get separation. That apparently wasn’t happening against the 49ers and the offense was dragged down. “We need them to be open as much as possible,” Coen said about all his receivers aside from the Big Two. “That’s the one thing that maybe showed up a little bit [against San Francisco], was that we’ve just got to win and the timing and the rhythm” of the passing game.” Coen said he doesn’t want to hear any excuses the Bucs are also down left tackle Tristan Wirfs. Be a professional. Find a way. Get open for Baker Mayfield. “When the ball needs to come out … we need them open [for the] timing and rhythm of the play,” Coen said. “Those are some of the things that did kind of occur in that San Francisco game. When we needed the ball out, maybe we couldn’t truly get it out at times.” Still, Coen added he should have done a better job scheming guys open and finding ways to test the San Francisco defense. “That’s also on us, too, and helping put them in a position to get open and move them around a little bit,” Coen said. Joe guesses whatever the 49ers did defensively, the Giants will to try to duplicate it on Sunday, as will other teams. While the Giants aren’t the 49ers, the Giants have a better pass rush. But the Bucs’ objective remains the same; get receivers open before Big Blue’s pass rush gets to Mayfield.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/11/theyve-got-to-find-some-pass-rush/|“They’ve Got To Find Some Pass Rush”|Tony Dungy is looking, just like many of his fellow Tampa residents are. The Hall of Fame and Buccaneers Ring of Honor head coach joined his NBC colleague Mike Florio for a PFT Live episode this week and said the Bucs have two keys to turning around their season. “They’ve got to find some pass rush,” Dungy implored. Father Dungy also added that Mike Evans needs to return healthy to restore explosiveness (or the threat of it) to the offense. Dungy, like most Bucs fans, believes the Bucs will be in the playoffs with a 10-6 record. On paper, per Dungy, the Bucs (4-6) play six teams with records currently worse than Tampa Bay’s in their final seven games. The Falcons (6-5) have three “loseable games” remaining, to use Dungy’s phrase. Florio, who picked the Bucs to be in the NFC Championship game, put it quite succinctly. “They have to start winning more games or they’re going to run out of games,” he said. Joe’s not counting on a Bucs edge pass rush emerging from the shadows. However, the Bucs will face three highly suspect offensive lines in the next three games against the Giants, Panthers and Raiders. That could/should help. The Bucs rank tied for 8th in the NFL in sacks per game, but like Joe and others, Dungy is seeking more consistency and he values an edge rush like Joe does.|2024-11-22 09:28:00|233|16|6|Tony Dungy|Bucs seek pass rush improvement for playoff push.|5|Mixed sentiments on team performance and coaching decisions.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/11/bullish-on-the-bucs-2/|“Bullish” On The Bucs|So, can the Bucs come close to running the table, going, say, 6-1 the rest of the way and clinch a playoff berth? The way the NFC North is going, Joe isn’t fully sure 10 wins will get the Bucs in the playoffs. Hello, 2010. One guy who thinks the Bucs just may pull this off is Jeremy Fowler of BSPN. The Bucs have a lot of guys still on the team who know what postseason success is all about. That street cred, Fowler believes, should not be dismissed. I’m still bullish on the Buccaneers, whose plans were thwarted by a brutal injury stretch while in the middle of a four-game losing streak (against the likes of the Ravens, Falcons, Chiefs and 49ers). But they played them all tough, and two key players at positions of need — wide receiver Mike Evans and cornerback Jamel Dean — return this week. Tampa Bay can hang with any team offensively, and the schedule is very favorable. Five of their final six opponents are well below .500. Well, the first speed bump is Sunday in the New Jersey Swamplands. Why is Joe worried about a team that some believe has launched a two-year tank scheme in to draft Texas backup quarterback Arch Manning? Simple, history. Bucs coach Todd Bowles is on a five-game losing streak when coming back from a bye. That’s brutal. Just as brutal as the Giants, a team riding a five-game losing streak. And the way the Bucs defense has played, or not played, they’ll keep any team in the game. Before Joe can embrace a playoff push, Joe has to see the Bucs defense play much better.|2024-11-22 09:00:00|278|18|8|Buccaneers|Optimistic about Bucs' playoff chances with improved health and schedule.|2|Mixed sentiments with criticisms towards the defense and coaching staff|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Lt.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/11/stats-prove-bucs-miss-mike-evans-and-chris-godwin/|Stats Prove Bucs Miss Mike Evans And Chris Godwin|“This Joe” really believes Bucs offensive coordinator Liam Coen will be looking for a new home in two months. Not because the Bucs are struggling, but because Coen has done such a good job with the offense. Even though Joe has documented weekly how the offense is dink-and-dunk, it’s working. The Bucs offense is not the problem with this 4-6 team. In the loss to the 49ers, that was the first time it looked like the Bucs finally missed Mike Evans and Chris Godwin, who were both hurt during the loss to the Crows. Against San Francisco, Baker Mayfield barely threw the ball past the line of scrimmage. Well, the stats show the Bucs really did miss Evans and Godwin, types Rich Hriber of Sharp Football Analysis. Over their four-game losing streak, Tampa Bay has averaged 2.3 plays of 20 or more yards per game, 31st in the league. Well, it’s hard to have a play over 20 yards when you rarely throw to a target 20 yards downfield. While Joe was a bit surprised the Bucs are near the bottom of the league in this category without Evans and Godwin, the fact Coen has pulled back the passing offense with those studs out should have been a tipoff. Even an 80 percent Mike Evans would be better than the guys the Bucs trying to turn into a WR1.|2024-11-22 04:45:00|229|12|4|Bucs|Bucs offense struggles without key injured players.|4|Mixed sentiments on team performance and key player absence.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""#99 the Big Fella"", ""post"": ""I don\u2019t think we need any stats to know that..

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/11/struggling-to-find-snaps-for-sean-tucker/|Struggling To Find Snaps For Sean Tucker|Joe guesses the three-headed monster has gone bye-bye. After Bucs second-year running back Sean Tucker lit up the slimy Saints, the Bucs had their public messaging on point in the days following the win. The Bucs were going to give, in theory, each running back a drive to start the game to prove himself. The guy with the hot hand would log the majority of snaps after that. When the Bucs played the 49ers, fans saw that theories and plans are not reality. Or, as Mike Tyson once said, “Everybody has a plan until you get punched in the mouth.” Yesterday, Bucs offensive coordinator Liam Coen confessed it’s hard to find snaps for Tucker, which is why he’s been pretty much buried on the bench. “It’s so hard to be able to say, ‘Ok, this guy on this play,’” Coen said. “Now we’re subbing in and out every play. We haven’t been able to play with any tempo because we’re changing personnel almost every play because we’re trying to put holes in there. “‘Ok, we have to fix this one, we have to move this guy.’ The goal going into this year was to play an ‘11’ personnel and be ready to go. Now we’ve had to kind of go this way and that way to go to ‘12’ and ‘21’, and different variations which is great. “It gets other people involved but it also does make it harder on us to move those pieces around every play and that gets to be, at times, exhausting.” Well, this is not the first time Coen has mentioned a lot of subbing sort of screws up the flow of the offense, the tempo. Joe believes constantly flipping guys in and out just so they can get snaps messes with the offense. So why did the Bucs push the notion (and false hope?) that Tucker would get a chance each game to stay on the field and earn more carries? Could it be that since the Bucs couldn’t more losses the team scrapped plans to, in essence, hold a live running back tryout each game?|2024-11-22 01:00:00|352|17|4|Sean Tucker|Struggles to find playing time for promising running back.|6|A mix of frustration|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Lou."", ""post"": ""Sean is a major asset.
