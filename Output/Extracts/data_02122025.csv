https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/the-easy-expensive-solution/|The Easy, Expensive Solution|BY IRA KAUFMAN Things are about to get very interesting around One Buc Place. There shouldn’t be any debate about Tampa Bay’s most pressing need heading into the 2025 season. The Bucs must find a way to acquire a winning edge because Vita Vea and Calijah Kancey aren’t enough to manufacture a consistent pass rush without help. The Bucs also need to address inside linebacker and cornerback, but it all starts up front and Todd Bowles needs a dynamic edge rusher to shake up an embattled defense that posted only seven interceptions last year while allowing the most completions in the league. Opposing offensive coordinators had a simple approach against the Bucs in 2024: let’s throw, then throw some more. Despite yielding an average of 4.3 yards per carry, the Buc defense faced only 389 runs — the third-fewest carries in the NFL. In stark contrast, opponents put the ball in the air 630 times, second in the league to Minnesota (637). The answer is simple — throwing against the Bucs proved to be very effective. An immobile quarterback like Kirk Cousins shredded the Bucs twice because Tampa Bay’s rush couldn’t place him under duress. YaYa Diaby has a bright future, but his sack total diminished in Year 2 and the Bucs can’t seriously believe Shaq Barrett is the answer to their edge woes. Something has to give, and it could come down to a serious, candid chat between Jason Licht and the people who sign the checks. The easy solution is to throw a lot of money at Josh Sweat in free agency. He had a legitimate claim to be named Super Bowl MVP and he’s in the prime of an accomplished career. The problem is more than half the league is interested in adding a Josh Sweat, giving his agent all the leverage. Sweat’s a cut above any other free-agent edge rusher, so the Bucs would likely have to win a bidding war. Should the Bucs prevail in the Sweat sweepstakes, Licht would be ecstatic. He wouldn’t have to forfeit assets and he could enter the draft with a more open approach. Who says the Bucs are interested in Sweat? I do. How could they not be? He’s considerably better than anybody coming off the edge on the current roster. If you don’t believe it, just ask Bowles. If Sweat signs with another team, the Bucs could try to address their edge issues in the draft. Two problems: rookie pass rushers usually struggle. Just ask Chris Braswell. No. 2, this is not a particularly deep draft for QB hunters. That leaves the trade market, potentially led by Myles Garrett, Trey Hendrickson, Maxx Crosby and Micah Parsons. Those are four difference makers who could ramp up Bowles’ defensive scheme in terms of aggression. One or two of those studs may be available … but at what cost? Licht would rather prep for a colostomy than part with premium draft picks. In this case, we’re talking multiple first-round choices — and maybe more. That’s not Licht’s style. He’d much rather horde picks than give ’em up. That’s understandable because the Bucs have drafted exceedingly well in recent years. But Licht could be prodded by ownership to take a big swing. The Glazers see no reason why the Bucs can’t compete for a championship — if they can materially improve this defense. Licht gets to make the ultimate call, but it’s not easy to push back against the suggestions of your boss. A deal of this magnitude would absolutely place ownership in a key position of influence. After all, this is not giving up a fifth-rounder for Shaq Mason. The simple answer is to land the best pass rusher in free agency and keep your draft capital intact. Josh Sweat, come on down and show Mr. Braswell how it’s done in the big leagues.|2025-02-12 18:31:00|643|29|7|The Easy|Expensive Solution|3|Mixed sentiments about team's performance with concern over development and potential moves.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Badbucs"", ""post"": ""At least Ira isn\u2019t delusional about Myles."", ""post_time"": [""February"", ""12th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""6:50"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Beeej"", ""post"": ""The wheels fell off the bus last year when Dennis got hurt.

MJD, the former Jags star typing for NFL.com, doesn’t believe Bucky is a top-10 NFL running back, but close. MJD wants to see more from Bucky. That’s why he ranked the Bucs as the No. 11 back in the NFL. Rank: 11 Bucky Irving 2024 stats: 17 games | 207 att | 1,122 rush yds | 5.4 ypc | 8 rush TDs | 47 rec | 392 rec yds | 0 rec TDs | 1 fumble lost Of all the players in the top 11, Irving is the one no one saw coming, and outranked by Houston’s Joe Mixon here only because the veteran was more consistent than the rookie from start to finish. The Bucs’ offense ranked fourth in rushing yards and third overall, and the fourth-round pick helped pave the way. He established himself as an above-average back in the second half of the season by recording 834 scrimmage yards in Weeks 12-18, third-most in the league in that span. I was impressed with his physicality when running between the tackles but also his ability to catch passes out of the backfield. Well, Joe thinks Bucky was more than an “above average back” — if you run for 834 yards in seven games when you know the defense is keying on stopping you. That’s a damn good back. Joe thinks MJD does good work for NFL.com, but he seemed to judge Bucky a little too harshly. Joe would take Bucky over Aaron Jones, Joe Mixon, James Cook, Kyren Williams and Jonathan Taylor. That’s right, no typo there. At least the good thing is Bucky was learning the NFL ways as a rookie.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/free-agency-countdown-26-days-quick-fix-eric-kendricks/|Free Agency Countdown: 26 Days — Quick-Fix Eric Kendricks|Joe wants to thank in advance the tens of thousands of Bucs fans that will be here refreshing their browsers like lunatics on March 10, when the curtain opens on 2025 NFL free agency. Hooters opens for carryout at 11 a.m. The free agency siren goes off at noon. That’s when agents can negotiate with teams and reach agreements to sign players, per NFL rules. Josina Anderson and the “sources” crowd will start spitting out big-name signings on social media. Those deals can be made official on Wednesday, March 12. The Tom Brady credit card bill is nearly paid and the Bucs will have cash to spend. They can make more salary cap room by re-crafting current contracts. Tampa Bay needs an inside linebacker whether or not Lavonte David returns. It’s clear that the Todd Bowles defense is complex and heck, some young guys need a year to learn it. Bowles, frankly, may not have that kind of time to improve his defense. His job could be on the line if the defense isn’t better next season. Enter Eric Kendricks. The former All-Pro turns 33 this month and just finished a heck of a bounce-back season for the Cowboys — 2 interceptions, 3 forced fumbles, 3 sacks and 138 combined tackles in 15 games. The Cowboys got way more than their money’s worth as Kendricks played on a one-year deal for $3 million. Kendricks may want to stay in Dallas, but Joe always hears that players love to play for Todd Bowles, and the Bucs’ defensive pieces should be very enticing to Kendricks. How much of a raise could he command? It smells to Joe like Kendricks would be affordable. Joe could see the Bucs signing a guy like Kendricks and drafting an inside linebaker in Round 3.|2025-02-12 08:53:00|298|35|5|Eric Kendricks|Free agency speculation for Tampa Bay Buccaneers linebackers.|3|Mixed sentiments about age, injuries, player acquisitions, and salary cap considerations in team discussions.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Lt.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/a-jaelon-darden-lesson-from-mike-evans/|A Jaelon Darden Lesson From Mike Evans|Is there something to be learned by standout Bucs receiver Jalen McMillan from Mike Evans’ surprising comments? Perhaps. Joe was intrigued to hear Evans say twice yesterday that Jaelon Darden, the Bucs’ 2021 fourth-round pick, was an exceptional precision route runner, polished and ready for the NFL out of the University of North Texas. Evans almost seemed in awe of Darden’s “crispy” routes as he talked to the Loose Cannons podcast. Evans added that Darden was the most talented receiver he played with that has yet to achieve much NFL success. Darden was the Browns’ returner last season but was waived in December and claimed by Seattle. He’s still on the Seahawks roster. Evans thinks Darden being stuck behind the Bucs’ great targets in the 2021 limited his ability to shine and develop. The Bucs cut him late in the 2022 season. McMillan, the Bucs’ surging rookie last season, is in the class of Darden as a route runner, Evans said. Young players must step up when they have opportunities and Evans said McMillan was a shining example after Chris Godwin was lost to injury last season. After his own injury, McMillan exploded in the final five weeks of the regular season. Joe hopes McMillan can continue to thrive with Godwin healthy and playing next season. (Yes, Joe expects Godwin to return.) Not every player can maintain a high level of play when his role diminishes. Joe’s not saying McMillan will ride the bench and No. 3 receivers don’t catch balls, but change can affect players. McMillan certainly was talented but very streaky as a rookie.|2025-02-12 08:24:00|266|20|8|Jaelon Darden|Evans praises Darden's skills and addresses young players' potential.|4|Mixed opinions on McMillan and Darden, concerns over player abilities and team strategy.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""BuckyBuc"", ""post"": ""McMillan is a smooth operator.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/plenty-of-edge-rushers-to-choose-from-currently/|Plenty Of Edge Rushers To Choose From|You know it. Joe knows it. The trick is, do the Bucs know it? Joe firmly, truly, honestly, passionately believes the Bucs are a consistent edge rusher from having a dominant pass rush, which would fuel the team to make a run at the Super Bowl. Fans want one, so do other members of the media. If you don’t know that Joe wants one, then you haven’t read this here corner of the interwebs in years. What Joe doesn’t know is if the Bucs want one enough to make a deal. By Joe’s count, there are seven productive edge rushers either linked to trade rumors or who will be free agents (if they are not re-signed) in exactly four weeks — when the free agency dinner bell rings following two days of legal tampering and two weeks of illegal tampering beginning in earnest at the combine at the end of the month. Myles Garrett, Trey Hendrickson, DeMarcus Lawrence, Khalil Mack, Micah Parsons, Haason Reddick and Josh Sweat all have had double-digit sacks to their names in recent years and may become available: And that’s not counting any other edge rusher who a team may have on the trade block. By adding a legit, consistent edge rusher, my goodness, how much better would that guy help make Calijah Kancey, Vita Vea and YaYa Diaby? In the coming weeks, maybe only three of those guys will be available Doesn’t mean the Bucs should hide in the corner and cry. Just means they need to be even more aggressive. Joe has a confession.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/it-was-a-repeat-of-tampa/|“It Was A Repeat Of Tampa”|Joe’s Super Bowl beer was still cold Sunday night when Joe typed that what the Eagles did to the Chiefs was a carbon copy of how the Bucs beat the Chiefs to win the Super Bowl four years ago. The Bucs that night used a ferocious pass rush, with Bucs sacks king Shaq Barrett and Jason Pierre Paul chasing Pat Mahomes around like a couple of beagles after a rabbit in the backyard. And occasionally the Bucs caught that rabbit, as the Bucs pounded the Chiefs for their second Super Bowl title. Speaking on “Up and Adams” Tuesday morning hosted by Kay Adams, NBC analyst and PFF Tribe owner Cris Collinsworth read Joe’s mind. He said the Eagles used the blueprint the Bucs devised — and so many other Super Bowl champs used — to smother an otherwise unstoppable offense. How? Edge rush! “It was a repeat of Tampa,” Collinsworth said of the Bucs beating the Chiefs in the Super Bowl. “I mean, it just was. So the formula is now known, right? “And anybody that can do it, it’s the same way the Giants feed Tom Brady back in the Super Bowl with a four-man rush that could get legitimate quick pressure and play seven people in coverage. “I think it’s the only way you can beat a great quarterback, because if you have to blitz to try to go get them all of a sudden, what do you got? You really can’t do that.” It wasn’t just the Eagles and Giants that used a pass rush to beat a great quarterback to win a Super Bowl. Behind Simeon Rice and Warren Sapp, the Bucs beat the snot out of 2002 NFL MVP Raiders QB Rich Gannon to destroy the Raiders as the Bucs won their first Super Bowl. Today, the Bucs have the defensive line capable of repeating what they did in 2020, Joe believes, and what the Eagles did on Sunday night. Except, the Bucs don’t have an edge rusher. There should be no higher priority for the Bucs than to get an edge rusher in free agency next month. To not do so would be criminal. The Bucs are so close to making a Super Bowl run. The window is open if they only had an edge rusher.  |2025-02-12 03:45:00|382|30|8|Joe|Eagles replicate Bucs' Super Bowl win formula with edge rush.|4|Various concerns expressed about the defense, calling for improvements in talent and strategic approach.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Xristos"", ""post"": ""Exactly.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/can-a-cfl-punter-handle-nfl-duties/|Can A CFL Punter Handle NFL Duties?|Yesterday, Joe wrote about the Bucs’ punting situation. Yes, it’s February. Joe wondered how seriously the Bucs were taking the punting position. Since the Bucs released former fourth-round draft pick Jake Camarda, the punting of the Bucs has been frightening. The punting almost reminded Joe of Bucs’ kickers in the last decade, when it seemed the Bucs signed a new kicker every three or four weeks because they couldn’t find one that knew how to kick (reliably). Could a CFL record-holder be the answer? The Bucs signed Jake Julien to a futures contract in January. Punting for the Edmonton Elks — ELKS??? What the hell happened to the Eskimos??? — Julien averaged 54 yards a punt. Generally, guys signed to a futures contract are camp meat for the next training camp.
