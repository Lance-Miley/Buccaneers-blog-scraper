https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/byron-leftwich-finds-work/|Byron Leftwich Finds Work|The man behind one of the worst Bucs offenses that Joe has seen since Stewart McClown quarterbacked team, Byron Leftwich, has finally found a job in football. Per NFL insider Jordan Schultz of FOX Sports, Leftwich was hired by University of Colorado coach Deion Sanders today. Multiple reports including Schultz’s do not specify what Leftwich’s responsibilities will be, only that he has been added to Sanders’ staff in Boulder. Given control of the Bucs offense in 2022 after Super Bowl-winning coach Bucco Bruce Arians resigned, the offense became a trainwreck, even with Tom Brady behind center. Perhaps the worst gameplan Joe has ever seen in person was when the Bucs played at Pittsburgh facing the Steelers’ vaunted run defense. Pittsburgh had so many injuries in their secondary they were pulling guys off Forbes Avenue to play. Armed with Mike Evans and Chris Godwin, what did Leftwich do? He decided to ground and pound and maybe throw some dink-and-dunk passes. What made this travesty even more unnerving was that the referees working the game had a high tendency for throwing defensive pass interference flags. Yet with stud receivers going against practice squad dudes, Leftwich thought it was smarter to have Rachaad White run at Cam Heyward. Brilliant! On top of that, Leftwich, always full of confidence, became arrogant and condescending, talking down to reporters who had the gall to question his genius. Whenever he was asked about using receivers in motion, for example, he scoffed and referred to that as “fantasy football.” Yet Bucs fans saw with their own eyes what motion did for the Bucs offense with largely the same personnel sans Brady the next two seasons. After Leftwich was launched in early 2023, he tried to get several jobs, both NFL and college, even reaching out to Notre Dame coach Marcus Freeman for an offensive coordinator job. Instead, Freeman promoted Fighting Irish tight ends coach Gerad Parker over Leftwich. Parker now coaches Troy. Leftwich’s efforts to join Mike Tomlin’s staff in Pittsburgh were unrequited. So for the first time in over two years, Leftwich has found a job in football.|2025-03-19 17:25:00|351|54|1|Byron Leftwich|Leftwich hired by University of Colorado coach Deion Sanders.|2|Mixed reactions towards Byron Leftwich, reflecting skepticism, support, and criticism.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Bojim"", ""post"": ""Equipment manager."", ""post_time"": [""March"", ""19th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""5:30"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""EEK"", ""post"": ""reclamation project "", ""post_time"": [""March"", ""19th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""5:46"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""KABucs"", ""post"": ""Waterboy"", ""post_time"": [""March"", ""19th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""5:46"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter3"": {""username"": ""KABucs"", ""post"": ""Byron Boucher"", ""post_time"": [""March"", ""19th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""5:48"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter4"": {""username"": ""Tbbucs3"", ""post"": ""Good!

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/bucs-locker-room-vibe-lures-back-sterling-shepard/|Bucs Locker Room Vibe Lures Back Sterling Shepard|Joe thought wide receiver Sterling Shepard was a nice signing last year. Yeah, he may have made a few too many dumb mistakes that didn’t sit well with Joe. But it’s nice to have a competent veteran off the bench. One reason Shepard originally signed with the Bucs is that he’s tight with Baker Mayfield, his former college quarterback at Oklahoma. But Shepard is returning for another year for more reasons than just Mayfield. In short, Shepard said he liked the vibe of the locker room and the receivers room had a nice blend of top-shelf veterans and talented youngsters. Besides, Shepard added, the locker room may have been better than he expected. “Being a part of it last year, it was very encouraging to me, which is ultimately the reason I decided to come back just because of knowing the system and being in this system before,” Shepard said. “It’s not like a major change because ‘Grizz’ (offensive coordinator Josh Grizzard) is in that spot now. “In my nine years in the NFL, I’ve been a part of a lot of groups and not one has been as close as the guys we’ve had in this locker room, especially in the wide receiver room. You’ve got veteran guys in there and then you’ve got a good balance of younger guys, as well, so we’re able to speak life into those guys and help them in any way that they need. … “It’s a special combination. Like I said, I’m just super excited to be back as a part of this crew, and this group of guys, because I feel like we have something special coming, and we’ve just got to put it all the way together.” Joe believes the Bucs could be special, too. The offense ought to still be good and maybe be even better than last year’s No. 3 offense because the three rookie starters now have over a dozen games under their belts. Joe hates to put additional pressure on new offensive coordinator Josh Grizzard, but all he has to do is not screw things up. Shoot, if he keeps the Bucs offense humming, he too may be a head coach somewhere in January. With the addition of Haason Reddick and surely a starter or two in the draft, Joe sees no reason why the Bucs cannot do damage in January.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/new-buccaneer-takes-a-shot-at-his-pff-grade/|New Buccaneer Takes A Shot At “His PFF Grade”|Joe’s no fan of the Pro Football Focus player grades, though they’re symbolic of one of the great pay-per-read hoaxes of the modern era. Another guy who isn’t a fan is new Bucs inside linebacker Anthony Walker, Jr. The Bucs signed the eight-year veteran inside linebacker in free agency last week and he took a shot at PFF today during his introductory Bucs news conference in Tampa. It seems there has been criticism — bad grades? — of his pass coverage, but Walker says don’t believe it. “I see all the stuff on social media and everything where people be like, ‘Oh, his PFF grade,’ and all that. I’m here to tell you can watch the film,” Walker said. “The ball does not get completed behind me or in front of me in the middle of the field.” Joe stood and applauded, and not just because the Bucs fans are desperate to heal the trauma of a season filled with watching inside linebackers K.J. Britt and J.J. Russell in pass coverage. It was great hearing a respected player figuratively urinating upon the PFF Tribe for its grades. Keep in mind Walker was the Browns’ Walter Payton Man of the Year nominee in 2023, and an alumnus of Northwestern. He’s no clown. To make his PFF jab even more fun, Walker described himself today as a student of the game, a former high school defensive back and receiver whose father was his high school coach.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/anthony-walker-says-he-was-handpicked-by-lavonte-david/|Anthony Walker Says He Was Handpicked By Lavonte David|Very interesting chatter between new Bucs linebacker Anthony Walker, Joe and Zoom-assembled Tampa Bay media this afternoon.  Joe kicked off the action asking Walker to explain his relationship with Lavonte David, who noted Monday that he knows how hard Walker works and knows him well. Joe did not expect the response that the veteran Walker delivered. Anthony Walker, Jr.: I know Lavonte pretty much most of my life. Being from Miami, actually one of his close friends, I played football with his little brother. So I was just always around. Once I made the NFL, they kind of let me get into the group, the older group, to hang with the cool kids, I guess. Yeah, we’ve trained together every offseason since like my third year in the NFL. You know, obviously a mentor of mine, a guy that I’ve learned from, tried to model my game after and just a very good friend of mine. JoeBucsFan.com: Do you feel like he’s part of the reason that you’re here? Maybe that connection or speaking up for you? Walker:  (laughs) Yeah, a huge reason. Obviously, the respect that he has in Tampa, on this team, in the city, you know, everywhere he’s been he’s touched a lot of lives. And for him to help me get here is amazing, as well. Obviously a chance to be teammates would be pretty dope. And I’ve kept telling him that. He’s said one day he was going to make it happen. We’ve been trying to get this done since I was getting drafted [in 2017] but, you know, finally able to get it done. Walker has made 83 starts in his eight seasons covering time with the Colts, Browns and Dolphins, including eight starts in 14 games played for Miami last season. There’s very interesting depth brewing in the Bucs’ linebacker corps. Joe said interesting, not “good.” That’s to be determined — if SirVocea Dennis can stay on the field and Walker, who turns 30 in August, hasn’t lost a step. Man, if the Bucs’ draft an inside linebacker with a premium pick next month, all of a sudden they’ll be loaded at the position.|2025-03-19 14:32:00|361|22|9|Anthony Walker|Lavonte David connection sparks positivity in Bucs' linebacker corps.|3|Mixed sentiment with some optimism but mostly concerns and doubts about draft choices and injuries.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""RVATom"", ""post"": ""Cool insight.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/lavonte-david-messages-come-from-the-top/|Lavonte David: Messages Come From The Top|So who first told Haason Reddick the most important thing he likely wanted to hear from the Bucs outside of his salary? It’s not Lavonte David, he told WDAE radio this week. As of Monday, David said he hadn’t yet spoken to his new beastly edge rusher teammate. David was asked whether he will advise Reddick how the locker room operates in Tampa and that he has a completely clean slate with his new team. David said he will share that with Reddick but it’s secondary because it’s taken care of at the highest levels of One Buc Palace. “I’m sure he probably got that energy when he first walked in the building. You know, it don’t start from us [players] it starts from the top down,” David said. “So definitely, I’m sure he got that energy. But the players to reiterate that to him, I’m sure he’ll get it. I know those guys [in the Bucs hierarchy] bring in people who are trying to buy in to what we’re trying to do as an organization. So I’m sure he’ll get the picture.” Joe was very surprised to hear David hadn’t talked to Reddick yet. Odd. Often players are asking for contact information of new teammates so they can extend a warm welcome, especially an established player. David added that new Bucs love the locker room culture when they arrive and he’s sure Reddick will be a great addition for younger outside linebackers.  You can listen to WDAE live right here.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/a-top-ten-team/|A Top-Ten Team|Joe isn’t sure if this is a good thing or a sign of an apocalyptical collapse in 2025. Joe will take the good here. So let it be written. So let it be said: The PFF Tribe has knighted the Bucs as the NFL’s 10th-best team in mid-March. That’s the analysis by Mason Cameron. This piece was published on St. Patrick’s Day, so Joe isn’t sure if Cameron may have had a wee bit too much of the drink from the old sod as he typed this piece. … Losing offensive coordinator Liam Coen is a blow to a Bucs offense that ranked fifth in EPA per play last season, but retaining Chris Godwin ensures this unit will have the pieces to remain competitive in 2025. Baker Mayfield’s resurgence, combined with the reliable duo of Chris Godwin and Mike Evans and the addition of Bucky Irving in the backfield, keeps this offense in a strong position. Tampa didn’t make a splash in free agency, but the team did land Haason Reddick on a prove-it deal to strengthen the pass rush. With low risk for the Bucs and plenty of upside for Reddick, this move has the potential to pay off for both sides. Joe cannot disagree with anything Cameron typed other than the signing of Reddick very much was a splash if not a total shock to the system. But Cameron overlooked two key signings. First, Lavonte David came back. The second-best linebacker the Bucs have ever had (yes, Joe would put him above Hardy Nickerson), David retiring would have put his defense in a world of hurt. If David retired, who would the Bucs have at inside linebacker? Injury-prone SirVocea Dennis and who? The second signing, though under the radar, is Ben Bredeson. Now Joe’s not saying this guy is John Hannah or even Charley Hannah. But Bredeson’s return keeps a strong, young Bucs offensive line intact. That’s no small thing. If the Bucs are able to find a quality inside linebacker, Joe truly believes this Bucs team can do damage in January.|2025-03-19 10:30:00|344|23|6|Buccaneers|Positive analysis of Bucs' potential in NFL for 2025.|7|Mixed sentiment with some optimism, critique, and uncertainty expressed by commenters.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""garro"", ""post"": ""Joe if LVD had retired Jason would have had to go and spend some money?

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/e-j-speed-and-the-bucs-part-ii/|E.J. Speed And The Bucs (Part II)|So a very productive inside linebacker Joe wrote about as a possibility for the Bucs remains on the free agent market.  The Bucs need inside linebacker help and 29-year-old E.J. Speed has very low mileage on his body and a lot of tackles on his resume. That includes 142 combined tackles for the Colts last season and 102 in 2023, his first year as a starter. The six-year veteran barely played on defense in his first four seasons when he was known as one of the NFL’s best special teams players. Joe sees Speed as a guy who could play effectively alongside Lavonte David. He’s used to playing with NFL tackles leader and Pro Bowler Zaire Franklin. Speed, a 2019 fifth-round pick out of the Division II ranks certainly can do it all but he is known for missing tackles. The data nerds say he’s the worst in the NFL in missed tackle percentage, but he also had 142 tackles last season, so that’s a unique reality. Joe can’t see Speed commanding a ton of money after completing a two-year, $8 million deal and not finding a bunch of takers in free agency. He seems ripe for a one-year deal for a few million plus incentives. The Colts have a new defensive coordinator, so Joe can’t fault Speed for being unwanted. Perhaps Speed is a guy Todd Bowles feels he can get more out of? Joe continues to wonder if Speed’s podcast with Franklin is an issue. It’s R-rated and has been controversial, though it’s primarily Franklin drawing the headlines. Would Speed agree to kill the podcast for a job with a Super Bowl contender in Tampa.|2025-03-19 09:51:00|277|17|7|E.J. Speed|Inside linebacker E.J.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/gregg-rosenthal-haason-reddick-was-a-better-signing-than-joey-bosa/|Gregg Rosenthal: Haason Reddick Was A Better Signing Than Joey Bosa|A couple of folks who regularly do deep dives on the NFL seem to agree when it comes to the Bucs landing a big fish in the free agency pond last week. Appearing on Mina Kimes’ podcast, Gregg Rosenthal of NFL.com and Kimes discussed edge rushers signed last week, and both are not on board with the Bills shelling out cash to talented but injury-prone Joey Bosa. Rosenthal stopped just short of saying Bosa is washed because when he did get on the field for the Chargers last year, he was just a part-time player and often played hurt. Rosenthal thought the Bills would have been better off copying Bucs AC/DC-loving general manager Jason Licht. “I think [Haason] Reddick was a much better guy to take a shot with on a one-year deal than Bosa.” Kimes was on board. “I actually like that a lot for the Bucs, too,” Kimes said. “I agree, one year, only $12 [million] guaranteed. Clearly, last year was weird and off [for Reddick], you know? The whole time. “So I think betting on his potential, I think if he’s anywhere close to what he was before last year, that’s going to be a home run signing for them.” Absolutely it will be a home run signing for the Bucs if Reddick gets, say, 12 sacks. Joe truly believes that if Reddick has his normal year, he will elevate everyone on the Bucs’ defensive line. Joe knows some are uneasy about who will play safety next to Antoine Winfield and some want the Bucs to move on from Jamel Dean (that doesn’t look likely right now). A fierce pass rush is the best medicine for a secondary with question marks.|2025-03-19 07:00:00|284|17|5|Haason Reddick|Rosenthal and Kimes prefer Reddick over Bosa for Bucs' defense.|7|Mixed sentiment on pass rushers and secondary with optimism but also concerns about depth.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""geno711"", ""post"": ""Joey Bosa looked no more washed than Jordan Whitehead\u2026."", ""post_time"": [""March"", ""19th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""7:12"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""buc4evr"", ""post"": ""Agree on Bosa, but still would like another decent veteran Edge rusher in the rotation.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/cbs-bucs-badly-need-an-inside-linebacker/|CBS: Bucs Badly Need An Inside Linebacker|So the way Joe looks at it, two primary Bucs draft needs are inside linebacker and corner. Secondary needs? Receiver, safety and running back. Let Joe explain: The Bucs’ two best receivers are 32 and 29 and the younger guy has had two major injuries to his wheels including a dislocated ankle that’s still healing. Running back? Joe loves the current running backs but what are the odds Rachaad White signs a second contract with the Bucs? And next year Sean Tucker will be in his contract year. But yeah, inside linebacker is the biggest hole on the roster. And it seems the son of a former NFL punter agrees. John Breech of CBS went through every team in the NFL looking at their post-free agency biggest need. Breech thinks the Bucs need to draft an inside linebacker at No. 19. Safety and linebacker are probably two of the biggest needs if you are a believer that Cade Otton can be a solution for them at tight end. They re-signed Lavonte David but, at some point, he is going to move on and there is not a transition of power in waiting. Joe is a believer in Cade Otton. He showed Joe a lot last year when both Mike Evans and Chris Godwin went down with injuries. Otton damn near carried the passing game. Otton has improved each year. What more do you want from a player who finds a way to improve each season? After his play last year, Joe thinks, at worst, Otton is an average starting tight end. The way Todd Bowles spoke about Tykee Smith at the combine, it appears he will have the inside track to fill the hole left by Jordan Whitehead’s exit. So in Joe’s mind, inside linebacker is the hole the Bucs need to fill next month in the draft. And Joe still has a thing for Alabama linebacker Jihaad Campbell.|2025-03-19 03:45:00|319|24|5|Bucs|Draft needs: inside linebacker crucial|4|Mixed sentiment with some optimism but concerns about draft strategy and player performance.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Buc king"", ""post"": ""In August 2024, Hill and the Miami Dolphins agreed to a new three-year, $90 million contract extension, with $65 million guaranteed.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/re-signing-bryce-hall-signals-draft-tell/|Re-Signing Bryce Hall Signals Draft Tell|As Joe has written a few times, what a team does in free agency is often a road map to how it will draft in April. The Bucs already signed edge rusher Haason Reddick. Also, early in free agency, the Bucs re-signed franchise stars Chris Godwin and Lavonte David. Yesterday, it was learned the Bucs brought back their No. 3 corner to start the 2024 season, Bryce Hall. (Hall blew out a wheel in Week 1 and was lost for the season.) So it appears the Bucs will not address starting corner or a top-shelf backup corner in free agency. So that tells Joe a cornerback is coming in the draft. There is still a major need for another inside linebacker. Joe knows the Bucs said all the right things about SirVocea Dennis but until he proves he can stay on the field, he is a major question mark. Joe thinks the Bucs in the first two days of the draft will yield a new inside linebacker and a new cornerback. Whether those guys are drafted in the first, second or third rounds, feel free to guess.|2025-03-19 00:00:00|187|31|6|Bryce Hall|Bucs draft strategy based on re-signings.|5|Mixed sentiments on draft priorities, with optimism for Bucs' strategic approach.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Chris"", ""post"": ""I sure hope so Joe we\u2019ve neglected the LB position way too much , like you\u2019ve said before also We\u2019re darn lucky to have David back.

Even through it is against lesser competition his elite processing and read/react talents are undeniable and he had a pair of one-hand INTs that demonstrate his WR-like ball skills.  His Cal film from 2024 is rock solid too.  It shows his ability to be an asset against the run and his natural instincts as a blitzer (33% pressure rate!)  He isn\u2019t a track star and is undersized but plays within himself and lets his exceptional awareness and processing make up it.  He is not LVD Jr.  He is the ILB that this roster needs now and he has the vision and range to close the abyss in the middle of the Bucs third down defense.

I\u2019m actually excited to have ball hawking Deion Jones as a contributor but Buchanan can contribute as a 3rd down specialist from day one.
