https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/win-and-in/|Win And In|There is joy in the streets of central Florida, from Venice to Crystal River all the way to Cocoa Beach. That’s because the Commandos beat the Dixie Chicks tonight. The Bucs, as a result, are back in first place! The Commandos had to go to overtime to win, 30-24. So it is real simple this coming Sunday for the Bucs: Win and they’re in. Lose and, well, Joe doesn’t want to think about that. If the Bucs beat the slimy Saints at home, the Bucs win the NFC South and will host a wild card round playoff game in two weeks. No need to fret or wring your hands or concern yourself with anything else. It’s as simple as can be: Win Sunday, and the Bucs are in the playoffs. Should be fun. Thank you Dan Quinn and Jayden Daniels.|2024-12-29 23:44:00|140|64|8|Bucs|Bucs have a chance to make playoffs with win.|3|Mixed sentiments with some optimism but mostly pessimism and frustration towards coaching decisions.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""adam from ny"", ""post"": ""wow i sweated out that game like a fat man in a sauna"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""29th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""11:45"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Kayla"", ""post"": ""The Bucs are lucky ducks today!"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""29th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""11:46"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""Chrisonthecape"", ""post"": ""Could Bowles possibly screw this up?"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""29th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""11:47"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter3"": {""username"": ""Saskbucs"", ""post"": ""Beautiful.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/todd-bowles-doesnt-want-to-hear-about-wins/|Todd Bowles Doesn’t Want To Hear About Wins|Right now with the playoffs on the line, Todd Bowles isn’t worried about records or wins. Right now Bowles is only worried about two specific wins: The Commandos tonight and the Bucs next Sunday. If the Bucs win next week, Bowles and the Bucs will finish the regular season with 10 wins. That would be Bowles’ best regular season with the Bucs. And no matter how much some fans may detest Bowles, it’s awfully hard to make a coaching change when a coach has double-digit wins and it’s the most he’s had in his Bucs tenure. Bowles had no interest discussing his potential 10-win season after today’s blowout of the Panthers. “No, we’re just trying to get to the playoffs,” Bowles said. “If we can win next week and get a little help, that will mean a lot to me.” But wins and his record? That means nothing to Bowles. Right now, it’s all about the playoffs.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/ira-kaufmans-10-takeaways-from-bucs-panthers-9/|Ira Kaufman’s 10 Takeaways From Bucs-Panthers|BY IRA KAUFMAN That’s the way you handle your business. To give themselves a chance at a fourth consecutive NFC South title, the Bucs had to do their own part by beating the Panthers. They stomped Carolina, handing former offensive coordinator Dave Canales a stinging 48-14 setback, matching the franchise record for most points scored in a home game. It was a complete performance led by Baker Mayfield and an unstoppable offense that rolled up 33 first downs and 551 yards. Rookies Bucky Irving and Jalen McMillan took turns tormenting the visitors while Mike Evans caught a pair of short TD passes and closed in on another 1,000-yard season. Todd Bowles wasn’t happy with Adam Thielen’s 40-yard scoring reception that gave Carolina some hope in the final minute of the opening half, but Tampa Bay regrouped and blanked the Panthers 21-0 in the last two quarters. Payne Durham joined the fun with his first NFL TD catch and J.J. Russell dashed 23 yards for a score with a punt that was blocked by Joe Tryon-Shoyinka. Mayfield was spectacular, throwing five scoring passes and only five incompletions. He spread the wealth to nine different targets and Evans is now only 85 yards away from the 1,000-yard mark. McMillan has emerged as a serious threat with six TD catches in the last four weeks.  At 9-7, the Bucs are now guaranteed another winning season under Bowles, who has bigger accomplishments in mind. The rain held off until an hour after the game but Carolina’s defense, missing standout cornerback Jaycee Horn, was left high and dry as Tampa Bay converted 10-of-14 on third down and didn’t turn the ball over. Not even a wayward duck wandering the field could slow Tampa Bay’s momentum. Irving, now established as the No. 1 ball carrier, accounted for 190 yards from scrimmage, leaving a slew of would-be tacklers in his wake. The Bucs gained 337 yards in the first half alone, scoring once again on their opening possession. Mayfield’s protection was stout and the offensive line carved out massive holes in a 202-yard ground game. Bryce Young was sacked five times and Carolina’s run game went nowhere, averaging 3.0 yards. The only bright spot for the Panthers was Thielen, a crafty veteran who caught five passes for 110 yards and two scores. Here’s how the Bucs rewarded their fans with a dominating victory, giving them a 5-1 mark since the bye week and rebounding forcefully from the bitter loss at Dallas: * What a draft class for Jason Licht and his scouting staff. Irving, McMillan, Graham Barton and Tykee Smith have made significant contributions as rookies. The light has turned on for McMillan, who had only one TD catch in his first eight games. He has five receptions in each of his last three games and Liam Coen is doing a stellar scheme job, freeing McMillan up in space. * Tampa Bay’s rush defense is peaking at the right time. While the Buc run game is flourishing, opponents have been held under 100 yards on the ground for seven consecutive games. It helped Sunday when 1,195-yard rusher Chuba Hubbard was declared inactive with a calf strain. * Somebody needs to remind Trey Palmer that you don’t field a punt inside your 10-yard line. His questionable judgment could cost the Bucs a game. * Mayfield was at the top of his game from the start, making smart reads and getting everyone involved. With 39 TD passes on the season, Mayfield needs five against the Saints in Week 18 to top Tom Brady’s single-season franchise mark set in 2021. * You want big plays? Five of Tampa Bay’s 74 snaps gained at least 26 yards. * The Bucs have scored at least 30 points in half of their 16 games this season. That’s why Liam Coen will likely be the first name on my ballot next week when selecting the NFL’s Assistant Coach of the Year. * Evans surely wants to keep that 1,000-yard streak alive, but Mayfield REALLY wants to keep it going. Look for No. 13 to be targeted heavily in the early stages of Sunday’s matchup. “I’m looking forward to seeing what happens next week,” Mayfield said. * Speaking of 1,000 yards, Irving now has 1,033 yards on the ground. More importantly, he’s averaging a stunning 5.5 yards per carry. He seems to bust a big run every week and the Saints defense better hustle to the ball or Irving will wreck the game plan. * It takes a lot for Bowles to pull Mayfield from a game, but the time was right midway through the fourth quarter and the Bucs ahead by 34 points. Kyle Trask didn’t get to attempt a pass, but Mayfield avoided any chance of a late-game injury. Smart move. * Bowles has a chance to go 10-7 in his third season on the Tampa Bay sidelines. Given the array of injuries the Bucs have suffered and the 4-6 start, that would be no small achievement.   |2024-12-29 19:00:00|834|24|6|Ira Kaufman|Bucs dominate Panthers in a decisive victory.|4|Mixed opinions on Bowles, highlighting defensive struggles, some support for his leadership.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Zzbucs"", ""post"": ""Ira, your last paragraph was spot on\u2026\u2026.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/jalen-mcmillan-is-on-fire/|Jalen McMillan Is On Fire|Right when many rookies have hit the infamous rookie wall or even succumbed to it (even Bucky Irving admitted he’s struggling with the wall), wide receiver Jalen McMillan is beating the rookie wall like the East Germans did to the Berlin Wall late last century. McMillan is on fire. He now has six touchdowns in his last four games, including two today against the Stinking Panthers. On one touchdown, he came across the middle from right to left and was wide ass open. Joe asked McMillan, who has blown up since Mike Evans has become fully healthy, if his success is as simple as defenses are keying too much on Evans and he’s taking advantage. He didn’t exactly deny that. “Yeah, they played certain coverages that just I popped on,” McMillan told Joe. There was one difference, McMillan told Joe. Last week in practices it was drilled down to McMillan that he must be ready for a pass at any moment anywhere on the field. McMillan took those instructions to the turf of The Licht House and the directive worked like a charm. It’s the third game in a row that McMillan has caught five passes. That’s a career-high for him. Like Tristan Wirfs told Joe, McMillan admitted the offense was mentally dialed in today. “We just attacked practice really well,” McMillan said. “We were really detail-sound.” Joe hopes it is like that every week from here on out, however long that may be.|2024-12-29 18:16:00|244|24|9|Jalen McMillan|McMillan shines|7|Positive comments about J-Mac, coaching, O-line, future potential, some concerns about Godwin.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""GoneGator"", ""post"": ""I told you guys.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/todd-bowles-bucs-defensive-backs-removed-heads-from-buttocks/|Todd Bowles: Bucs Defensive Backs Removed Heads From Buttocks|So halftime social media buzz got a shot of juice today when Todd Bowles told the Buccaneers Radio Network that defensive backs needed to get their heads out of their collective asses. It was a flashback to the soundbite era of Bucco Bruce Arians. The soft Bucs zone defense was extra fluffy in the first half, so Bowles wasn’t off the mark. He was asked about the comment after the game. Bowles cracked a grin, laughed and noted that his halftime take was “kind of self-explanatory. I don’t know what to say after that.” That comment “kind of takes care of itself,” Bowles added. “We had that discussion and they got it out [of their asses].” What no doubt infuriated Bowles was old man Panthers receiver Adam Thielen getting behind his defense, specifically Tykee Smith and Jordan Whitehead with 50 seconds remaining in the first half. (Video below) But that was it for the Panthers’ scoring. The defense closed out the game like champs. |2024-12-29 18:02:00|164|24|7|Todd Bowles|Bowles motivates Bucs defense during halftime for successful game.|6|Mixed sentiment with some criticism and some optimism.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""NJbucs23"", ""post"": ""Jamal Dean is the captain of cover no one in the zone scheme."", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""29th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""6:07"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Hydra"", ""post"": ""He is the best pro coach Baker has had by far, the defense had a ton of injuries this year and they still have a chance to make the playoffs"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""29th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""6:12"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""Citrus County"", ""post"": ""Listening to the game on radio I was surprised to hear Bowles say that.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/bucky-hits-1000-yards/|Bucky Hits 1,000 Yards|Today, running back Bucky Irving made a little Bucs history. Irving became the first Bucs’ rookie running back since Doug Martin in 2012 to hit the 1,000-yard rushing mark. And Irving still has another game to rack up yards. Irving finished the afternoon with 113 yards on the ground and 77 through the air. That’s 190 yards of offense from the Oregon product. He touched the ball 24 times — 20 rushes and four catches. Joe remarked to the Sage of Tampa Bay sports, Ira Kaufman, that Bucky would be sore Monday morning. The Bucs needed him today and head coach Todd Bowles pretty much agreed. “Yeah, we knew that we were going to start him starting this ballgame,” Bowles said after the game. “He knew it and everyone else knew it. “So we thought we would try to get him off to a fast start and let him go and he did a good job for us.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/big-day-for-bucs-tight-ends-front-office/|Big Day For Bucs’ Tight Ends, Front Office|So Bucs backup tight ends Devin Culp and Payne Durham combined for 5 catches for 88 yards and a touchdown. And the grabs didn’t even come in garbage time of the 48-14 win. Whaat? Culp hadn’t caught a ball all season and Durham had two targets all season before he jumped into the No. 1 role last week after Cade Otton got hurt. Joe is impressed. These dudes have good hands. Culp, a rookie seventh-round pick, looked more like a physical receiver through training camp, but he couldn’t buy a snap in a real game. He had just five offensive plays before today. The guy’s a big target with a little juice. Durham doesn’t have much juice, but the 2023 fifth-round pick is an even bigger target and he has made impressive catches in his limited opportunities. His TD catch today was his first. What a day for the Bucs’ front office, getting huge production from late-round tight ends with the season on the line.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/bucs-played-pissed-off-on-offense-today/|Bucs Played Pissed Off On Offense|If Liam Coen coached the Bucs in an angry mood last week, do you blame him? And he probably wasn’t the only guy attached to the offense who was peeved. The way the Bucs’ offense played, specifically in the first half today, Coen and the offense need to be that angry each week. The Bucs had six possessions in the first half. They scored on their first five giving them a 27-7 lead on the Stinking Panthers. Joe doesn’t blame Coen if he was p!ssed in the days leading up to Sunday. The Bucs offense clobbered the playoff-bound Chargers just like they did to Carolina in the first half today. But against Dallas? It was shameful how the Bucs showed up. Sloppy play. Almost appeared unprepared. Joe asked Bucs left tackle Tristan Wirfs about the offense. Joe mentioned to him it appeared the offense played peeved and upset that they let the game in Dallas get away from them. “Yeah, that’s pretty good,” Wirfs said of Joe’s observation. “I think we just knew what we needed to do. We had to come out fast.” And start fast the Bucs did. The Bucs are now 9-1 when scoring first. “That was pretty huge,” Wirfs said. “That kick-started everything.” In the first half alone, the Bucs racked up 347 yards of offense (551 yards for the game). If Coen gave his offense a tongue-lashing for their shameful early showing in Dallas, then hats off to him. The Bucs had to do something to jolt the offense, a kick in the posterior to wake them up. The pass defense is so far gone Joe isn’t sure Bobby Knight could get their attention. What good would hollering do? The offense? It’s too good to play flaccid football like it did in Dallas.|2024-12-29 17:25:00|298|17|8|Liam Coen|Bucs offense plays aggressively after disappointing loss.|2|Mixed sentiment with some optimism and frustration about team performance.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Hydra"", ""post"": ""Steve Wilkes benched him and had him playing scout team edge"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""29th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""5:28"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""MadMax"", ""post"": ""Last week was drunk football\u2026(i dont mean anyone was drunk) just a term, bot you just couldnt figure out what just happened.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/jason-licht-talks-shaq-barrett/|Jason Licht Talks Shaq Barrett|On a day when the Tampa Bay edge rush exploded with three sacks, Bucs sacks king Shaq Barrett was on the sidelines pumping up the troops and preparing to play next Sunday. Shaq was signed Friday and the Bucs were super excited to make it happen. “He was going to sign on Monday but we signed him yesterday,” Licht told the Buccaneers Radio Network. “…There were a lot of teams that wanted Shaq. He wanted to come home.” Home, of course, is Tampa, where Shaq lives with his large family after five seasons as a Buccaneers. The Bucs cut him early this year and Shaq signed with Miami in March but retired in July. He decided he wanted back in the game and, Joe has been told, Shaq has been training hard for weeks. Licht says Shaq Barrett is getting ready for next week and it was clear Licht expects him on the field against the slimy Saints. Barrett, 32, could be a heck of a situational pass rusher. The Bucs quickly will see if he has anything left in the tank. But Joe’s also interested in Shaq helping coach up the Bucs’ edge rushers with his experience. Is it coincidence that Anthony Nelson, Chris Braswell and YaYa Diaby had sacks today?

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/the-lucky-duck-helps-bucs-on-punt-return/|The Lucky Duck Helps Bucs On Punt Return|It had to be the duck. For those not at The Licht House today or not watching on CBS, one of the wildest plays Joe has seen — not so much for the play but who/what was involved — unfolded midway through the third quarter that pretty much sealed the Bucs win over the Stinking Panthers. Joe is beginning to believe the football gods were protecting the duck. “Duck?” you ask. Yes, duck. You know, quack, quack? The Bucs held the Stinking Panthers, forcing a punt from their own territory. Just before the snap, cameras, both on TV and on the JumboTron at The Licht House, showed a duck had landed on the field and hung out maybe two or three steps from Bucs punt returner Trey Palmer. (Palmer, Joe was told by Buccaneers Radio Network sideline reporter T.J. Rives, was visibly startled when the duck waddled near him). The football gods apparently didn’t want the poor thing to get trampled. So instead, the football gods called upon Joe Tryon-Shoyinka to save the duck. “I’m not even supposed to like ducks,” JTS laughed, reminding Joe he went to Washington — the Oregon Ducks’ bitter rival. “Had to save the duck!” JTS did. He blocked Johnny Hekker’s punt (his very first playing any level of football), which rolled right to J.J. Russell who scooped up the loose ball and returned it 23 yards for a score. “Man, it just bounced into my hands,” Russell told Joe after the game. “I had to get my hands on it.” After the play, the duck was still on the field and a Bucs staffer shooed it to the sideline amid the crowd chanting, “Duh-KEEE … Duh-KEEE … Duh-KEEE!” That had to be the reason JTS blocked a punt, no?

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/mike-evans-is-85-yards-shy-of-1000-bucs-took-yards-away-from-him/|Mike Evans Is 85 Yards Shy Of 1,000; Bucs Took Yards Away From Him|Yeah, Joe told all the interns at JoeBucsFan.com world headquarters to attach the wall padding early in today’s fourth quarter. The game was over. The Bucs led Carolina 41-14 early and had the ball in Panthers territory. It was a 3rd-and-7 play at Carolina’s 21 yard line. Baker Mayfield completed a six-yard throw to Mike Evans, but Jadeveon Clowney jumped offsides. Todd Bowles accepted the penalty, which took six yards away from Mike Evans’ total — and then Jalen McMillan scored a touchdown on the next play. That ended Evans’ great day. Man, Joe sure hopes those six yards aren’t what cost Evans his 11th consecutive 1,000-yard season. After a beastly 8 catches for 97 yards today and two touchdowns in the blowout win against the Panthers, Evans now has 915 yards this season on 65 catches with 11 TDs. With 85 yards next Sunday, Evans can tie Jerry Rice’s all-time streak of 11 seasons of 1,000 yards or more. Joe’s prayer is that Evans can do it early in the game without absorbing cheap shots by the slimy Saints. And man, if those six yards cost him the record or expose him to a debilitating hit, Joe will not be in a forgiving mood.|2024-12-29 16:34:00|205|64|6|Mike Evans|Mike Evans close to 1|4|Mixed sentiments about prioritizing player records over team wins and coaching decisions.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Matt_PcAfee"", ""post"": ""Oh yeah, the slimy saints will cheap shot him"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""29th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""4:38"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""firethecannons"", ""post"": ""there was no reason not to put Evans out there for yards after Baker came out, Trask could of thrown him a few receptions.

You like that, Falcons? And Mayfield doesn’t even get to play against the Bucs’ defense! Mayfield belted Carolina with five touchdown passes today and upped his season completion percentage to over 71 percent — 71 percent! Tom Brady never did that. Mayfield’s final line today was 27-of-32 for 359 yards. Somehow, Buccaneers Ring of Honor general manager Jason Licht found a stud QB walking the streets and then re-signed him on the cheap after a Pro Bowl season. Who does that? For the 2024 season,, Mayfield is on pace for 4,546 yards passing, 41 TDs and 15 interceptions. Joe doesn’t take any of this special stuff for granted.|2024-12-29 16:23:00|136|52|8|Baker Mayfield|Mayfield excelling|7|Comments overall express optimism, praising Baker and the offense, advocating for Coen's retention.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Again"", ""post"": ""Fire Todd"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""29th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""4:24"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""BucU"", ""post"": ""What Again said\u2026"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""29th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""4:26"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""PSL Bob"", ""post"": ""Outstanding game by Mayfield and the Bucs offense.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/another-winning-season-for-todd-bowles/|Another Winning Season For Todd Bowles|Has Todd Bowles done a good job this season? Joe’s answer to the question is, ‘There’s one more game.” The subject is explosive on social media and all over town. The Bucs have a 9-7 record after clobbering the Panthers today and the offense is humming as the postseason approaches. But that final stanza against the slimy Saints next week is just about everything. The Saints have no quarterback and look like a team waving a white flag. They lost to the Raiders today in New Orleans. The Raiders! Don’t expect Joe to moan or cry about a 10-7 Bucs record. No chance. But Joe might have a stroke if the Bucs can’t close out the season against a sadsack Saints team that already fired its coach. Keep in mind the Bucs blew out the Saints in October. Kudos to Bowles for keeping his team confident and steady — yeah, that includes the soft pass defense — and primed for a postseason run. Any Bucs fan during The Lost Decade (2009-2019) knows just how stunning and special a winning season is — and how sweet a fourth consecutive Bucs division crown would be.|2024-12-29 16:11:00|193|65|8|Todd Bowles|Bucs on track for playoff success after solid season.|5|Mixed sentiments on Coach Bowles with varying degrees of optimism and pessimism.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Pmike"", ""post"": ""See you in 2025 Coach Bowles!"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""29th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""4:14"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Seminole Bill"", ""post"": ""Go Commanders!

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/buccaneers-48-carolina-14/|Buccaneers 48, Carolina 14|Tampa Bay answered the bell! Take that, Todd Bowles haters. The Bucs hammered and hammered and hammered away at the Panthers for a total of 550-plus yards of offense. The Bucs are now 9-7 in first place and awaiting the Falcons (8-7)-Commanders (10-5) game tonight. What an offensive display. Baker Mayfield spread the ball around to nine targets and new names landed in the mix. No Cade Otton? No problem. Payne Durham rose up to grab 2 catches for 36 yards and his first NFL touchdown. Rookie Devin Culp had his first 3 catches of the year for 52 yards on four targets. No superlative is too much for this Bucs offense. Bucky Irving busted 1,000 yards on the season with 20 carries for 113 yards, plus 4 catches for 77 yards. Mike Evans had 8 catches for 97 yards but he should have had more. Mayfield dropped 5 TDs on Carolina — 27-of-32 for 359 yards. Some fans even consider Carolina to be a good team! The Bucs defense showed a few ugly warts but did enough and found a pass rush. In all, it was a special day.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/this-is-the-kind-of-game-that-can-get-a-coach-fired/|“This Is The Kind Of Game That Can Get A Coach Fired”|Shame on the Buccaneers fans rooting for Tampa Bay to lose today. Joe has seen and heard some of you. You don’t like head coach Todd Bowles. You don’t think he can win a Super Bowl. So you want him out on the next flight to Jersey. And you think the way to make that happens is for the Bucs to lose today to the Panthers and choke away a trip to the playoffs. Shame, shame, shame. The Bucs are 8-7 and in great shape to have their best record since winning 13 games in 2021. Still, the haters are flooding social media and banging bass drums and walking down Redington Beach. Embarrassing. However, they’re accurate in understanding that this is a must-win game for Todd Bowles. “This is the kind of game that can get a coach fired,” said Ira Kaufman on his popular podcast. It’s no hot take from The Sage of Tampa Bay Sports, who is a friend of Bowles. It’s just NFL reality that Ira has seen through 49 seasons covering the sport. “This is the game, coming off the Dallas game. Don’t lose to a 4-11 [Panthers] team when your season’s on the line,” Kaufman cautioned. Joe agrees. Not only are the Panthers bad, the Bucs are at home and the Panthers just pulled the plug on their best offensive player. Joe was looking for style points against the Panthers four weeks ago. Not today. It’s Week 17. The Bucs are the better team. Just go show it or a lot of jobs should be in jeopardy.|2024-12-29 12:06:00|262|45|5|Todd Bowles|Pressure on coach to win; fans criticized for negative behavior.|4|Fans express mixed feelings about the Bucs coach, leaning toward dissatisfaction with some hope.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""El HEFE"", ""post"": ""It\u2019s doesn\u2019t matter because most of these fans came with Brady and don\u2019t know what to do with themselves anymore now that he is retired bucs fans win lose or draw we still part of THE KREWE because we bleed this ish"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""29th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""12:12"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""El HEFE"", ""post"": ""It doesn\u2019t matter most of these fans came with Brady and don\u2019t know what to do with themselves now that he is retired Bucs fans win lose or draw we bleed Tampa let\u2019s go Bucs"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""29th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""12:14"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""David Kilmer"", ""post"": ""Yes Joe, definitely want to see the Bucs win, even though I have little hope for the playoffs with this defense.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/the-gameplan-is-centered-around-bucky-irving/|“The Gameplan Is Centered Around Bucky Irving”|Interesting words from a league insider standing on the field of The Licht House this morning. ESPN NFL insider Jeff Darlington is covering the game, and the pride of Pinellas county said with authority that the Bucs’ “gameplan is centered around Bucky Irving” today and the team doesn’t care who knows it. Irving is the guy to take advantage of the Panthers’ league-worst run defense, per Darlington, and Carolina will see Bucky, Bucky and more Bucky. In the team’s Dec. 1 game Irving had 25 carries for 152 yards and a touchdown, the rookie’s breakout game. So why would the Bucs tell a popular guy on the ESPN pregame show what they plan to do? Bucs fans can chew on that 80 minutes before kickoff. Studio co-host Rex Ryan, the former defensive guru Jets and Bills head coach, was all-in with tactic, saying Todd Bowles would be crazy not to hammer Irving and keep Baker Mayfield from making a key mistake.|2024-12-29 11:49:00|161|12|7|Bucky Irving|Bucs gameplan focuses on utilizing Irving against Panthers run defense.|5|Mixed sentiments with some optimism and skepticism about player performance and game strategies.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""BucsBeast"", ""post"": ""Panthers are tanking for the draft but, Bowles will keep it a close game with poor play calling and game management."", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""29th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""11:51"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""LEE COHEN"", ""post"": ""So Bucky will start?"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""29th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""11:51"", ""am""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""The Placebo Kid"", ""post"": ""Well he\u2019s the single most dynamic player on the field for either team.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/luke-goedeke-recounts-battling-micah-parsons/|Luke Goedeke Recounts Battling Micah Parsons|One cool thing to come out of the gut-punch loss to the Cowboys was that maybe Bucs right tackle Luke Goedeke is Pro Bowl material. Goedeke has had a solid season, especially since he came back from a four-week stint locked in concussion protocol. Sunday may have been the pinnacle. Cowboys pass rushing beast Micah Parsons often squarded up on Goedeke. The Penn State product “only” had one sack and no quarterback hits bouncing back and forth across the Cowboys’ defensive front. Goedeke came away from that bout with all the repsect in the world for Parsons. “He’s obviously one of the best pass rushers in the NFL,” Goedeke said. “They are the second-best pass rush unit and that’s with him missing four or five games. “So with him, that makes [Dallas] really, truly, a force to be reckoned with. He is a phenomenal pass rusher. He is just relentless. Super athletic.” How good is Parsons? “I would put him above Bosa, for sure,” Goedeke said. What Goedeke didn’t say is which Bosa. The Bucs played both Joey and Nick Bosa this season and neither went nuts while Goedeke tangled with them. Goedeke was quick to tell Joe that Parsons brought out the best in him and the matchup improved his game. “That makes me a helluva lot better player,” Goedeke said of dueling with Parsons. “To face that that type of competition and to live up to expectations, and persevere, I think we held our own pretty well. “Confidence [is] 90 percent of the game.” Now, will Goedeke’s season give Pro Bowl voters enough confidence to vote for the pride of Central Michigan? Or will Goedeke’s forced four-game absence doom him from playing in that flag football game?|2024-12-29 01:11:00|289|17|8|Luke Goedeke|Goedeke impressed by battling Micah Parsons|4|Mixed sentiments with some praise for players but frustration with coaching and stadium locations.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""MadMax"", ""post"": ""We find a way to beat the dodo birds, the lions and the chargers\u2026.so how do we find ways to lose close games to teams that dont mean jit?!"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""29th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""3:09"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""garro"", ""post"": ""I Love Goedeke\u2019s attitude and honesty.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/past-the-point-of-pressure/|“Past The Point Of Pressure”|So here is the deal: The Bucs win today and then start lighting candles through the early evening hours hoping the Commandos can beat the Dixie Chicks. A Bucs win and a Dixie Chicks loss and the Bucs are back on top of the division and control their own destiny next week for the NFC South title. Lose today combined with a Dixie Chicks win and it’s all over. The Bucs, for the first time since 2019, would watch the playoffs on TV just like you and Joe. If both the Bucs and Dixie Chicks lose, then the Bucs must beat the slimy Saints next week and somehow a miracle happens and the Stinking Panthers win on the road at Atlanta next week. So last week Joe asked Bucs corner Zyon McCollum if he is feeling the pressure. “Pressure? Not necessarily,” McCollum said. McCollum wasn’t being arrogant or flippant. The Bucs, he said, have been playing under pressure for so long, it’s second nature. “I think we are past the point of pressure,” McCollum said. “At this point in the season, the pressure has been on for a long time. About the past five weeks. “We know the assignment. We know we have to win to move on.” So Joe also asked McCollum if, after the Bucs played such a sloppy game in Dallas and in the process lost the division lead, it was best to quickly forget Dallas and just lock in on Carolina. Yes and no, McCollum said. “Definitely don’t want to forget about it,” McCollum said about the Dallas dump. “You want to learn from the mistakes you made, both as a team and individually. “For sure, you want to get that taste out of your mouth. You want to get back to work. You want to get focused on the future and what is coming at us. “Right now we have to beat the Panthers. So sure, you could say that [it’s best to move on].” If the Bucs aren’t careful, they could wake up tomorrow morning not planning on beating the slimy Saints, but ordering U-Hauls and booking their flights to the DR or Tulum.|2024-12-29 00:44:00|360|16|8|Zyon McCollum|Bucs face critical games to determine playoff fate.|7|Fans are hopeful, critical of coaching, frustrated with reliance on other teams, and critical of division.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""HC Grover"", ""post"": ""Go Commodes!!

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/win-the-battle-lose-the-war/|Win The Battle; Lose The War|If the following takes place, the Bucs will be fortunate to win this afternoon. Per Seth Walder of BSPN, a man who never met a number he didn’t like, believes rookie receiver Jalen McMillan will light up the Stinking Panthers today. And if that happens, Joe thinks it is a bad omen. Bold prediction: Bucs wide receiver Jalen McMillan will record a season high in receiving yards (76 or more). He has 50-plus yards in each of his past three games. And at least part of the time against the Panthers he’ll face Michael Jackson, who is allowing 1.6 yards per route run — more than average for an outside corner, per NFL Next Gen Stats. Here is why Joe dreads this: Since Chris Godwin got hurt, the Bucs are really, really bad against man-to-man defenses in the passing game (with the exception of Mike Evans). Guess who actually is playing pretty well of late using man-to-man defense? The Stinking Panthers. So for McMillan to have a career afternoon, that tells Joe a couple of things. 1. The Bucs, foolishly, are going to try to throw their way to a win, very likely in the rain. Does anyone not remember how the Bucs needed a miracle by Anthony Nelson in Charlotte earlier this month to survive an overtime win? 2. If McMillan has a career afternoon, that tells Joe the Bucs need to throw because they are behind. No, no, no. Joe doesn’t want to see this at all. Nothing against McMillan, but the only guy’s record the Bucs need to concern themselves with is Mike Evans’. Other than that, the way the Bucs can pound the ball, that’s all they should be doing today.|2024-12-29 00:01:00|285|26|5|Jalen McMillan|Mixed feelings about rookie receiver Jalen McMillan's performance prediction.|4|Mixed sentiment with cautious optimism and concerns about various factors.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""firethecannons"", ""post"": ""It is likely to rain and lightning, Bucs need to run the ball and keep it up until the Panthers defense gets tired then keep doing it with intermittent passes to Evans and McMillan.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/gameday-tampa-bay-317/|GameDay Tampa Bay|Game 16 Stinking Panthers (4-11) at Bucs (8-7) Kickoff: 1 p.m. TV: CBS (WTSP-TV Channel 10, locally) with Ian Eagle, Charles Davis and Evan Washburn.  Streaming: NFL+, Paramount+. (Geographic restrictions apply; subscription may be required). Radio: Buccaneers Radio Network WXTB-FM 97.9 in the Tampa-St. Petersburg region (Transmisiones de radio en español en WTMP-FM 96.1 y WMGG-AM 1470 en Tampa). Additional stations throughout Florida on the Buccaneers Radio Network can be found here. The game also will be broadcast on SiriusXM Channel 230 (Buccaneers Radio Network feed). Weather: Going to be a hit-and-miss wet day today, per AccuWeather.com. Early in the morning and during the second half, as of midnight Sunday, AccuWeather is predicting thunderstorms. But, as with Florida weather in the winter, it is just as likely to rain heavily on and off all day. So pack your rain gear. Temperatures for tailgaters will be in the low-70s and should climb to 76 in the second half. Odds: Per Hard Rock Bet, as of midnight, Bucs -8 (-450); over/under 48. Referees: Clay Martin and his gang lean ever so slightly to the away teams. Home teams are 47-44 in the career of Clay Martin and his outfit. However, home teams in division games in Martin’s career are slightly below .500 at 13-15.  Overall, Martin and his posse are 10th in the NFL in flags thrown. However, Martin and his gang have thrown the fourth-most penalties on home teams (103). Injuries: Stinking Panthers — Out LB Josey Jewell (head/neck/quad), CB Chau Smith-Wade (illness/chest). Doubtful: CB Jaycee Horn (hip), T Taylor Moten (knee). Questionable: OLB Jadeveon Clowney (knee/elbow), OLB Cam Gil (illness), WR Xavier Leggette (hip/wrist), G Damien Lewis (illness/ankle), DE A’Shawn Robinson (knee/illness), OLB D.J. Wonnum (shoulder/knee). Bucs — Out: TE Cade Otton (knee), WR Sterling Sheperd (hamstring/foot), S Antoine Winfield (knee). Questionable: ILB K.J. Britt (ankle), WR Kameron Johnson (ankle), S Jordan Whitehead (pec). Outlook: Must-win. That’s the way the Bucs have to look at this. Must-win. Oh, the Bucs could still choke away this game, but then would have to pray that the Dixie Chicks lose two straight. Highly, highly unlikely. The Bucs painted themselves into this corner. Gagging away a late-lead in Atlanta, coughing up a bad game against Atlanta a second time and then showing up like homeless people in Dallas acting fully unprepared, playing sloppier than sloppy football and allowed Troy Aikman Cooper Rush to slice and dice the defense in the first half — Kirk Cousins style! Are the Bucs desperate? Joe would say, yes. They let Bucs sack king Shaq Barrett walk last offseason (for good reason as it appeared Father Time caught up with him). Now, with no training camp, no practices the Bucs are hoping Shaq comes in (if activated) and rescues an embarrassing, shameful edge rush where backup outside linebacker Anthony Nelson leads all Bucs edge rushers in sacks (three). The amount of draft capital the organization has spent on edge rushers this decade only to see damn near zero to show for it is a complete and total embarrassment. So yeah, bringing Shaq out of mothballs tells Joe not only have the Bucs given up on their edge rushers not named “Nelson,” but are borderline panicking. This is right up there when former Bucs rock star general manager Mark Dominik signed slovenly Albert Haynesworth in a desperate, panic move to try to get a pass rush. Haynesworth of course didn’t get one sack in eight games and he never played another snap of football after he finished the 2011 season with the Bucs. Look, Joe loves Shaq and this move it’s a bad move. More of a “Hail Mary.” But sometimes a “Hail Mary” works. But let’s be real. Shaq retired and hasn’t played a down of football since last January. Of course, Joe hopes he has something, anything left in his tank. But that’s where the Bucs are, in part, because of too many slip-ups and bad games and scant production. The Bucs are on the cusp of elimination. They now have to play for two wins these next two weeks and light a candle the Commandos handle the Dixie Chicks tonight. Since it should be a rainy day today and the Stinking Panthers have the NFL’s worst run defense, Joe would pound the ball. We shall see what happens. Cross your fingers, Bucs fans. Fun facts: Last week Stinking Panthers QB Bryce Young had his first two-touchdown game. … WR Adam Thielen had eight catches for 99 yards and a touchdown in the overtime loss to the Bucs earlier this month. WR David Moore had five catches against the Bucs in the teams’ last meeting. … OLB Jadeveon Clowney had a sack against the Bucs in Week 13. Looks for his fourth road game in a row with a tackle for loss. … CB Mike Jackson is fifth in the NFL with 14 pass breakups. … Bucs QB Baker Mayfield and Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow are the only quarterbacks with at least five games with 300 or more yards with two touchdown passes. If Mayfield throws one touchdown pass today, he will join Tom Brady as the only Bucs quarterbacks to throw for at least 35 touchdowns in a single season. Brady did it twice with 40 and 43 touchdowns. Mayfield currently leads all NFC quarterbacks with 34 touchdowns thrown. … With seven catches last week giving him 50 catches this season, RB Rachaad White joins Alvin Kamara as only the second running back with 50 catches in each of his first three seasons in the NFL. … WR Mike Evans needs 182 receiving yards for his 11th-consecutive 1,000-yard season. … ILB Lavonte David is one tackle for loss away from becoming the first player in 24 seasons to reach 10 seasons of 100 tackles and 10 tackles for loss in the same season. … DT Calijah Kancey has 6.5 sacks and 10 tackles for loss in 10 games this season. … OLB YaYa Diaby has two sacks in three career games against Carolina.|2024-12-29 00:00:00|1006|23|'4|GameDay Tampa Bay|Bucs face pivotal must-win game amidst challenges.'|2|Mixed sentiments with negative and neutral comments outweighing positive ones.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""firethecannons"", ""post"": ""when are you ever going to retire these poor women???"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""29th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""12:33"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Joe"", ""post"": ""when are you ever going to retire these poor women???"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""29th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""12:46"", ""am""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""Pickgrin"", ""post"": ""\u201cintoxicated, out of control and difficult to deal with\u2026.. having sex in a bathroom stall before getting in a fight with patrons at Banana Joe\u2019s \u201d "", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""29th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""2:21"", ""am""]}, ""commenter3"": {""username"": ""Bucco Bruce"", ""post"": ""Kick off is at noon not 3pm"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""29th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""3:09"", ""am""]}, ""commenter4"": {""username"": ""garro"", ""post"": ""I seem to remember some Bears cheerleaders in the middle of some \u201ctrouble\u201d many years ago as well.
