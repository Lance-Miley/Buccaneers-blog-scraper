Frangie is outraged that Bucs offensive coordinator Liam Coen passed on a second interview to be Jaguars head coach today and stuck with the Bucs… And then and then Jacksonville fired its general manager, Trent Baalke, hours later. “This one rattled me,” Frangie said of today’s Jaguars events. Frangie ordered his big bosses with the team to pick up the phone and call Coen. As seasoned NFL fans know well, coaches’ contracts often mean little and there’s always a price to tear one up. Frangie said he would hire Hall of Fame Jaguars left tackle Tony Boselli immediately for their vacant general manager gig — and he expects it to happen. He said Boselli, who is tight with Jags ownership, is an ideal fit and a high-energy postive guy that could recruit Coen. “The minute [Boselli] gets the job, I going to call him and tell him to make a run back at Liam Coen,” he said. Frangie said his sources told him young coaches around the NFL were spooked by Baalke because of the respect they have for fired Jags coach Doug Pederson. Apparently, they feel like if Pederson couldn’t last in Jacksonville and Baalke turned on him, they want no part it. Joe expects Coen will do the smart thing and stay with the Bucs. What’s he going to do? Tear up his fat new raise for a chance to meet the Jaguars in person for the first time with no guarantees? That would make no sense.|2025-01-22 16:32:00|266|64|5|Frank Frangie|Frangie urges Jaguars to pursue Liam Coen for head coach.|4|Mixed sentiments, leaning towards pessimism, skepticism, and criticisms of the Jaguars' organization.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Tbbucs3"", ""post"": ""Maybe they can make a run at Urban Meyer?"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""22nd,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""4:34"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Jeff"", ""post"": ""Coen can always be an OC again.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/will-chris-godwin-find-las-vegas-leverage/|Will Chris Godwin Find Las Vegas Leverage?|If you were new Raiders co-owner Tom Brady, who would you target to overhaul your team culture? First, you’d want to play puppeteer and find a general manager whose loyalty is firm. That may sound like a harsh characterization of Brady and today’s Raiders hire of assistant Bucs general manager John Spytek to be their GM. But hey, Joe is direct. Spytek was a younger Brady teammate at the University of Michigan and with the Bucs. Second, you’d look for some bedrock players you trust to set an elite daily example, a Brady example. And you’d prefer a loyal friend or two you can call to find out what’s happening in the locker room. Enter Chris Godwin, a pending free agent, the guy who gave Tom Brady is jersey number in Tampa. Joe knows Brady was a confidant and a sometimes mentor for Godwin during Godwin’s rehabilitation from a torn ACL late in the 2021 season. Brady had experience with that specific rehab. Godwin grinded his way back for the 2022 season and was Brady’s go-to receiver with a team-leading 142 targets. The trust and respect is there. And frankly, everyone at One Buc Palace respects Godwin for being an ultimate pro. So will Brady and Spytek now come calling for Godwin when the free agency dinner bell rings? Las Vegas has no quarterback, but they also have a mountain of salary cap room and might be willing to overlook question marks about Godwin’s health knowing he’s valuable whether he’s 100 percent or not. Joe is leery.|2025-01-22 15:45:00|257|66|6|Chris Godwin|Raiders consider pursuing Chris Godwin in free agency.|6|Comments show mixed sentiments on Godwin's future, some optimistic, others citing concerns and uncertainties.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""813bucboi"", ""post"": ""i wouldnt doubt it\u2026."", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""22nd,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""3:51"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""AL121976"", ""post"": ""I think Godwin will stay"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""22nd,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""3:54"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""Dewey Selmon"", ""post"": ""Is Kenny Stabler\u2019s number retired?

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/john-spytek-takes-raiders-gig/|John Spytek Takes Raiders Gig|Tom Brady did it. The former Bucs quarterback, who knows now former Bucs assistant general manager John Spytek intimately, just stole his former Michigan teammate from the Bucs. You got it. Per Adam Schefter of BSPN, Spytek is the new general manager of the Raiders. Joe thought this would happen weeks ago. In fact, Joe was really scared that if Spytek got the Raiders job, he would bring along Liam Coen. Things rarely happen as they seem in public, so Joe suspects Coen already knew Spytek was gone and still re-upped his contract with the Bucs. Spytek’s loss hurts. But it was Licht who hired Spytek from the Broncos to replace former Bucs director of player personnel Jon Robinson when Robinson got the Titans job. And since Robinson is still unemployed, it wouldn’t shock Joe if he made his way back to Tampa. If Licht has to go outside the building to replace Spytek, Joe is confident Licht will find the right man. He did with Spytek.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/report-liam-coen-not-promised-to-be-todd-bowles-successor/|Report: Liam Coen Not Promised To Be Todd Bowles’ Successor|Well here’s a very interesting tidbit about Bucs offensive coordinator Liam Coen’s new contract with the team to keep him in Tampa. When Joe learned this morning that the Bucs had retained Coen with a new contract, “this Joe” figured there could be a clause in the contract that Coen would be the coach-in-waiting when Bucs coach Todd Bowles retired. Bowles, 61, has been somewhat open that the Bucs are his last stop in the NFL — that whenever his Bucs tenure ends, that’s it. He’s retiring. Given that his son, linebacker Troy Bowles, transferred from Georgia to Michigan over the holidays, Joe thought perhaps Bowles’ time with the Bucs may be limited. It’s one thing to travel back and forth from Tampa to Athens to watch your son play ball. It’s quite different commuting from Tampa to Ann Arbor (and those notorious Big Ten west coast road trips). Despite this, a suggestion from Bill Belichick consigliere Michael Lombardi late last season that Bowles was retiring was flatly disputed by Bowles himself as unadulterated horse fertilizer. However, Joe’s assumption (never a good thing) might be dead wrong about Coen succeeding Bowles as Bucs head coach. Per Jonathan Jones of CBS, there is no such language in Coen’s new contract. @jjones9: Liam Coen gets an extension and a raise with Tampa Bay, but according to people with knowledge of the contract details, there is no “coach-in-waiting” clause for Coen with the Bucs. This is about continuing to build in Tampa as one of the league’s highest-paid OCs. This is intriguing. So, outside of Team Glazer loot (always an important factor) Coen, 39, really had no other professional incentive outside of personal relationships and maybe a chance to make a Super Bowl run in 2025 to turn down a head coaching gig with another No. 1 overall pick at quarterback. Coen has been very open that an NFL head coaching job is his dream. Then again, Coen has also said in the same media availabilities that he’s having the most fun he’s ever had as an offensive coordinator. Joe guesses if you are paid well enough to have fun, your dreams can be put on pause.  |2025-01-22 12:30:00|364|94|7|Liam Coen|Coen's NFL head coaching ambitions in question without succession clause.|4|Mixed feelings ranging from optimism about Coen staying to concerns about defense and contract details.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""darengibo"", ""post"": ""Ok, so here is what I am manifesting:  Tampa wins Super Bowl this coming season, and Todd then retires and walks out ON TOP\u2026.  no hit to the ego.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/baker-mayfield-played-a-role-in-liam-coen-staying/|Baker Mayfield Played A Role In Liam Coen Staying|Well, here’s a very interesting tidbit from a guy Joe knows has a direct pipeline to Bucs shot-callers. At lunch today, Joe will uncork a bottle of Bulleit Bourbon Frontier Whiskey and raise a glass to Team Glazer and the Bucs for stepping up and keeping the best offensive coordinator the Bucs have ever had whose name is not “Bucco Bruce Arians.” And this came hours before Bucs offensive coordinator Liam Coen was to interview with the Jags today for the second time this coaching cycle to be the Jaguars’ head coach. The move was replete with a new contract for Coen. Cha-ching. Well done. The co-host of “Good Morning Football,” seen weekdays on NFL Network, Peter Schrager, took to Twitter to offer his take on this great day in Bucs history. Joe knows who Schrager speaks with at One Buc Palace so Schrager’s Bucs takes aren’t flippant guesses. Schrager suggested that not only was this a team effort by Bucs suits to keep Coen from bolting to Jacksonville (WTVT-TV Channel 13 meteorologist Paul Dellegatto said it was too cold and snowy in Jacksonville for Coen), Baker Mayfield also played a role. @PSchrags: The Glazers, Jason Licht, Baker, Todd Bowles, and Mike Greenberg, who was a first round interview for the Jets GM job, all deserve credit in getting Liam Coen to return to Tampa Bay. This has been in the works and a testament to the leadership and what they’re building in TB. So, did Mayfield show up at Coen’s front door last night, six-pack in hand, and beg Coen to stay? Did Mayfield call up Bucs AC/DC-loving general manager Jason Licht and threaten to demand a trade to Jacksonville if Coen slipped out of One Buc Palace? Did Mayfield text Team Glazer and say he would take a discount if that extra loot could find its way into Coen’s Roth IRA account? This is all very interesting to Joe, but an element of this seems to ring true: Coen preferred to work with Mayfield over Trevor Lawrence.  |2025-01-22 12:00:00|339|60|'8|Baker Mayfield|Coen stays in Tampa|7|Fans are optimistic about the team, Coen staying, and improving the defense.

I\u2019m not even going to go into the need to run parallel to the line of scrimmage because you obviously can\u2019t comprehend the 1 yard concept, so we\u2019ll leave it easy, 1 yard.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/another-culture-win-for-the-buccaneers/|Another Culture Win For The Buccaneers|Not only do ex-Bucs want to return to the Tampa Bay roster while current players take less money than they could earn on the open market, offensive coordinator Liam Coen just jumped at the chance to stay in Tampa and toss a potential head coaching opportunity out the window. That’s what Joe calls a winning culture. No, that doesn’t read “winning defense.” Remember Greg Schiano’s famous “laughingstock” line to Bucs suiteholders 11 1/2 years ago? Man, the Bucs have come an awfully long way under the leadership of Buccaneers Ring of Honor general manager Jason Licht, Team Glazer and, yes, Todd Bowles. They had help along the way from Tom Brady and Bucco Bruce Arians, but for the Bucs’ current culture. the credit goes to Bowles, Licht and Team Glazer. (Pick your own order.) Retaining Coen today is such a massive “W” as it relates to the team culture. Coen obviously likes everything he sees at One Buc Palace, now and for his future. Joe had a very private conversation with a Bucs coach last year and was told how blown away Coen was by how much Day 1 respect, lattitude and freedom he was given by Bowles. Not that Bowles wasn’t aware and involved, just that Bowles wouldn’t cross a line and showed the ultimate professional respect to his coordinator. Whether you think the Bucs are wasting time with Bowles or believe he’s building something special, there is no denying that the Bucs have grown exponentially for the better.|2025-01-22 11:42:00|250|37|9|Buccaneers|Buccaneers culture thriving with loyal players and coaches.|5|Mixed sentiments regarding Todd Bowles, optimism about team growth, desire for a defensive change.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Josh"", ""post"": ""Look, I criticize Todd Bowles as much as anyone, and his time management is often maddening.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/todd-bowles-speculation-can-finally-end/|Todd Bowles Speculation Can Finally End|With Bucs offensive playcaller Liam Coen officially returning for the 2025 season, perhaps the rabid and divisive speculation of Todd Bowles getting fired this month will be put to bed.  Joe was impressed by how many fans and media seemingly were trying to will Bowles off the plank. Man, these folks are passionate. It even reached a new level yesterday. Joe applauds the enthusiasm, but Bowles getting launched was not in the cards, as Joe was writing here for the past few weeks and stating on the Ira Kaufman Podcast. Still, Joe expects some will continue the drumbeat for Bowles’ head before the new league year begins. Bowles, however, clearly enters the 2025 season on a hot seat in the minds of nearly every Bucs fan, and that likely includes the folks signing the checks. Win more or go home. Joe wonders if it might be weird for Bowles knowing Coen, now his potential 2026 replacement and the fans’ new favorite son, is his day-to-day dance partner.|2025-01-22 10:58:00|167|87|7|Todd Bowles|Speculation on Bowles' job status amid Coen's return.|2|Mixed sentiment with concerns about coaches and defense, some support for continuity.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Cybetsecurity_intern"", ""post"": ""Get rid of mediocrity."", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""22nd,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""10:58"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Davenport"", ""post"": ""Bucs now need to push Bowles to hire a DC"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""22nd,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""11:01"", ""am""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""Lt.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/report-liam-coen-will-stay-with-bucs/|Report: Liam Coen Will Stay With Bucs|Yup. Team Glazer jumped off the top rope Randy “Macho Man” Savage style with a checkbook. With Elizabeth smiling from his corner.  Per NFL uber insider Adam Schefter of BSPN, Bucs offensive coordinator Liam Coen, who was to have interviewed today for the second time this coaching cycle to run the Jags, has removed his name from consideration with Jags owner Shad Khan and decided to stick around Tampa Bay and run the Bucs offense. With a new contract in hand.            @AdamSchefter: Buccaneers offensive coordinator Liam Coen is taking himself out of the running for the Jaguars’ head coaching job to stay in Tampa on a new contract that now will place him amongst the highest-paid coordinators in the NFL, per sources. Bucs are keeping their OC.            Celebrate! Celebrate, Bucs fans. Blow off work. Head to your local Hooters. Do shots. This is incredible news. Team Glazer stepped to the plate and blasted a pitch over the left field wall. This may be better than a playoff win. It’s that big in Joe’s eyes. Coen took a middling Bucs offense with a horrible ground game and turned it into one of the best offenses in Bucs history. Joe sincerely believes the Bucs will even have a better offense  this year in 2025 because the team will have a full season under its belt with Coen. This is a great day in Bucs history. Props to Team Glazer for stepping up and getting the job done.|2025-01-22 10:23:00|245|146|8|Liam Coen|Coen staying with Bucs|8|Fans are overwhelmingly positive and grateful for Liam Coen staying with the Bucs.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Leopold Stotch"", ""post"": ""Hallelujah!"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""22nd,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""10:24"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Ryan Hayes"", ""post"": ""LFB Liam Coen Year 2 LFB Baby"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""22nd,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""10:24"", ""am""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""Bucsfan1988"", ""post"": ""Saw the information on X."", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""22nd,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""10:25"", ""am""]}, ""commenter3"": {""username"": ""OHBucFan"", ""post"": ""Now Joe can drink because he\u2019s happy.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/baker-mayfield-is-not-jameis-winston/|Baker Mayfield Is Not Jameis Winston|OK, was last week’s fumble between Baker Mayfield and Jalen McMillan on a jet sweep awful? Yeah. But Joe cannot say the Bucs lost in the wild card round because of Mayfield, that’s harsh. So is a column excerpt by Jeff Chadiha of NFL.com. He typed that he believes Mayfield is a turnover machine and Bucs fans should expect Mayfield to turn the ball over once a game — or more. Chadiha pointed out Mayfield was tied with Kirk Cousins for the league lead in picks. In fact, Chadiha seemed so critical of Mayfield and his turnovers that Joe for a second through Chahida mistook Mayfield for America’s Quarterback, Mr. Entertainment, Jameis Winston. Last Joe checked the Bucs had the lead when Mayfield/McMillan fumbled. Aren’t the Bucs allowed to play defense? And the Bucs still had a chance to take the lead in the game until a promising drive fizzled due to an ill-timed snap. Maybe it is just Joe, but instead of blaming Mayfield, how about pinning some (all?) of the blame on the defense that couldn’t force Washington into one friggin’ punt? (Yeah, Joe knows the defense had two fourth down stops). To blame Mayfield for the playoff loss, Chadiha comes across as a hater.|2025-01-22 10:00:00|207|67|4|Baker Mayfield|Mayfield unfairly blamed for playoff loss despite defensive shortcomings.|4|Mixed sentiments about Baker Mayfield's performance, with varying views on his turnovers and leadership.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""JimBobBuc"", ""post"": ""I\u2019m not a Baker hater, but Bake needs to reduce his turnovers next year.

Yesterday, it published a story headlined, “Bucs Preparing For Liam Coen To Be Offered Jaguars Job.” Later in the day, however, that headline mysteriously changed to, “Bucs’ Liam Coen Emerging As Strongest Candidate For Jaguars Job.” That’s a significant edit. Also deleted from the article was a strong statement by reporter Rick Stroud. “The Bucs are bracing for Coen to be offered the Jaguars head coaching job, possibly as early as Wednesday when he interviews for the second time with the club,” he wrote before it vanished. No explanation or clarification was provided. Sadly, the original version was picked up by various national outlets and still appears websites now. So what happened? Why did someone scurry to delete what was written and then fail to publish a formal correction? It’s not hard to be transparent with fans.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/how-much-of-a-hit-will-bucs-take-if-liam-coen-bolts/|How Much Of A Hit Will Bucs Take If Liam Coen Bolts?|It is the NFL. Good coaches come. Good coaches go. Sometimes quicker than players. Joe has a bottle of Bulleit Frontier Whiskey at the ready today and the rest of the week in case word comes that offensive coordinator Liam Coen is gone. Joe doesn’t know how much that would set back the Bucs. But it is clear that it will to some degree. Let’s be real: If not for Coen’s high-powered offense, the Bucs don’t win the division and they don’t make the playoffs. If Coen goes to Jacksonville as head coach, it’s a good bet offensive line coach Kevin Carberry goes with him under the title of offensive coordinator (even though Coen technically would be the OC), which comes with a raise and some job security. What Carberry did with the Bucs’ offensive line is every bit as impressive as what Coen did with the entire offense. If Coen leaves, would Baker Mayfield have a third consecutive career year with the Bucs? How long would Mike Evans want to stick around if Coen leaves? Would Coen’s departure scare away Chris Godwin? Without Coen, would Bucky Irving have anywhere close to the same year in 2025 as he had in his rookie season? Joe has a gut feeling that if Coen leaves, the 2025 season will see the Bucs take a step back. Maybe more. The shame of a Coen departure would be great, Joe believes, because the offense wouldn’t get a chance to improve with the whole group having a full season of Coen’s offense under their belts and ready to reach greater heights as the offense progresses. If Coen leaves, this is gonna hurt.

The post-Brady course is well established. Two years ago, they brought in Baker and Canales, building a solid passing game to anchor the offense. An effective kicker was found. Canales betook himself and some of his assistants to Carolina, amid wailing and gnashing of teeth among the faithful. Bowles and company brought in Coen, who, with the aid of some excellent draft choices, built up the running game. Canales and Coen were not lucky stabs in the dark; the organization knows how to get good people, and they will continue to do so. The defense is the next area for improvement, but it is not the shipwreck some claim. Looking at the numbers, the defense was indeed 29 in passing yards per game, but I note that it was ahead of both the Ravens and Lions, who are not called atrocious defenders. This low position was counterbalanced by a run defense that was the fourth best in the league, allowing fewer than 100 yards per game. Overall, the Bucs were 18 in yards and 16 in points, basically a middle-of-the-pack position. That\u2019s not a bad place to be as the starting point for the next step in the rebuild."", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""22nd,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""10:44"", ""am""]}, ""commenter59"": {""username"": ""orlbucfan"", ""post"": ""Not Again Says: January 22nd, 2025 at 7:28 am OrlBucFan and TBBucs3 can\u2019t wait till Coen is gone and they can revel in the genius that is Todd 500 Bowles.
