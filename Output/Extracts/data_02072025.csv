And yes, every concussion is a traumatic brain injury. Goedeke missed four games and returned wearing the Guardian Cap available to NFL players, though few use it. Goedeke’s good buddy Tristan Wirfs, the Bucs’ All-Pro left tackle, opened up about the situation to WDAE radio yesterday in New Orleans. “He was getting like really, really severe headaches at night. Getting like real bad anxiety about it,” Wirfs said of Goedeke. “He wasn’t right yet. … I told him, ‘You gotta be smart, dude. Like this is your brain.’ And he wore the Guardian cap for a while.” Wirfs said Goedeke wasn’t too happy about wearing the Guardian Cap because he knew Wirfs would make fun of him. In typical locker room style, Wirfs said he told Goedeke that sure he’d be made fun of but it’s too important to skip the extra production. “I still love you,” Wirfs said he told Goedeke. This is a good reminder of how things that go on behind the scenes from fans and media. Todd Bowles surely was asked multiple times if Goedeke was close to meeting the NFL’s concussion-return standard. And Bowles just said it was a day-to-day thing. Bowles never said Wirfs was suffering. “[Goedeke] was going through [it] there for a while,” Wirfs said. Joe’s not knocking Bowles, just mentioning how player health is not always as it seems. Regardless, the ending was happy for Goedeke, who had a hell of a season when he returned. “He came and balled out. It was awesome,” Wirfs said.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/chris-godwin-confidence-and-josh-jacobs-recruiting/|Chris Godwin Confidence And Josh Jacobs Recruiting|So listeners to yesterday’s new Ira Kaufman Podcast heard the star of the show say that he left One Buc Palace yesterday with a special feeling. It had nothing to do with morning prunes or tennis elbow. Sage Ira said he departed team headquarters feeling even more confident that pending Bucs free agent receiver Chris Godwin would be on the Bucs’ 2025 roster. Why, Ira? Well, of course, Kaufman wasn’t spilling the entire truth. But Joe can attest to seeing Kaufman speaking to Bucs executives and he mysteriously stepped away early from the private media sitdown chat held with Joe and some local scribes and new Bucs playcaller Josh Grizzard. Odd behavior, and Kaufman wasn’t exiting the building. For many weeks, Kaufman has been saying he expects a return of Godwin barring something unforeseen, like an injury setback or a contender making Godwin a massive offer. So Joe had to take note of the heightened Kaufman confidence. That brings Joe to all the endless chatter out of Green Bay and its hunger for receiver help this offseason. Joe even listened to Packers running back Josh Jacobs talk to SiriusXM NFL Radio at the Pro Bowl and he mentioned recruiting for future teammates in Orlando, and specifically receivers. It’s common thought that the Packers need a true No. 1 receiver, and Godwin has never filled that role in Tampa, plus he’s coming off ankle surgery. So while Joe doesn’t think Green Bay will make a play for Godwin, though Joe won’t sleep 100 percent peacefully until the Bucs settle their receiver position. Between Godwin and fellow pending free agent receiver Sterling Shepard, they hauled in 82 catches last season for 900-plus yards and 6 touchdowns. That’s significant production potentially requiring replacement.|2025-02-07 09:55:00|290|37|8|Chris Godwin|Confidence in Godwin staying with Bucs despite uncertainties elsewhere.|4|Mixed opinions on Godwin's future, emphasizing defense and potential contract terms.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""BrianBucs"", ""post"": ""Godwin\u2019s injury was severe.

Working as a correspondent for FOX Sports, former Bucs quarterback Jameis Winston is all over various Super Bowl festivities in New Orleans and bouncing into shows along radio row. There, he dropped in on the creator, curator and overall guru of Pro Football Talk, the great Mike Florio, along with his co-host Chris Simms, the former Bucs quarterback. Jameis is between jobs. Saquon Barkley advised Jameis to sign with the Giants (from an exposure standpoint, that’s very savvy advice). Florio, hosting his “PFT Live” show, told Jameis there is no question he can play in the league. Florio noted Jameis has a 5,000-yard passing season under his belt. Very, very few quarterbacks have ever hit that plateau. Then Jameis began to reminisce about a lost opportunity. His last year with the Bucs was Arians’ first season in Tampa Bay, when Jameis threw for 5,109 yards passing. Alas, it was a contract year for Jameis. When the Bucs and Tom Brady’s camp were feeling each other out late in the 2019 season, the Bucs made the no-brainer decision to bring in Brady and let Jameis walk. The result? Super Bowl, bay-bee. Boom, boom, BOOM! Jameis wondered out loud to Florio and Simms what may have been if he had a chance to stick around one more year with Arians. Mike Florio: You threw for 5,109 yards out there. There aren’t many human beings in the history of the NFL that have thrown for 5000 yards. That’s something to be proud of. And that, I mean, it’s a rarity. And you did it. Forget the 30 interceptions. You’re in that small quad of 5,000-yard passers. Jameis Winston: I’m grateful for that man. And statistics are things that, you know, I can tell my kids: “Back in the day… .” But my kids wanna see me win. Man, throwing for 5,000 yards is amazing. But we got Mike Evans, Chris Godwin. When you’ve got the pieces that I had around me. Bruce Arians is coming in, allowing me to go all in on my plays. Go all in. Byron Leftwich is calling the best plays in the world. Working with Clyde Christensen. We had the makeup. Obviously, you saw next year they went out and freaking won the Super Bowl with Tom Brady, the best to ever do it. So we had the makeup. Man, I just, I just think if I would have had another year in that system with Bruce, I would have been able to lead my team to that as well. Bruce Arians has often mentioned in interviews that Jameis would have turned things around in a second year with him. And that Jameis not getting that second season is one of his coaching regrets. But let’s not be silly here. Brady came in and raised everyone’s game. Set a new standard. That probably wouldn’t have happened if Jameis stayed. We will never know what would have transpired if the Bucs kept Jameis. But Joe fully understands what did happen when Brady arrived. That season ended with Brady holding the Vince Lombardi Trophy aloft in victory in the humid Tampa night air.  |2025-02-07 08:40:00|535|60|6|Jameis Winston|Jameis regrets not staying another year with Arians.|4|Mixed reactions ranging from support for a new opportunity to criticism of past performance.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""LEWI"", ""post"": ""SO ready for this dude to be an analyst/reporter doing interviews lol"", ""post_time"": [""February"", ""7th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""8:45"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""D-Rome"", ""post"": ""The Bucs were NEVER going to win a Super Bowl with Jameis.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/baker-mayfield-hammers-skinny-margs-buccaneers/|Baker Mayfield “Hammers Skinny Margs”|It’s rather well known that Baker Mayfield and Tristan Wirfs like to hang out at establishments and have a few drinks. But what are these tough guys drinking? Joe has a vision of Boilermaker or Big Bang shots. Maybe some whiskey and Cokes or just a college night of bottled beers. Well, that all seems unlikely after Wirfs’ chat this week with retired Pro Bowl guard/tackle Kyle Long. They sat at a CBS set at the Super Bowl and talked Bucs, which turned to a drinking conversation. Wirfs said it was nice to transition from Tom Brady, a guy he couldn’t have a true relationship with, to Baker Mayfield. Wirfs said when he and Mayfield met, Mayfield asked Wirfs if he wanted to get a beer later that day. A kinship was born. They’re close friends now, but a popular ladies drink seems to have become the go-to for the Bucs’ tone-setters on offense. “He’s a big skinny [margarita] guy,” Wirfs said of Mayfield. “He hammers. He’ll hammer the beers with the boys, but he loves skinny margs. He hammers skinny margs. I don’t know if I’m putting him on blast, but he got me on them.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/how-can-the-bucs-offense-be-better-2/|How Can The Bucs Offense Be Better?|The Bucs in the regular season were third in total offense (399.6 yards a game), fourth in rushing offense (149.2 a game), third in passing (250.4) and fourth in average points scored (29.5). And just by simple osmosis, you figure the Bucs could be better on offense too. Graham Barton, Bucky Irving and Jalen McMillan will no longer be rookies. They’d have a full offseason to work out under the gaze of NFL trainers. Then, if the Bucs re-sign Chris Godwin, this offense is loaded. Still, statistically, how the heck can new offensive coordinator Josh Grizzard improve the Bucs offense much, as he talked about yesterday? To grow into a top-two offense with a first-time play-caller seems wildly optimistic if not unreasonable. So Grizzard, after saying to the local pen and mic club that he is planning to improve, was asked how he could actually do it. Simple, he said. Focus on fundamentals. “What we did on the fundamentals we can now evolve to the next level of the teaching of coverages, of D-line technique, [etc.],” Grizzard said. “That way we can now expand the scheme, continue to add from around the league, add from college [and] continue to put pressure on the defense [as we] try to score points.” In theory, the Bucs could be better on offense as Joe pointed out earlier. But in reality, can that be expected? For example, the offense wasn’t awful with Dave Canales in 2023, but there was no doubt he had growing pains in what was his first season calling plays. It seems natural to expect a step back with a brand new play-caller, even if a team is more talented. If Grizzard can actually improve on what Liam Coen did and help take the Bucs deeper in the playoffs, well, that tells Joe the Bucs will likely be looking for a fifth offensive coordinator in as many years. That would mean that Grizzard is a head coach somewhere this time next year.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/tristan-wirfs-details-whirlwind-of-learning-that-liam-coen-left/|Tristan Wirfs Details “Whirlwind” Of Learning That Liam Coen Left|Roughly two weeks ago, Tristan Wirfs and the rest of his Bucs offensive linemen and Baker Mayfield and their families got away to a tropical location to enjoy the sands and beach and clear waters of the Caribbean and/or the Bahamas. Then those Bucs had their vacation rudely interrupted. They noticed on social media that the Jags wanted to interview former Bucs offensive coordinator Liam Coen. Then Coen pulled out. He was staying. But wait! He’s in Jacksonville. The Bucs couldn’t get a hold of him. Now he’s the Jags head coach? Wirfs and his teammates were monitoring the events as they unfolded at their vacation spot. The Bucs and the Coen drama seemed like a surreal world away even though the updates were coming in fast and furious to their smartphones. “It was kind of crazy,” Wirfs told Ari Meirov of The33rdTeam  from what looked like the Super Bowl media center in New Orleans yesterday. “The whole O-line was together, we went on a little trip. So we are all seeing it, like, break on Twitter, break wherever. “And then we saw [Coen] was back with the Bucs. And then we saw, no, he’s in Jacksonville. And [the Bucs] tried to block something. “It was a whirlwind, really.” And while a lot of Bucs fans are still angry at how Coen left, it seems Coen was standup with his players. Wirfs said he called them on their vacation to fill them in on what was going on and why he took the Jags job. “And then he called us and told us he loves us and appreciates us,” Wirfs said. Wirfs made it clear to Meirov that he doesn’t hold any sort of grudge against Coen. He rhetorically asked how could anyone expect a guy to pass up a chance to reach his dream. “It’s a business,” Wirfs said. “You don’t know when you’re going to get an opportunity like that, to live your dream to be a head coach, is going to come around [again]. “We understood.” Wirfs still shakes his head at how it all went down and how quickly it happened. “Just seeing it [play out], it was like back and forth, back and forth,” Wirfs said. “I wish [Coen] success. Nothing but the best.” Being the standup guy Wirfs is, Joe expects Wirfs is sincere in his words.

Davis, the legendary owner of the Raiders, often liked to brag how he would take the age-old football cliché “Take what the defense gives you” and turn it on its ear, saying “We’ll take what we want.” Grizzard said he wants his offense to attack a defense in a variety of ways, not just run and not just pass. In other words, the Bucs want to take what they want… if they believe a defense is vulnerable to a specific playcall. Still, Grizzard said, he wants to run the ball because if a team can run effectively it rips the heart out of a defense. “At the end of the day, we want to be physical,” Grizzard said. “We want to be physical because the trenches win. When you’re able to run the ball and you’re able to press on a defense for four quarters, that’s what wins ballgames. “We also want to be [multifaceted]. It could be a week where we need to throw the ball more or we need to run the ball more.” Grizzard emphasized that a team cannot be pass-only or run-only. Injuries do and will happen. An offense has to be flexible in order to adjust to injured starters. “Like last year, the guys get hurt and how do you have guys step up?” Grizzard explained. “With the scheme you saw last year, we were able to change plays at the line of scrimmage. … By doing that, we put the pressure on the defense.” Being equal parts dangerous on the ground and in the air keeps defenses guessing, he said, especially in the red zone. And winning in the red zone often leads to victories.
