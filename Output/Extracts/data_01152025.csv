https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/jags-interview-liam-coen/|Jags Interview Liam Coen|So today is the day for the Bucs and offensive coordinator Liam Coen. Coen has only had one bite at the apple of NFL head coaching openings. And that is from the Jags. His first interview is today, per NFL insider Jordan Schultz. @Schultz_Report: Bucs OC Liam Coen is interviewing today with the #Jaguars for their HC opening. He is believed to be a top name to watch in Duval, though their search is still considered early. Man, it would be a kick in the balls to lose Coen. He just turned in one of the best seasons a Bucs offensive coordinator has ever had. And imagine what Coen and the Bucs could do next year. Coen had to break in two new starters on the offensive line and a rookie running back. The rest of the offense, sans Baker Mayfield, had to learn this offense. Just think, with everyone connected to the offense all on the same page, man, this offense could progress in 2025. But Joe has a question for readers: Many want Todd Bowles gone. From what Joe’s heard and been told both in and out of One Buc Palace, Joe is sure Bowles is safe. If Coen leaves, does that make Bowles stronger in his current position with the Bucs or less secure?|2025-01-15 16:07:00|217|75|8|Liam Coen|Liam Coen interviews for Jaguars head coach position.|5|Mixed sentiment about Coen leaving and Bowles' future, with concerns about defensive performance and coach stability.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Tbbucs3"", ""post"": ""Wonder if they asked him why his offense botched 2 handoffs in the 4th quarter of a playoff game?"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""15th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""4:09"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""ocala"", ""post"": ""The Jags will probably make him their new head coach.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/todd-bowles-calijah-kancey-snubbed-for-pro-bowl/|Todd Bowles: Calijah Kancey Snubbed For Pro Bowl|How bout Bucs interior beasts Vita Vea, Calijah Kancey and Logan Hall combining for 20 sacks this season? Impressive stuff, especially with a weak edge rush keeping a lot of attention up the middle. The Bucs even found another 4 sacks from backups at defensive tackle: Will Gholston, Greg Gaines and C.J. Brewer. Twenty-four sacks from that position, heck, that’s more than the entire Bucs team had in 2017. Todd Bowles gushed over his interior unit on the Buccaneers Radio Network. “They’ve been huge all year. I mean, Kancey, Vita, Logan, obviously Gaines, Will, all those guys have been huge all year. They penetrate up the middle,” Bowles said. “Kancey’s really been unbelievable. Vita went to the Pro Bowl; Kancey should have been there as well. And I thought Logan had an excellent year making the jump from last year in the run game and the pass game. And those three guys are pretty much three of the top four guys in sacks on our team. So, they really carried us and they had a heck of a year.” Kancey led the Bucs with 7 1/2 sacks in just 12 games. Vea had 7 sacks and Hall shocked the world with 5 1/2. Kancey’s 11 tackles for loss ranked top-30 in the NFL. Again, he missed the first five games with a calf injury. Joe is a huge Kancey fan. If he could manage to play a full season, damn. Of course, it will be a long offseason for Kancey as he thinks about running with Jayden Daniels’ white towel in his right hand instead of tackling the rookie QB for a loss late in fourth quarter. Joe can’t shake the image. Daniels stiff-armed Kancey in the backfield and ran for a first down on 3rd-and-2. If Kancey made that play, the Bucs get the ball back with 40 seconds left after Washington’s potential go-ahead field goal on the next snap — with a chance to win or tie.|2025-01-15 11:08:00|329|33|8|Calijah Kancey|Impressive season for Bucs' interior defensive line unit.|5|Comments vary from optimistic to pessimistic, highlighting player potential and performance concerns.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""SlyPirate"", ""post"": ""CK to the Pro Bowl?

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/he-got-a-bad-rap-up-there/|“He Got A Bad Rap Up There”|So how much will Bucs left guard Ben Bredeson earn when his contract expires in two months. Will it be $8 million per year? $10 million? More? Bredeson turns 27 next month and is coming off an injury-free year that saw him be a key cog in a punishing Bucs running game and a strong offensive line. As an inexpensive 2024 free agent signing by Buccaneers Ring of Honor general manager Jason Licht, Bredeson has to get at least an “A-” grade. While Joe knows the Bucs won’t go crazy with Team Glazer loot for Bredeson, they certainly want him back to return their beastly young offensive line intact next season. Head coach Todd Bowles gushed over his left guard on the Buccaneers Radio Network. “He brought toughness, consistency. Coming in from the Giants, you know, he got a bad rap up there,” Bowles said. “But he came in, he held down the left guard spot for us. Had a heck of a year. Fit right in with the guys. The chemistry those guys had along with the leadership he brought in was unbelievable.” Bredeson has always intrigued Joe because of his interesting background. A a fourth-round pick in the 2020 NFL Draft, Bredeson was one of a whopping 10 University fo Michigan players drafted that year including four offensive linemen. In Round 1, the Saints grabbed center/guard Cesar Ruiz. He signed a massive contract extension in 2023. After Bredeson went to the Ravens in Round 4, Michigan guard Michael Onwenu went off the board in Round 6 to New England. He signed a super fat three-year contract extension. Ten picks later in Round 6, a Michigan offensive tackle went off the board, John Runyan, Jr. The Packers moved him to guard and the dude didn’t miss a start and played very well. He got a huge multiyear deal in 2024 free agency. Bredeson is about to join his brothers in wealth.|2025-01-15 10:19:00|322|34|8|Ben Bredeson|Left guard's successful season and future contract expectations.|5|Mixed opinions on Bredeson's value and future with the team.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/looking-at-corner/|Looking At Corner?|Joe really tries to wait to jump into the draft pool until after free agency. That doesn’t mean Joe won’t monitor the draft — shoot, Joe will be at the combine in six weeks. Draft coverage really fries Joe’s brain so Joe doesn’t dive in until after free agency in March. Often, by the time the draft rolls around, the burnout is so bad Joe can barely make it through the day. But, how bout a little draft talk while it seems most of Bucs fandom is sour at Todd Bowles. Joe thinks the Bucs, picking at No. 19, need an inside linebacker in the worst way. Don’t ask Joe which one. There is a very real chance both Lavonte David and K.J. Britt are not here in a few weeks. So the Bucs have a hole bigger there than what Tristan Wirfs can create. Over at the PFF tribe, they seem to think cornerback is the way to go. Jordan Plocher and Josh Liskiewitz of the PFF tribe think Notre Dame corner Benjamin Morrison is a savvy pick. Tampa Bay Buccaneers: CB Benjamin Morrison, Notre Dame Jamel Dean has been consistently good in coverage but will be heading into his seventh season in 2025. The freakishly athletic Zyon McCollum showed improvement in his third season, but you can never have enough talented cornerbacks. Benjamin Morrison played both out wide and in the slot at Notre Dame. Morrison was primarily in a man coverage role in college and that man coverage experience will help him as he transitions to the NFL. The Buccaneers won’t ask Morrison to play man coverage as much as he did at Notre Dame, as the Buccaneers used man coverage on 18.8% of snaps in the 2024 regular season. After man coverage, Morrison played the deep-third more than he did any other coverage role at Notre Dame, and the Buccaneers ran Cover 3 on 43.5% of pass plays in 2024. Morrison’s proven ability to play the deep-third in Cover 3 as well as sticky man coverage makes him a great match for the Buccaneers schematically and adds to their secondary depth. While Joe knows the Bucs need to load up on inside linebackers — don’t get Joe started about outside linebackers — a good corner isn’t a dumb call. Joe is at the end of his rope with Jamel Dean. Dean isn’t a bad player, but man, this guy is beyond brittle. Dean could be Deion Sanders but if he can’t stay on the field, he is of no use. The last two playoff games Dean had game-ending injuries. In the 2022 season playoff game, Dean rode the bench injured and Sean Murphy-Bunting started in his place. This season, he missed the most games of his career with various ailments. Dean may be a decent to good corner, but he can’t be trusted any longer to answer the bell. The Bucs must have a quality corner ready to go when Dean gets hurt — and he will get hurt. Joe would have loved to see what Morrison would have done against Ohio State’s monsters at receiver, but alas he’s out with a hip injury and reportedly needs surgery. So maybe that pushes him out of the first round? Regardless, corner is a position the Bucs need to focus on (along with inside linebacker) for the aforementioned reasons.|2025-01-15 10:00:00|561|52|4|Joe|Joe debates focusing on inside linebacker or cornerback in draft.|3|Mixed sentiments about team personnel, coaching, draft picks, and player performance in comments.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""WiscoJoe"", ""post"": ""I think he\u2019s out for the season with a hip injury."", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""15th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""10:13"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""stpetebucsfan"", ""post"": ""Amen!"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""15th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""10:20"", ""am""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""gofortheface30"", ""post"": ""One of two All Americans Notre Dame is missing on Defense and was a projected top 15 pick before the season.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/any-staff-changes-coming-todd-bowles-didnt-exactly-say-no/|Staff Changes Coming? Todd Bowles Didn’t Exactly Say No.|One could argue some new coaching voices are needed on the defensive side of the ball. Joe knows a lot of fans want a new defensive coordinator. Two straight seasons of dreadful pass defense support that assertion. Todd Bowles was asked about staff changes at his season-ending news conference on Monday. He sure didn’t show a rousing sense of distaste against such moves. “Not thinking about that right now,” Bowles said. “Again, we’re having exit interviews – we’re fresh off the loss. As the days come, we’ll go from there.” Was that a flat out “no” to you? Bowles has had no issue making staff changes on offense. Defensively? Bowles largely has been loyal to his staff. Maybe too loyal? He did defend his defensive assistants without giving them a full vote of confidence. “We went to the playoffs five times with the defensive coaches we have,” Bowles said. “They’re very good coaches, obviously. “A lot of things have to happen in that … We’ve got to get more interceptions, we’ve got to coach it better, but we’ve got to play it better, as well.” “Coach it better” has been a common phrase used by Bowles. His staff had at least a full season and offseason offseason to correct the fourth-worst defense in passing yards allowed per game. If his coaches are “very good,” then why no improvement? If you went to any defensive coach and asked, “Hey, I can give you two stud defensive tackles, three edge guys picked in the first three rounds, a borderline Hall of Fame inside linebacker, an All-Pro safety, one corner who just had 17 pass breakups and another young corner who started for a Super Bowl winner, can you work with that?” The coach would probably run you over in order to sign a contract. Joe knows this. Whatever Bowles and his staff are doing with that pass defense, it ain’t working. Whatever they are saying isn’t sinking in. Bowles needs to do a full and complete defensive evaluation of what’s gone wrong — from the coaching in underwear football to calls made during December games to the lack of execution.|2025-01-15 06:00:00|358|61|4|Todd Bowles|Potential staff changes questioned for pass defense performance.|2|Fans express frustration with coaching staff, lack of changes, and performance deficiencies.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Ted"", ""post"": ""Wink Martindale is looking to return to the NFL\u2026..he would be a huge upgrade to the Bucs staff.

That was the message from a very angry-sounding Jon Gruden in an epic rant after Tampa Bay lost to the Commanders on Sunday. The Super Bowl-winning former Bucs head coach joined the Barstool Sports “Shred Line” to react to the Bucs’ falling in Round 1 of the playoffs. Chucky was no fan of center Graham Barton’s choke job, the critical Baker Mayfield-Jalen McMillan fumble mess and what he said was playcaller Liam Coen or Mayfield getting too cute. “I am just disgusted. Failing to hand the ball off on your own 12 yard line; you deserve to lose,” Gruden began. “And then it’s 3rd-and-1, you try to get tricky with some kind of hard count; you lose yards and it costs you another four points. … We let that game go. We just gave it away. …We knew [the Bucs] had to score more than 20 points. I mean, you’re not going to win scoring 20 points. We had two fourth-down stops, the Buccaneer defense did. The Bucs defense did what they had to do to win the football game. “You gotta be able to hand it off. Is it that hard? Could you get under the center and hand the freakin’ ball off? Can you snap it on a hard count or on 1 at this point in the season? Is that what we’re talking about? I would be sick losing a game for those two reasons right there. And I know Buccaneer fans are sick.” Coach is right.

I really think Gruden would have let some players have it (verbally) after the game, which is how you lose your team.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/verdict-fumbled-jet-sweep-was-not-a-bad-playcall/|Verdict: Fumbled Jet Sweep Was Not A Bad Playcall|Some Bucs fans are grumbling (well, maybe more than grumbling) saying no way Bucs offensive coordinator Liam Coen should ever have called a jet sweep with the ball on the Bucs-15 on Sunday night. Joe cannot go there, especially after watching the All-22 film. The Bucs led 17-13 early in the fourth quarter. The Bucs had just stopped the Commandos on the Bucs-3 forcing a change of possession after the Commandos failed on a fourth-down pass for a touchdown. After a throw from Baker Mayfield to Mike Evans for a first down, Coen called a jet sweep to Jalen McMillan. The handoff was fumbled. Mayfield, in his postgame press conference, took a bullet and said it was his fault. McMillan said he and Mayfield weren’t on the same page. Cris Collinsworth fingered Mayfield for the error. When the fumble occurred, there were no defenders outside the numbers from the All-22 angle. There was one Commandos defender, barely outside the numbers a split second after the fumble. That was Marshon Lattimore, who was engaged with receiver Rakim Jarrett. Neither player yet knew a fumble happened. Commandos corner Noah Igbinoghene was inside the numbers and Sterling Shepard was headed straight for him. Igbinoghene darted back inside and away from Shepard when he realized the handoff was fumbled. If Shepard and/or Jarrett couldn’t maintain their blocks, McMillan, had he gotten a clean handoff, would have had maybe a five-yard gain. Had both Shepard and Jarrett maintained their blocks, McMillan would have had a monster gain, maybe busted loose to get the Bucs into field goal range or better. (If the video below doesn’t work, click here.) It could have been a huge play. Preferably, a sweep is called for the ball carrier to have the ball with some green grass in front of him. That’s what this play would have been if not for the fumble. So Joe can’t wag a finger at Coen. The Commandos clearly weren’t ready for the sweep call and it had big-play potential. If there wasn’t a fumble. If anything, Joe applauds Coen for the call. People whine about Todd Bowles being too conservative all the time. So the offensive coordinator calling for a jet sweep (when it would have produced yards) shouldn’t be ridiculed.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/trey-palmer-praised-for-overlooked-skill/|Trey Palmer Praised For Overlooked Skill|Joe doesn’t have a great answer for why Trey Palmer went from 39 catches as a rookie to just 12 this season. The Bucs planned/hoped/expected to use him more. Heck, Palmer only got 5 targets through the final seven games, including Sunday night’s playoff loss. Back in August, Bucs officials openly talked about getting him the ball to utilize his great speed. Joe speculated that Palmer had playbook issues on opening day (he looked lost at times) and that might have cost him some trust from new offensive coordinator Liam Coen. But Palmer appeared to rebound a few weeks later before disappearing again in the offense. Regardless, the 23-year-old found some love from his head coach this week on the Buccaneers Radio Network. Todd Bowles praised the development of his backup receivers and started with Palmer. “A lot of growth [among backup receivers], I thought Trey was one of our better blockers,” Bowles said. “With all the speed, everybody thinks he’s just a downfield guy, but he’s one of our better blockers, [one of] the most aggressive guys.” Being a strong blocker as a backup receiver is a great way to stay employed on a run-heavy team like the Bucs. So Joe thinks Palmer’s Bucs days aren’t finished. Bowles praised fellow receiver Ryan Miller as a “do-everything” guy, and he called out Rakim Jarrett for great toughness. He did not mention Sterling Shepard.|2025-01-15 03:42:00|233|12|4|Trey Palmer|Trey Palmer's struggle and praise for his blocking skills.|2|Negative comments outweigh positive ones, criticizing player performance and skills.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Senor Harry in Costa Rica"", ""post"": ""We wish he was the second coming of Michael Clayton"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""15th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""6:19"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""BucU"", ""post"": ""A lot of growth Todd?

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/as-the-smoke-clears-on-the-bucs-season/|As The Smoke Clears On The Bucs’ Season|Before the season, if Bucs fans knew the Bucs would win 10 games, nearly all would raise a glass and toast head coach Todd Bowles. Well, he did that. And many of those same Bucs fans now want his head on a platter. (Cue Rodney Dangerfield.) Joe thinks he knows why there is so much anger at Bowles. Of course, the winnable game against the Commandos was not won, ending the season. Big issue there. And the Bucs likely p!ssed away two or three other wins that may have given the Bucs a more favorable opponent than the Commandos. The galling choke job at Atlanta (where the defense was flamebroiled for over 500 pass yards by a guy just weeks from getting benched), a botched decision to play for overtime on the road against an assassin of a Hall of Fame quarterback, and not looking prepared at all against a very beatable Dallas team where the immortal Cooper Rush nearly killed the Bucs’ playoff dreams. And yes, Joe understands some fans still have an ax to grind with Bowles over Cooper Kupp, even though that was three seasons ago and before Bowles was even the team’s head coach. Not-so-closet Eagles fan Ben Solak of BSPN can feel the rage of Bucs fans all the way from Philadelphia. … the fan base remains frustrated with head coach Todd Bowles, who has been shaky as a game manager and whose defense was the author of many of the Buccaneers’ losses this season. Meanwhile, offensive coordinator Liam Coen has already taken one head coaching interview with the Jaguars, and he might take more now that Tampa Bay is out of the playoffs. I don’t imagine there will be an immediate shakeup of the coaching staff, but if the Buccaneers enter next season with Bowles and no Coen, it’s reasonable to expect that their offense takes a step back while their defense continues to struggle. Even the NFC South might be more challenging to win next season. Well, Bowles is coming back. So a new coach is not an option here. This year. However, it may be time for a shakeup on the defensive staff. Look, Joe’s not trying to get anyone run, but let’s be real: The NFL is a results-oriented business and the Bucs’ pass defense is not getting the desired results. Not even close. For two straight years, the pass defense has allowed the fourth-worst yards per game. That’s two straight years. And that’s even with an All-Pro safety, a corner who had 17 pass breakups (third in the NFL) and another veteran safety who the Bucs brought back in free agency. (In the wild card round of the playoffs, the Bucs allowed the most passing yards of any playoff team. And that happened playing at home against a rookie quarterback.) Additionally, you had a borderline Hall of Fame inside linebacker and two really good first-round picks at defensive tackles. And fourth-worst passing yards allowed per game is the best you can do? Two straight years? Even a blind person can see there is something wrong. Two years ago, the five worst teams in passing yards allowed per game since have changed up their defensive coaching staff, either with new head coaches or new coordinators. Every team but the Bucs (so far). All four improved to no worse than 20th against the pass. So either the Bucs need to load up on more talent, though they have proven talent on every level of the defense, or the Bucs need some new voices on the defense. Same ol,’ same ol’ isn’t going to cut it. And maybe, just maybe, the Bucs might have to break down and go out and find a proven pass rusher. Bringing Bucs sacks king Shaq Barrett out of mothballs or signing a dude who can’t put the bong down is pretty much a waste of time and Team Glazer loot.|2025-01-15 00:00:00|653|48|2|Todd Bowles|Bucs fans frustrated with Todd Bowles' coaching decisions.|1|Comments range from frustration with coaching to reminiscing about team history and players.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Derek"", ""post"": ""If the Bucs have to choose between Coen potentially taking a HC job and Bowles, they will have Bowles walk the plank."", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""15th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""12:03"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""AJ"", ""post"": ""@Joe"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""15th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""12:24"", ""am""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""Capt Ahab"", ""post"": ""Yes, A decent season is better then a terrible season.
