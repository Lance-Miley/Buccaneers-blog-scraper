https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/crunch-time-for-the-mike-evans-streak/|Crunch Time For The Mike Evans Streak|To the best of Joe’s knowledge, Mike Evans didn’t look happy walking off the field last Sunday in Tampa and didn’t talk to reporters after the game.  Also, to the best of Joe’s knowledge, Evans didn’t chat with media this past week. Odd. But Joe is not making assumptions. There could be all kinds of reasons. However, Joe wonders how Evans feels about getting only five targets Sunday against the Raiders while the Bucs offense struggled for long stretches. Evans’ streak of 10 consecutive seasons with 1,000 yards or more receiving hangs in the balance. The future Hall of Fame receiver has 43 catches this season for 590 yards and 7 touchdowns. And there are only four games remaing on the schedule. Extending Evans’ streak of 1,000-yard seasons to 11 years would tie the NFL record held by Jerry Rice. It’s important to Evans. It’s important to Baker Mayfield. It’s important to fans. And it’s important to the power hitters at One Buc Palace. So what are the Bucs going to do about it? A low output game for Evans against the Chargers’ stout pass defense tomorrow would supremely hurt his chances of extending the streak. Whatever happens against the Chargers, Evans’ targets total needs to hit 10. Joe believes. Evans’ 5 targets against the Raiders was a thoroughly unacceptable total for any game in which Evans plays four quarters. Put the ball in the hands of your best players. It’s hard to go wrong doing that. With Baker Mayfield at quarterback, the Bucs have a 6-4 record (including playoffs) when Evans gets 10 or more targets. Joe really doesn’t want to be writing an obituary on the Evans streak later this month. That would be a sad, sad day.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/split-chargers-bucs-picks-at-joebucsfan-com-world-headquarters/|Split Chargers-Bucs Picks At JoeBucsFan.com World Headquarters|Thankfully, the Zephyrhills water delivery guy Friday at JoeBucsFan.com world headquarters broke up the near fistfight that broke out. Lots of arguing this week about Sunday’s Bucs-Chargers game between Ira Kaufman, Joe, the other Joe and the team of Gen Z interns. Kaufman declared a Bucs victory in Los Angeles. “I don’t care that they’re going cross country,” Kaufman said of Tampa Bay. “Mike Evans has to step up this week. He’s feeling good. Get him the ball. … And take a couple of shots downfield, Mr. Coen. Will you do it? “… The Charger offense does not scare me, so that removes the biggest concern about the Bucs, which is their defense. … I’m going with the Bucs, 20-16.” Joe stepped up and picked the Bucs to win 24-21 with a late field goal. All those tough losses and experience in close games will make a difference for the Bucs and “finally pays off,” Joe said, and expect the loss of running back J.K. Dobbins to be a killer for the L.A. offense. However, the “other Joe” was having none of that noise because the Bucs’ pass defense is terribly decimated and was struggling before all their new injuries. Look for a solid Chargers win 21-17, “other Joe” said, claiming the Bucs’ winning streak ends now facing a high-quality quarterback and question marks surrouding Bucky Irving’s hip/back issue, the Bucs’ fill-in safeties and Baker Mayfield’s healing leg. Tomorrow, Joe will run the usual gameday poll asking Bucs fans who will win the game. Joe suspects it’ll be a fanbase divided there, too.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/the-soft-nfl/|The Soft NFL|Roger Goodell’s league is so soft that if two dudes had a pillow fight at midfield, Goodell may have a coronary. The NFL announced fines for players today for actions that happened in last week’s games. Many of the plays where the league got its panties in a wad were never flagged for a penalty. In other words, NFL officials scour gametape for reasons to get triggered. In studying the tape of the Bucs’ win over the Raiders last week, a run by Rachaad White was deemed too hard. Yes, a running back hitting a defender who is trying to end his season is deemed a culprit. Thankfully, White was not fined for his Angry Run when he stiff-armed Decamerion Richardson onto Dale Mabry Highway. That would have been something. Win Kyle Brandt’s Angry Runs award and get fined days later. Joe has the offending play below. The NFL got triggered because White lowered his head (to protect himself?) on a run where White ran over Raiders safety Tre’von Moehrig. For this heinous offense, White is now $45,020 lighter in the wallet. Someone at the NFL is going to have to explain to Joe how this helps grow the game.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/will-deep-shot-fears-doom-tampa-bay/|Will Deep-Shot Fears Doom Tampa Bay?|A standout defensive coordinator in NFL history once issued advice to a Buccaneers’ playcaller and head coach, and it stuck. The advice was simple: “Throw deep.” The order was given to Dirk Koetter decades ago by Marvin Lewis, the architect of the Ravens’ iconic defense from 1996-2001 and the former Bengals head coach. Lewis kept it simple. Throwing deep terrorizes defense and offenses don’t do it enough. Enter Todd Bowles. Those who scrutinize the Bucs pass defense know it’s a unit obsessed with not getting beat deep. Bowles’ defensive backs generally do a great job with that — while decent quarterbacks carve them up short to a too-often painful degree. Now enter Bucs offensive coordinator Liam Coen. He’s largely pulled the plug on the Bucs taking deep shots this season. Hey, it’s working well, but for how long? Joe thinks it’s ironic that Bowles is so dialed into his defense not being beaten by long throws as his playcaller feels no urge to throw deep. Tomorrow against the Chargers (8-5), the Bucs (7-6) will face a team severely lacking deep-threat weapons. QB Justin Herbert has just five completions of 40 or more yards this season after only four last year. Does that mean Bowles will tighten his soft zone and not worry about the long ball? Will Coen test the Chargers’ elite pass defense that surely won’t be looking for Mike Evans or Trey Palmer to run a go route? Joe has a sneaky feeling that a deep ball will be the key play in tomorrow’s game.

I\u2019m all about having an ultra aggressive downfield offense \u2013 it\u2019s why I loved Winston, he was a great fit for that, didn\u2019t care if he threw an INT 45 yards down the field on 3rd and 12 \u2013 but Baker isn\u2019t that guy. Baker is very good at moving in the pocket, keeping plays alive and making short accurate throws. But Bakers accuracy goes to hell once you get past 10 yards or so down the field. He\u2019s got plenty of arm, so I don\u2019t know what the issue is, but we have a very large sample size at this point. Doesn\u2019t of course mean Baker can\u2019t make any of those throws, he\u2019s accurate at times, but it\u2019s just not something you should bank on. With that said, of course you should still take a few shots just to keep the defense honest. Obviously Mike should be the main target, but even a scrub like Palmer should get a look or two a game on a fly route.

In fact, coming from Munch it is really ironic since he was the prime basher  of OT Skule not providing adequate pass protection.  Tampa hasn\u2019t been able to throw deep because 1) haven\u2019t had a deep threat most of season with hamstring problems for ME13 and 2) the O line has not provided enough time for Baker to even look deep. The O line is progressing nicely and with ME healing hopefully Baker will get a chance to show off the long ball between now and the end of season.  The last time Mayfield played on a team committed to the long ball was 2020 and he ranked 6 in long passing. For comparison sake Aaron Rodgers was ranked 4 in 2020. It is really interesting to read, again, the smug assurances with which these amateur NFL analysts pass off as insight.  Can\u2019t wait for Baker to once again prove the negative chorus wrong.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/bspn-bucky-irving-trending-up/|BSPN: Bucky Irving “Trending” Up|Yesterday, Bucs coach Todd Bowles was non-committal regarding the status of star running back Bucky Irving. A well-plugged-in national NFL scribe is more direct. Jeremy Fowler of BSPN typed this morning that Irving is “trending” up to play Sunday in the City of Angels against the Chargers. Now yesterday Bowles said Irving was a “gametime” decision with his bad hip and back, meaning Irving will sort of get a test drive on the turf of SoFi Stadium before the Bucs give him a thumbs-up or a thumbs-down. In Joe’s mind, this game is sort of under the radar. If the Bucs can pull off the upset and the Raiders rise from the ashes, it would take a collapse by Tampa Bay to choke away the division title that also brings a home playoff game.|2024-12-14 12:50:00|134|18|5|Bucky Irving|Star RB Irving may play despite uncertainty.|5|Mixed opinions on resting or playing him, emphasizing the importance of upcoming games and playoffs.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""A Bucs Fan"", ""post"": ""Sit him down and play next week,"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""14th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""12:55"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Drunk Bucs Fan"", ""post"": ""Desmond Ridder has the chance to do the funniest thing in the NFL this season\u2026.."", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""14th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""1:25"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""ModHairKen"", ""post"": ""Let him sit!

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/time-sucking-todd-bowles/|Time-Sucking Todd Bowles|So a couple of ex-Bucs coaches are chiming in on Sunday’s Bucs-Chargers game.  Joe’s referring to former Bucs center and 2021 Bucs assistant offensive line coach A.Q. Shipley and Jay Gruden, a Bucs assistant before his head coaching gig with the Redskins (2014-2019). They host a YouTube show on the Clean Pocket channel with longtime Giants offensive lineman Justin Pugh and retired QB Colt McCoy. The discussion turned to preparing to face defenses late in a season and Gruden explained that Todd Bowles teams are nightmares at that time of year. He said an offensive staff might need five hours just to study all the Bowles blitzes, nickel blitzes and odd fronts. Gruden called it “very time consuming” and noted that while Bowles demands an offense be creative, it can distract an offense from focusing on what they do best. Now Joe thought Gruden might be exaggerating (he’s prone to that), but Shipley chimed in and agreed. He noted how in his one year of coaching the Bucs, he realized the chess match for offensive coaches can be overhwhelming late in a season against teams with diverse defenses. And few teams have as many defensive nuances as the Bucs’ do. Hmmmm, could this be a reason Bowles teams seem to thrive late in a year? Gruden is convinced the Bucs want a “physical, bloodbath matchup” on offense to limit the dropback passes for Baker Mayfield with beastly edge rushers Khalil Mack and Joey Bosa lurking. Gruden picked the Bucs to beat the Chargers, if Mayfield can protect the football and the Bucs can spit out just enough run defense. Pugh thinks the Bucs will win, in part because they don’t have to overthink their offense. Running the ball, using Mike Evans and smart scrambling by Mayfield should be enough to topple a weak Chargers offense, he said. It wasn’t all flowers for the Bucs. Colt McCoy picked the Chargers because he’s studied the Bucs pass defense. “I think you’ll see more from Herbert and the skill guys,” he said. And Shipley, a huge Bucs fan and supporter, also thinks the Bucs’ pass defense will be just want the Chargers need to eat a “W.” What are the predictions of Joe and Ira Kaufman for Sunday’s game? It’s a split decision that comes starting at the 33:30 mark of this weekend’s Ira Kaufman Podcast below or on the home page.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/bucs-at-chargers-tv-map/|Bucs At Chargers, TV Map|The Bucs travel to the City of Angels today to face the Chargers tomorrow. And thanks to the power of the Steelers, few folks outside the Tampa Bay TV market will get to watch the game free.  The Steelers, along with the Cowboys, Chiefs and Packers, are true national teams. They get the eyeballs. Lots of them. And really, that’s all TV network suits care about. So Bucs fans get the shaft. While most of Florida will get the Bucs-Chargers game on free TV via their local FOX affiliate, the only other regions are Atlanta, southern California and Eugene, Ore. Just guesses Eugene is full of Chargers fans because of Justin Herbert. This is about as wide of a brownout of a Bucs late-window broadcast as you will see. This is Lost Decade-level. Adam Amin, Mark Sanchez and Kristina Pink will handle the call on the 4:25 p.m. kickoff. So, if you don’t live in one of the four regions, it’s off to your neighborhood sports bar or time for Sunday Ticket. Of course, Joe always encourages fans to hit up their neighborhood Hooters for cold beer, hot wings and the legendary Hooters girls. Oh yeah, and football on the flatscreens, too.

Bucs coach Todd Bowles said the team won’t know until the rookie warms up prior to the game against the Chargers in Los Angeles. So Joe understands why Bucs AC/DC-loving general manager Jason Licht seemed rather coy with popular national sports TV and radio personality Adam Schein when Licht appeared Wednesday on “Schein on Sports,” heard on “Mad Dog Radio” exclusively on SiriusXM. There, Schein asked Licht if Irving could play and admitted he’s concerned about Irving being a little guy and with potential endurance issues. “We’re doing everything we can to get him ready,” Licht said. “He didn’t really have a setback [against the Raiders]. “Just his back tightened up and [Bucs trainers and coaches] saw he wasn’t himself down on the field. They just wanted to shelter him a little bit. Get him off the field.” Irving had a catch and run for 15 yards and carried the ball four times for three yards before the Bucs shut him down. Still, the Bucs ran for 152 yards. “We’re fortunate we’ve got Rachaad White and Sean Tucker on our roster as well who are outstanding players, too,” Licht said. “We need all three of them to make this run.” Licht made no secret of his belief that Irving was just the shot in the arm the Bucs’ run game needed when he was drafted. “Bucky has been a breath of fresh air for this organization,” Licht said. “His attitude, his professionalism. He meets with [Bucs senior offensive assistant] Tom Moore every day at 5 a.m. for like 10 minutes. “He just can’t wait to get to work every day.” Despite having a troubled upbringing, Licht said (Irving’s father died when he was a toddler and a brother was shot and killed when he was in high school), Irving exudes a contagious positive attitude in the running backs room. “He didn’t grow up in a great house like most of us did,” Licht said. “And he still has a great outlook on life. “He’s going to be a true pro for the rest of his career. I’m excited about his future.” The numbers say it all. When Irving got more carries early in the season, the Bucs offense and the run game started to take off.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/362823/|Tykee Smith, Rookies And A Depleted Safety Position|Is Tykee Smith still a rookie? Well, by the strict definition, yes. With most football coaches, including Bucs coach Todd Bowles, no. Coaches often consider rookies to be veterans late in a season. The reasoning is, the rookie has seen enough that little should surprise him, if he’s been playing a lot. Joe asked Bowles about that this week and Bowles believes if a player shows enough savvy and smarts, he’s no longer a rookie in the summer. “We try to make that saying in August,” Bowles said on Wednesday when Joe asked him about Jalen McMillan seemingly turning the corner. “Once you have your first meetings and first day of practice, you’re no longer a rookie.” But with nickel corner Tykee Smith, Bowles seems to be treating the rookie like, well, a rookie. With so many safeties hurt and not expected to play Sunday, Bowles was asked if he may flip Smith, normally a nickel corner, between safety and corner in Los Angeles against the Chargers. Bowles did a little bit of that against the Raiders. Bowles didn’t seem to favor that as he said that may be too much for the rookie. “It’s probably too much to put on his plate right now, as a rookie,” Bowles said. “.We try to give him what he can handle but I think he’s a good football player and, if needed, he can go back there.” So much for becoming a seasoned veteran in August.
