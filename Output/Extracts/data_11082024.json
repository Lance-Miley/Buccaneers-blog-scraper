It’s damn impressive.Others have a different view. Take ex-Bucs quarterback Chris Simms, the NBC analyst. He’s a fan of Tampa Bay and loves how the Bucs have turned Cade Otton into their top option and found ways to thrive throwing to running backs.But Simms thinks the success will be fleeting.“Teams are going to start to catch on and slow that down and it’s going to make it tough sledding for the Buccaneers,” Simms said on Pro Football Talk.Then Simms let his frustration show.“It stinks,” he said. “The Buccaneers are a playoff team but I don’t know if they can survive these injuries and where they are in this stretch of the schedule right now.”As for Sunday against the 49ers (4-4), Simms talked about how he considered that the Bucs (4-5) might get blown out in Tampa. But Simms, who is close friends with Niners head coach Kyle Shanahan and follows the team closely, said he released that thought because San Francisco has been too inconsistent.“They find ways to let teams stay in a game too often,” he said.Joe will disagree with Simms that the NFL is going to catch up to the Bucs’ re-worked offense.If you have a smart playcaller, a strong offensive line, a Pro Bowl quarterback and solid skill players, NFL defenses shouldn’t figure you out.The Bucs have all those things.", "post_time": "2024-11-08T18:29:23+00:00", "word_count": 240, "number_of_comments": 40, "article_sentiment_score": "7", "article_subject": "Joe", "article_summary": "Bucs offense thriving but concerns about teams catching on.", "responses": {"commenter0": {"username": "FlBoy84", "post": "It’s only natural D’s will start to see patterns and make adjustments, but do feel Simms is overlooking the intelligence of Coen & Co and their ability to adjust as well.

I want a coin toss and my quarterback who has over 400 yards in a coin flip to start OT instead. It’s annoying with all the MISCONCEPTION that you go for 2. Sabremetics at their simplest form does not apply to that situation.  There is Way too many factors. That last drive the Ravens forced the Bengals to work for every yard down to 4th down. They didn’t steam roll into the end zone. The best play would in my opinion would be go to a coin flip for OT because of the games variables.

He praised Coen for doing a job that might be historic.“I don’t know if I’ve ever seen anybody averaging close to 30 points a game in a first-year takeover — in a new offense,” Arians said. “So it’s a credit to the guys buying in.”Joe just started the process of researching the performances of new NFL playcallers and first-year takeovers with a new offense. But is a little leery. Documenting Coen’s special season might help Coen move on after this season. And Joe wants no part of that.Late in the 2015 season, Joe researched then-playcaller Dirk Koetter achieving the super-rare feat of leading a top-10 offense for three different NFL franchises.Making that news public prompted a call from Koetter’s agent to Joe, which led to Joe learning about Koetter’s quest for a head coaching job.

The Bucs’ have the latter to close the 2024 season. Retired Pro Bowl quarterback Alex Smith was on SiriusXM NFL Radio today talking with his co-host about how the Bucs play “five of their last eight [games] against 2-win football teams.”It’s a stunning reality.And it’s why Smith thinks the Bucs (4-5) are a likely playoff team, he said, especially if Tampa Bay can find a “W” at home Sunday against the 49ers before the Bucs’ bye week.Like every former QB with working eyes, Smith sees Baker Mayfield playing very well and a Bucs team with enough offense to knock off the NFL’s basement clubs routinely, especially with Mike Evans slated to return.Consider that the Bucs’ final three games are against the sinking Cowboys (3-5), with Dak Prescott now facing hamstring surgery, the slimy Saints (2-7) in tanking mode, and the Panthers (2-7).What a cupcake finish!Before that, it’s the two-win Giants. They rank last in the NFL in scoring at 15.4 points per game. Also on the schedule is the two-win Raiders, another game against the Panthers, and a trip to visit a tough Chargers team.To make the scene more fun, the Raiders come to Tampa in December for a 1 p.m. game following a trip to Kansas City. That’s a bad combination for a west coast team. Bucco Bruce Arians himself was on Barstool Gambling last week talking about how players on bad teams routinely check out around Thanksgiving.If the Bucs stay relatively healthy and can’t find six more wins on their schedule, then the Bucs’ coaching staff will deserve the blinding spotlight that will descend upon it.Ira Kaufman Talks Fan Disenchantment, The 2-Point Saga, Expectations, Liam Coen, And More\n", "post_time": "2024-11-08T00:49:40+00:00", "word_count": 291, "number_of_comments": 26, "article_sentiment_score": "8", "article_subject": "Buccaneers", "article_summary": "Favorable outlook on Bucs' easy schedule for potential playoff run.", "responses": {"commenter0": {"username": "Buchen61", "post": "Todd woll find a way to f it up", "post_time": "November 7th, 2024 at 8:11 pm"}, "commenter1": {"username": "Buccaneer Bonzai", "post": "This is why I said the other day that we could win maybe 4-5 more games.", "post_time": "Buccaneer Bonzai"}, "commenter2": {"username": "Dave Pear", "post": "Great.
