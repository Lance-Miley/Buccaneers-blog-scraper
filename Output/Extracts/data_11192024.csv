https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/11/theyre-checking-out-at-thanksgiving/|“They’re Checking Out At Thanksgiving”|The remaining Bucs opponents have a combined record of 24-47.But facing a team during the holiday season is about more than just its record. Players on losing clubs aren’t always giving their best late in a lost season.For some, that many have nothing to do with gameday effort. It might only be about pregame preparation.For others, yeah, they might make business decisions when it comes to tackling and hustling.This subject arose recently when Bucs Super Bowl-winning head coach Bucco Bruce Arians visited the Barstool Gambling show.Co-host Will Compton, the retired linebacker, referenced how he had been a part of bad teams and saw players spending far too much time focused on postseason vacation plans instead of football. Arians eagerly jumped in and said, “They’re checking out at Thanksgiving.”Joe saw evidence of this during The Lost Decade of Buccaneers football (2009-2018). Also, a former Bucs assistant coach once told Joe over a cold beverage that many assistant coaches are glued to media late in a bad season because they’re concerned about their current jobs — in addition to exploring potential opportunities with new teams.Joe’s takeaway was that coaches also get distracted when a team is circling the drain.On Sunday, the Bucs face a tanking Giants club in New Jersey before heading to play the depleted Panthers at Carolina (a team that just traded quality players for draft picks via trade).After that, the Raiders (2-8) make a December trip to Tampa from Vegas for a 1 o’clock kickoff.The Bucs (4-6) simply cannot lose those games against those teams.Bring canned foods to help local food banks and/or a toy for a local child.Bill Currie Ford, a mile north of the stadium on Dale Mabry Highway, is the place to watch the Bucs on Sunday.  The watch party runs from noon through the end of the game.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/11/victor-cruz-suggests-giants-should-tank-for-arch-manning/|Victor Cruz Suggests Giants Should Tank For Arch Manning|So Joe sat down to listen to an interview today with retired Giants fan-favorite receiver Victor Cruz.Why? Because Cruz caught passes from Bucs offensive coordinator Liam Coen in college, and he stays tight with the Giants, the Bucs opponent on Sunday.Cruz didn’t talk about his old college buddy, unfortunately, or his former Giants teammate and current Bucs receiver Sterling Shepard.However, Cruz did talk about how miserable the Giants offense has been this season and for several years.In fact, through the past nine seasons, the Giants have averaged more than 20 points per game only twice. This year, New York is at 15 points per game.It’s a big reason they benched starting QB Daniel Jones for Sunday’s game and will roll with No. 3 QB Tommy DeVito.Per Cruz on SiriusXM NFL Radio, the Giants offense has no consistency and lacks athleticism and playmaking ability. Yes, he’s high on stud rookie receiver Malik Nabers, but Cruz says Nabers can’t be moved around and defenses are able double him up with enough success.Nabers had a special start to this season but he hasn’t busted 70 yards receiving or scored a TD in each of the past four games.The cynical side of Joe will say that probably means he’ll go for 115 yards and a touchdown against the Bucs, but the Giants have little else.Cruz says DeVito brings a lot of energy and will play loose with a nothing-to-lose attitude, and Cruz suspects the Giants will approach the game that way. Joe believes that could make the Giants dangerous.But how miserable are the Giants?Cruz suggested — during an intelligent conversation without the hint of a hot take — that the Giants should approach the 2025 NFL Draft and with a tanking mentality so they can be in line to pick QB Arch Manning at the top of the draft in 2026.The Bucs simply cannot lose to the Giants on Sunday.|2024-11-19 21:33:00|316|18|5|Victor Cruz|Giants offense struggles|6| Mixed sentiments about team performance|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Mort"", ""post"": ""If the giants beat the bucs, the season is over and we need to just pull a Lovie and start young guys every game the rest of the way.

Baker Mayfield can win a Super Bowl. That was the message yesterday from the Bucs’ first Super Bowl-winning quarterback, Brad Johnson.“No doubt about it,” Johnson said of Mayfield’s championship potential.Johnson was a guest of WDAE radio fill-in host Rock Riley.“[Mayfield] has got all the skill set. He was the first pick of the draft. He’s been through adversity. He’s had to live it; he’s had to bounce from a couple of different teams and now he’s found his home. You know what I mean? He produces and he gets the most out of the players around him. …. He’s going to be around a long time, so I would jump on the bandwagon. But until you do it, you haven’t done.”Joe will note that Johnson was in the house nine days ago at the Bucs-49ers game, and he was seen on the field.Johnson added that he likes the gameday leadership and energy he sees from Mayfield.|2024-11-19 19:00:00|181|30|8|Brad Johnson|Brad Johnson believes Baker Mayfield can win a Super Bowl.|3| Mixed sentiments towards Mayfield|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Dave Pear"", ""post"": ""He definitely can.

Now the offense is up drastically be it Coen or him releasing the reins on it. He still has a pathetic defense which should be and has been a whole lot better. Is this all Bowles fault? Maybe not. As a coach for 20+ years I see there is conditioning problems. They show up in the 2nd and 4th quarters. The team can\u2019t play more than 1 quarter without being exhausted to the point of mental and physical mistakes happen. This is because practices aren\u2019t being run right. As a soccer coach you run your practices like game situations. So you play 2 quarters rest 15 min. Then run 2 more quarters. Just as you would in a game. If you run 1 game. rest run another quarter your body isn\u2019t prepared for a whole hame. Mental mistakes has been proven to be caused by physical exhaustion. This could also explain all the muscle strains and tears as the body isn\u2019t conditioned properly. Either the body is over worked and not enough rest or under worked and not used to a full game. So this could be a product of the head coach not planning practices properly or conditioning staff not preparing workout properly or a combination of both. Tweaking practices will help. But doing that prepare for either more injuries to start if you go the wrong direction until it is fixed.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/11/top-nfl-rookie-running-back-honors-for-bucky-irving/|Top NFL Rookie Running Back Honors For Bucky Irving|So who’s the best rookie running back in the NFL?First, Joe will note that five running backs were drafted before Bucs rookie RB Bucky Irving, and the five running backs snatched after Irving came within the nine selections following Irving going to Tampa Bay in Round 4.Back to the question? The best rookie RB is a toss-up now between Irving (492 yards, 5.1 yards per carry and 4 rushing touchdowns) and Giants running back Tyrone Tracy Jr. (545 yards, 5.1 yards per carry and 3 rushing TDs).Irving has been more active in the passing game with 26 catches to Tracy’s 18.No other rookie running back has been close to their league. Joe find that very cool, considering Irving was a fourth-round pick and Tracy went in Round 5.Also, both Irving and Tracy have had a devastating fumble that likely cost their team a win. Tracy’s came two weeks ago against the Panthers — and he’s had a bye week to think about it before facing the Bucs on Sunday.Recently, ESPN NFL writers Matt Bowen, Kalyn Kahler, Jeff Legwold, Matt Miller and Jordan Reid gathered to ranked the top-10 NFL rookies.Irving didn’t make the cut, but he was the only running back on the “just missed” level, which essentally the list of rookies ranked Nos. 11-15.There were seven honorable mentions in the rankings but Tracy didn’t make that cut. However, Bucs rookie cornerback Tykee Smith did.|2024-11-19 18:27:00|235|14|6|Bucky Irving|Close race between Irving and Tracy for top rookie RB.|3| Mixed sentiment towards coaching decisions and player performance in the Buccaneers blog post.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""fire bowles"", ""post"": ""i love bucky he is way batter at running then white but todd bowles dosent put him in alot"", ""post_time"": ""November 19th, 2024 at 1:32 pm""}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""I Remember 21"", ""post"": ""Licht showing improvement at drafting RBs, you love to see it!

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/11/behind-the-fire-bowles-frenzy/|Behind The “Fire Bowles Frenzy”|BY IRA KAUFMANThere are a lot of arrows trained on Todd Bowles as the primary culprit for Tampa Bay’s 4-6 start.That’s understandable because NFL head coaches take most of the heat when a team struggles. Four consecutive losses have triggered a “Fire Bowles” frenzy and Buc Nation appears eager for a change at the top.And while Bowles has surely made his share of mistakes during this extended tailspin, there’s one question begging for an answer:Why is Jason Licht getting a pass?You’re not going to read another article in this market regarding Licht’s role in this franchise crisis. Unlike Bowles, his job is secure, even if the Bucs stumble to a 7-10 finish.That’s understandable because Licht has made more than a few outstanding picks in recent drafts. He also built a championship roster in 2020 — and the Glazers are forever grateful.But Licht’s strengths on the personnel side tend to mask some flaws that have contributed to the current malaise.While Bowles is trying everything in his power to manufacture a consistent pass rush, he doesn’t have the horses to lead a stampede.Licht has tried to draft dynamic edge rushers. Lord knows, he has tried. Noah Spence, Joe Tryon-Shoyinka, Logan Hall, YaYa Diaby and Chris Braswell were drafted to collapse the pocket.So far, the pocket is winning.Let’s remember that Shaq Barrett was signed as a free agent and Jason Pierre-Paul was acquired through trade. This offseason, Licht took a flyer on free agent Randy Gregory, who is now out of the league.Without facing the challenge of an edge rush, even an immobile quarterback like Kirk Cousins has carved the Bucs up twice. The lack of an edge rush has forced Bowles to commit additional resources in an effort to place passers under duress.Licht also has been a little loose with Glazer money.The Tristan Wirfs contract made him the highest paid offensive lineman in league history. The Antoine Winfield Jr. contract made him the highest paid defensive back in NFL history — the first time a safety earned that designation.Bowles has plenty to answer for. His game management has been uneven and his defense simply doesn’t tackle well. Only two teams have given up more yards after the catch and only nine teams have missed more tackles.Buc fans don’t want to hear the word “miscommunication” ever again, especially with almost two-thirds of the regular season in the books.But let’s not skip over the general manager when looking for culprits.Before the trade deadline, Licht failed to make a move to help this reeling defense. He essentially told the rest of the league “we’re good,” even though the Bucs are far from a a complete team.Has this coaching staff brought out the absolute best from this roster? Absolutely not, but there are holes that haven’t been filled and the addition of Mike Edwards certainly doesn’t qualify as a game-changer.Jamel Dean will be an upgrade on Josh Hayes when he returns, but Mr. Dean has now gone 32 consecutive regular-season games without an interception.Bowles never claimed to be the second coming of Bill Walsh or Bill Belichick. His conservative nature gets the best of him at times, but he has held this team together through some difficult times. The 2023 Bucs could have folded at 4-7. Instead, they won six of their next seven games and played very competitively on the playoff road, despite a talent gap against the Lions.That talent gap has widened this season, even though Tampa Bay somehow won at Detroit in Week 2.There’s a growing call for the Bucs to do everything possible to keep Liam Coen, so impressive as an offensive coordinator. Rookies Bucky Irving and Graham Barton have played key roles for an attack that averages 28 points.“Let’s dump Bowles and bump Coen up to head coach” is a popular refrain.When the Glazers elevated Dirk Koetter from OC to head coach in 2016, fans rejoiced. Three years and 29 losses later, it was apparent the Koetter experiment had failed.One day, Licht will justifiably enter the Buc Ring of Honor. Licht talked Bruce Arians out of the broadcast booth in 2019 and a year later, Tom Brady liked the roster enough to sign with Tampa Bay.But make no mistake … Licht has misjudged the talent on the defensive side of the ball and Bowles is paying a harsh price. K.J. Britt can’t cover and Buc edge rushers can’t put quarterbacks on their ass.Bowles has had an off week to figure out how to help an embattled secondary. The cavalry isn’t coming, so this outside pass rush has to improve from within.Good luck with that.For a coach who likes challenges, this one’s a whopper.Great time ahead Sunday!Watch the Bucs game free on Sunday with a Bucs great at Bill Currie Ford.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/11/mike-edwards-hopes-to-spark-the-defense/|Mike Edwards Hopes To “Spark” The Defense|Since his rookie year when the Bucs didn’t make the playoffs in 2019, former and now-returned Bucs safety Mike Edwards no longer knows what it’s like to play in a season when his team doesn’t make the playoffs.With the Bucs on the cusp of securing a spot on the couch for the playoffs in January, Edwards hopes he can help find a way to rally the team in the final seven games.Edwards has two rings to his name, one with the Bucs in 2020 and last year with the Chiefs. He hopes all his experience can somehow help the Bucs rattle off a string of victories.“Hopefully I can bring a spark or whatever [the defense] may need, bring any type of help that I can bring to this team,” Edwards said yesterday from One Buc Palace. “I mean, not just defense, but the whole team and yeah, they had struggles but they also had some great parts of the season.”Edwards made a good point. He’s also a strong special teams guy. Who can forget how Edwards raced downfield on the kickoff team for the Bucs in Indianapolis to make a touchdown-saving tackle in the final moments of a 38-31 Bucs win that, had Edwards not made the tackle, would have turned a Bucs win into a heartbreaking loss?Edwards believes one play in four of the Bucs’ six losses was the difference. Edwards hopes he can provide that one missing play.“I’ve been keeping up with them from afar, watching some games, stuff like that,” he said. “Still a good team. The record might not show, but still a good team.”Despite being a part-time starter with the Bucs, Edwards has always been a ballhawk. Edwards had three pick-sixes, seven picks and three fumble recoveries in his four Tampa Bay years.A takeaway or a forced turnover might just be what the Bucs need.|2024-11-19 14:00:00|310|30|7|Mike Edwards|Edwards aims to boost Bucs defense and playoff hopes.|8| Mixed sentiments on Mike Edwards' return|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""ModHairKen"", ""post"": ""Always loved this guy.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/11/larry-foote-acknowledges-antoine-winfields-struggles/|Larry Foote Acknowledges Antoine Winfield Struggles|Joe just has to believe All-Pro safety Antoine Winfield is hurt. He doesn’t look remotely the same as he did this summer, forget about last year when he was named All-Pro.Winfield was sick during training camp the way he raced all over the field in scrimmages. He was perhaps faster than Joe had ever seen him. And Winfield played lights-out ball against the Commandos to open the season.It was very late in that game, a decisive Bucs win, that Winfield hurt his foot. He missed the next four games.(Missing four games with an injured foot sounds to Joe like a fracture or a severe sprain.)Even inside linebackers coach/defensive run game coordinator Larry Foote all but said Winfield may be having his worst season as a pro.“Winfield – he hasn’t missed a lot of tackles, and it seems like he’s missed a majority of his tackles in one season than he did through all of his career,” Foote said. “It’s tough. We’ve got to concentrate. More hats to the ball – it’s tough to bring guys down in this league.”So how does Foote help Winfield prevent missing so many tackles? Foote said the first step is to get to the ball — it’s hard to make a tackle if a defender isn’t in position to make a tackle.So hustle and good things will happen.“We’ve got to harp on the fundamentals – wrapping guys up, keep your head up,” Foote said. “The main thing to focus on is getting off of blocks. We need more hats to the ball.”Foote also said in regards to the pass defense that the Bucs have decided to go back to square one and focus on fundamentals. For Joe, that seems smart.Joe was starting to believe what Todd Bowles might want to do could be too complicated and maybe he needed to dial back his defense.Joe’s first order of business would be to let defensive tackles be defensive tackles and turn them loose on a quarterback on every passing down. Quit trying to be cutesy having them pretend to be safeties and drop back into pass coverage.The Bucs didn’t draft Vita Vea and Calijah Kancey in the first round for their coverage skills.|2024-11-19 13:00:00|366|21|3|Antoine Winfield|Winfield struggling with injuries and performance|2| Most comments express frustration with Bowles' defensive scheme and player performance.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""View from 132"", ""post"": ""They mentioned last night the 49ers / Texans system doesn\u2019t fool offenses.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/11/todd-bowles-has-a-brutal-record-coming-off-bye/|Todd Bowles Has A Brutal Record Coming Off Byes|"This is not very encouraging.Todd Bowles coming off a bye week has a terrible record as a head coach. Disturbing.One wouldn’t think coming off a bye with a rested team and extra days to prepare for the next opponent that Bowles’ teams would regularly crap the bed. It’s really mindblowing.In the six previous seasons Bowles has been a head coach, four with the Jets and two with the Bucs, Bowles has one win coming off a bye. One.As Bucs head coach, Bowles is 0-2 in the game following a bye. His only win came in 2015, his first season leading the Jets. So Bowles is on a five-game, post-bye losing streak.Here is Bowles’ post-bye-week record:2015: Jets 34, Redskins 20
2016: Patriots 22, Jets 17
2017: Panthers 35, Jets 27
2018: Patriots 27, Jets 13
2022: Browns 23, Bucs 17 (OT)
2023: Lions 20, Bucs 6Bowles’ loss to the Browns was one of the most galling choke jobs Joe has ever seen. Tom Brady was in the midst of marching the Bucs for a late game-winning drive in regulation. But Bowles pulled the rug out from under Brady citing the possibility Brady could throw a pick.Tom. Freaking. Brady! The nerve!!!To that point in the season (Game 11) Brady had a grand total of two interceptions.And all that came after Bowles took the ball out of Brady’s hands at the Cleveland 37-yard line on 4th-and-2 on a drive that could have put the game away."|2024-11-19 07:00:00|243|50|2|Todd Bowles|Poor post-bye performance streak for Todd Bowles as head coach.|3| Mixed reactions towards Bowles with concerns about coaching abilities and team performance.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Dave Pear"", ""post"": ""But, his Great Defender will step in to correct everyone as to why results are wrong and deflection, slight of hand and a lot of words are correct."", ""post_time"": ""November 19th, 2024 at 2:18 am""}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Bucswin?"", ""post"": ""The start of the questionable/costly decisions.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/11/jason-licht-among-best-at-draft/|Jason Licht Among Best At Draft|From time to time Joe reads how fans, frustrated with this or that, want to run Bucs AC/DC-loving general manager Jason Licht.This perplexes Joe.Does Joe get frustrated Licht won’t stop at anything to find an edge rusher? Yeah. Is Joe bewildered why Licht wouldn’t go get another receiver (like playoff-bound teams such as Kansas City and Buffalo and Pittsburgh did)? Yes.But, you sometimes have to accept the greater good. After all, Licht built a Super Bowl winner for this town. There aren’t too many guys with his resume panhandling for work on interstate off-ramps.Judging by a graphic that came across Joe’s Twitter timeline yesterday, running off Licht would likely be a really dumb move. So only four teams since 2014 have drafted a higher percentage of Pro Bowlers than Licht (see graphic below). And 2014 was the same season Licht came to Tampa Bay and took over the draft.Aside from his drafts, look who Licht also lured to Tampa: Bucco Bruce Arians, Ndamukong Suh, Antonio Brown, Playoff Lenny, foot-rubbing Rob Gronkowski and of course, Tom Brady. Licht also was able to steal Jason Pierre-Paul from the Giants and sign Bucs sacks king Shaq Barrett on the cheap in free agency.Why would someone want to push a guy like that out the door?If for whatever reason Licht was shown the door, he wouldn’t make it through his back door before he started getting job offers texted to him.But yeah, maybe Team Glazer can find the next Bruce Almighty to run the pirate ship.|2024-11-19 05:00:00|252|31|8|Jason Licht|Licht is highly successful at drafting and signing players.|7| Mixed sentiments about Buccaneers GM Licht with some optimism and criticism shining through.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Kenton Smith"", ""post"": ""Hey Joe, I agree Licht is great in his role. \u201cAside from his drafts\u201d\u2026 that\u2019s quite a list of players he\u2019s lured to Tampa.
