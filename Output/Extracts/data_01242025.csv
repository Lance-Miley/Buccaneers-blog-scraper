https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/liam-coens-wife-lashes-back/|Liam Coen’s Wife Lashes Back|So among the many unsourced, gossip-magazine-style reports from major news outlets about former Bucs offensive coordinator Liam Coen jilting the the Bucs to take the Jaguars’ head coaching job, was a recurring take that Coen blamed his lack of communication with the Bucs on a sick child. Some presented that premis as if Coen was hiding behind a my-kid’s-sick story like a hungover single dad skipping work after watching a day’s worth of World Cup games. Maybe he did. Maybe he didn’t. And that’s why Joe has been using “allegedly” when referring to all these reports. Those who say they know based on anonymous sources are too often trusting the wrong people. Not always, but too often for Joe to swallow the entire Coen story whole. Was Coen at a routine doctor visit with his child? Or was he in the hospital? Was he at the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville or a second-rate urgent care facility east Tampa? Joe has no clue, though Coen’s wife Ashley took to X to share her outrage. “I hate that I even have to say this, but when people are negative about my kids, I will not be silent. Our son is sick, we were at the hospital yesterday seeing a specialist for his autoimmune disease,” Mrs. Coen typed. “Please don’t spread misinformation and assume because you heard one side.” Coen previously had referenced his child being sick in a news conference at One Buc Palace. Unfortunately, Joe has experience with chronic disease in children and the way Coen said it months ago made Joe at the time think Coen wasn’t referencing a routine illness. Regardless, Coen deserves zero rope for unprofessionally communicating with the Bucs and slithering out of his agreement the wrong way. But his shenanigans may not be as severe as has been ruled by the court of public opinion.|2025-01-24 16:56:00|309|176|2|Liam Coen|Controversy over communication and sick child explanation.|3|Mixed reactions to Coen's actions and family involvement, questioning integrity and decision-making.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Dewey Selmon"", ""post"": ""I don\u2019t care if he was on Mars he didn\u2019t answer his phone for hours."", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""24th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""4:59"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Murph"", ""post"": ""He didn\u2019t have time to respond to Bucs but he was able to negotiate with Jacksonville.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/liam-coen-issues-statement/|Liam Coen Issues Statement|With all the wide and varying stories floating out on Twitter of what exactly, allegedly happened between the Bucs and Liam Coen, now the key figure in this drama has spoken. Sort of. In a statement given/released to Peter Schrager of NFL Network, Coen basically thanks his family, the Bucs and Todd Bowles for getting him into a position to have a chance at being an NFL head coach. Joe is not taking any swipes or backhands at anyone with the following sentence: This statement has the scent of a public relations director typing it and emailing/texting it to Schrager. FYI, Schrager has been nothing but first class dealing with Joe. There are no insinuations here other than Coen’s note feels like they’re not in Coen’s voice or at least were not spoken by Coen. (If Joe is wrong, Joe will gladly post a public apology to Schrager, who Joe likes a lot.) In this statement, Coen does not address in any way the many cringy allegations that have been lobbed at him or attributed to him in the many unsourced claims on social media and broadcasts.|2025-01-24 14:47:00|187|110|8|Liam Coen|Coen responds to allegations with gratitude|3|Mixed sentiments, overall negative tone with some support for Liam Coen's career move.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Kstoges"", ""post"": ""guys a snake nothing short of it good riddance oh and T law is a bum bust and it\u2019s gunna crash and burn"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""24th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""2:49"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Barbosa"", ""post"": ""Reeks of a pr team or HR.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/manna-from-heaven-just-fell/|Manna From Football Heaven Just Fell|Joe was researching for known assisants working with quality offensive play-calling head coaches like Sean McVay, Kyle Shanahan, Matt LaFleur and Kevin O’Connell. Sadly, none of these guys have experience as a playcaller. And then… Just like that, Adam Schefter of BSPN reported the shocking news that Houston coach DeMeco Ryans just ran offensive coordinator Bobby Slowik. Slowik, 37, is now Exhibit-A why Liam Coen is coach of the Jags. You cannot pass up a chance to be a head coach because you never know when the next chance comes. Slowik was on everyone’s hot list last year as a potential head coach while he molded the Texans with rookie quarterback C.J. Stroud into an explosive offense. (Remember the Bucs-Texans shootout in 2023?) Now, with the Bucs with raw, open nerves from just losing their gifted offensive coordinator Coen, Slowik is a free agent. Joe could not fly this guy Slowik in quick enough. He’s a former Shanahan disciple and Joe knows Coen and Slowik are from the same Shanahan tree (Coen by way of Sean McVay). Outside of Lincoln Riley, Slowik might be the perfect replacement. Slowik is an experienced playcaller and look what he did with all the injuries to the Texans’ wide receivers. Joe would be very, very, very, very happy if Slowik ended up as the Bucs’ offensive coordinator.|2025-01-24 14:08:00|223|75|8|Bobby Slowik|Unexpected hiring stirs excitement among football fans.|4|Mixed reactions to OC potential hires, uncertainty, some fans hopeful, others skeptical or critical.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Matt"", ""post"": ""Explain why we\u2019d want a guy whose team scored over 130 points FEWER than the Bucs did this year?"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""24th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""2:10"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""MF Bucs"", ""post"": ""Yes to this"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""24th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""2:11"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""Joe"", ""post"": ""Explain why we\u2019d want a guy whose team scored over 130 points FEWER than the Bucs did this year?"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""24th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""2:11"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter3"": {""username"": ""Dr. Bucenstein"", ""post"": ""I hope we get him"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""24th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""2:12"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter4"": {""username"": ""Mr. Editor"", ""post"": ""Working with Baker Mayfield, Mike Evans, Bucky Irving, and others will certainly attract coaching candidates to the Bucs."", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""24th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""2:12"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter5"": {""username"": ""Matt"", ""post"": ""\u201cExplain to Joe why you expect offenses to light up scoreboards when starters get hurt.\u201d"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""24th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""2:14"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter6"": {""username"": ""JoeSea"", ""post"": ""Explain why we\u2019d want a guy whose team scored over 130 points FEWER than the Bucs did this year?"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""24th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""2:16"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter7"": {""username"": ""Joe"", ""post"": ""Joe \u2014 love you man, but he scored 5 points more the year before."", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""24th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""2:17"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter8"": {""username"": ""Joe"", ""post"": ""Look @ the OL differences"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""24th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""2:18"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter9"": {""username"": ""KingofTampa"", ""post"": ""The Texans dealt with a lot of injuries to the offense last year, that\u2019s why they scored 130 points less than the Bucs did!

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/i-dont-remember-the-last-time-ive-heard-one-team-this-hot-and-bothered-by-a-coach-taking-another-deal/|“I Don’t Remember The Last Time I’ve Heard One Team This Hot And Bothered By A Coach Taking Another Deal”|The Bucs were either a victim of an attempted shakedown by a valued assistant coach or the Bucs tried to strong-arm a soon-to-be new NFL head coach. The truth very likely stands in the middle. Readers of JoeBucsFan.com have likely noticed that Joe has used the word “allegedly” several times the past 24 hours because nobody with the Bucs or Jaguars went on the record about what happened between the Bucs and former Bucs offensive coordinator/new Jags head coach Liam Coen. So Joe doesn’t truly believe every report of what happened. As uber NFL insider Adam Schefter of BSPN pointed out on “The Pat McAfee Show” today, there are wildly different versions of what went down. But the result is clear: Coen is now Jags head coach. And per Schefter, the Bucs are downright irate about this, thinking they got stabbed in the back. “Liam Coen has his thoughts and the Buccaneers have their thoughts,” Schefter said. “And you can believe whatever you want. I can tell you there’s two different schools of thought. “I would just say this: In 20 years, this century, since the turn of the century — I don’t remember the last time I’ve heard one team this hot and bothered by a coach taking another deal.” Someone with the Bucs and likely someone with the Jags is surely texting his or her fingers off with Albert Breer, Diana Russini and Schefter. Otherwise, where would they get all the alleged details of what happened inside the walls of One Buc Palace the past week? The alleged misdeeds even include suggesting Coen used a sick child as a shield to dodge the Bucs and take a clandestine trip to Jacksonville. That’s a pretty heavy accusation and dastardly if true. “There are a lot of different versions of what is going down,” Schefter said. “I can just tell you that, I don’t remember when was the last time I heard a team that irate over a coaching decision.” As the creator, curator and overall guru of Pro Football Talk, the great Mike Florio, likes to point out, silence invites speculation. And unless or until someone (Jason Licht, Todd Bowles, Shad Con Khan, Coen) goes on the record and explains what transpired, Joe can’t be confident fully buying all the details of these reports.  |2025-01-24 12:53:00|385|100|4|Liam Coen|Bucs and Jags dispute over coaching deal.|3|Mixed reactions to the OC departure and future prospects are uncertain and varied.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""CalBucsFan"", ""post"": ""There was a time where being a man of your word meant something in society, sad how much mankind has changed.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/todd-bowles-history-with-jake-peetz/|Todd Bowles History With Jake Peetz|So regular readers here read multiple stories the past few days quoting Jaguars radio play-by-play man Frank Frangie, the top afternoon radio host in Jacksonville. Frangie’s intel proved to be on the money about the Liam Coen mess, which led to Coen leaving the Bucs to take the Jaguars head coaching job yesterday. Frangie was ahead of the reporting curve. No surprise. Frangie was getting his info directly from the team. Joe listened to hours of Frangie’s show (1010 XL) to find nuggets to share with Bucs fans. One nugget was Frangie stating that Jake Peetz, the Seahawks’ passing game coordinator, was the Bucs’ next choice behind Liam Coen to be Tampa Bay’s offensive coordinator last year after Dave Canales left for Carolina. Frangie made it clear on the air that he is a friend of Peetz, even saying Peetz is Coen’s first choice to join him Jacksonville as offensive coordiantor. Peetz was a Jaguars scout for several years as a scout before coaching there and moving on to Coach at Alabama and at other NFL stops. He also called plays for LSU in 2021 before heading to the Rams for two seasons, where he worked with Coen. So if Bowles indeed was prepared to hire Peetz a year ago, Joe presumes that came with Baker Mayfield’s blessing. And Peetz was with the Rams as Sean McVay assistant when Mayfield was there. Would Bowles be eager to hire Coen clone at offensive coordinator to try and keep the most possible continuity for Mayfield’s playbook?|2025-01-24 12:34:00|254|31|6|Todd Bowles|Jake Peetz considered for offensive coordinator position by Bowles last year.|3|Mixed feelings about Coen's departure, criticism of his actions, and speculation on the next OC.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""TheBucsAnthem"", ""post"": ""I still have no idea why ANYONE on this site or at OneBuc HQ would be mad Coen left."", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""24th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""12:37"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Tye"", ""post"": ""From Peetz perspective, if he gets offer from both Coen and Bowels, the likely choice told Coen and Jags ..

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/absolute-chaos/|“Absolute Chaos”|Former NFL punter and current media juggernaut Pat McAfee’s head seems to be spinning as much as Joe’s. McAfee, on his popular show today, is trying to make sense of what he called the “absolute chaos” of what happened the past 24 hours or so between the Bucs, the Jags and Liam Coen. McAfee acknowledged that nerves are raw on the West Coast of the East Coast with how this Coen drama shook out. He also was careful to use the word “allegedly” many times because no one with the Jags or Bucs or Coen himself has gone on the record to explain what the hell happened in this NFL love triangle. This is the craziest Bucs story Joe has seen since the Josh Freeman drama in 2013. The signing of Tom Brady was right up there, too.

In the playoff game, his offense was shut down, except for Mayfield\u2019s almost faultless passing and impromptu running. Yes, time of possession was limited, but in the last quarter, instead of sticking to the passing game, he made stretches for running plays that appeared unrehearsed.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/team-glazer-deserves-share-of-liam-coen-blame/|Team Glazer Deserves Share Of Liam Coen Blame|The savvy, shrewd, seasoned, calculating and wildly successful international negotiators at One Buc Palace aren’t named Jason Licht, Todd Bowles or Mike Greenberg.  Team Glazer holds that honor. For 30 years they’ve run the Buccaneers and dealt with all types of coaches and agents, and good and bad actors of all kinds. Throw in another 20 years running a multibillion dollar soccer franchise in England with business partnerships across the globe. Joe can only imagine the many hundreds of business dealings Team Glazer has managed that fans don’t know existed. Team Glazer is world class when it comes to running a sports franchise. Love them or hate them or don’t care a lick about any ownership group, there is no denying Team Glazers wins in their arena off the field far, far more than they lose. Well, Team Glazer just lost Liam Coen. Retaining Coen was on them and however it went down, the “L” goes on the Team Glazer resume. Joe is not writing to be an ass. Somebody is responsible for the great pain currently pulsating through Bucs fandom. Just like when the Bucs get throttled in between the white lines, the head coach is responsible no matter what the actual game looked like. This one falls on the top of the food chain. On Dec. 16, Joe wrote a post titled, “Moving All-In On Liam Coen.” Joe called on Team Glazer to be “clever and creative” and to “step up with a massive check soon as part of a historic and unique offer” to keep Coen from interviewing with another team. “If Team Glazer has to pay Coen more than Todd Bowles so he’ll pass up head coaching interviews, then so be it,” Joe wrote. “It’s a safe bet that Coen has a price. And Joe is confident it would behoove Team Glazer to meet it.” Yeah, Coen was that good last season and his retention was critical for the 2025 campaign. In Joe’s mind (and on the screen) was Team Glazer, in December, finding the lump sum number Coen required to not interview in the 2025 head coach hiring cycle. One interview and the money would have to be repaid with interest. It seems Team Glazer had a different approach. The Bucs didn’t realize they were dealing with a greedy snake, but that was on them to know who was slithering in their building and to take all possible precautions. Joe’s hope is to write a post reversing this Team Glazer decision 11 months from now — as the Bucs sit primed to win the NFC South with a dangerous offense.|2025-01-24 11:53:00|435|97|5|Team Glazer|Mixed feelings on Team Glazer's handling of Liam Coen.|4|Mixed feelings about Coen leaving, criticism of handling, acknowledging better opportunity, and optimism for future.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""ReenYeing"", ""post"": ""It wouldn\u2019t have stopped him"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""24th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""11:56"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""zzbucs"", ""post"": ""Joe, we lost an OC, we didn\u2019t lose Mike Evans or Tom Brady\u2026.

And, Joe is convinced from Bucs fans’ perspective, it represents an attempted shakedown of Team Glazer by Coen. Albert Breer of SI.com has a play-by-play account of how the Bucs and Coen worked inside the walls of One Buc Palace to try to make Coen happy, to no avail. In short, Todd Bowles and Bucs AC/DC-loving general manager Jason Licht, knowing Coen was going to interview with the Jags, got a figure from Coen what it would take for him to stay with the Bucs. How certain did the Bucs think they had a deal? Coen was texting players and fellow staffers how he was staying and how he looked forward to getting back on the practice fields preparing for the 2025 season. Team Glazer met his initial demands and still it wasn’t good enough for Coen, who then dragged his feet and bolted to Jacksonville when the Bucs met yesterday afternoon with Coen’s contract on the table ready for him to sign. Problem was, Coen blew off the meeting. Bucs brass was left at the altar while Coen was instead at the Jags’ headquarters. On Wednesday afternoon, with Coen expected to be at 1 Buccaneer Place to sign his deal, efforts by team brass to get ahold of Coen failed. Around 5 p.m., Coen called back to ask Licht if it was O.K. if he came in Thursday morning to sign the contract—rather than doing it that night—and Licht told him that was fine. Thursday morning came and went and Bucs officials (not just one but multiple suits) could not reach Coen, including assistant general manager Mike Greenberg who had to talk to Coen about a contract for an offensive assistant who also was about to sign a Bucs contract. Coen’s agent instead called the Bucs late Thursday morning to say Coen was unable to get to One Buc Palace as he was tending to a personal matter. The Jags, Breer types, were equally adamant that Coen not divulge to the Bucs he was in Jacksonville. So Jags chieftain Shad Con Khan doesn’t look like a prince in all this drama, either. Khan apparently was scared the NFL would hammer him over the Rooney Rule. All in all, Breer’s details of this drama are almost breathtaking.|2025-01-24 11:44:00|403|61|5|Liam Coen|Drama between Coen|2|Mixed reactions, criticizing Coen's integrity and professionalism, questioning Jaguars' Rooney Rule compliance.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Eric"", ""post"": ""he is a lying piece of s**t. our offense will still hum without him and he will be fired in 2-3 years."", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""24th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""11:49"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Mondy"", ""post"": ""This report makes Coen and Shad look horrible and you know what they deserve each other."", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""24th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""11:50"", ""am""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""RagingBrisket"", ""post"": ""Seems like it violates the Rooney rule.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/ross-tucker-to-bucs-fans-get-over-it/|Ross Tucker To Bucs Fans: Get Over It!|Joe has chatted with Ross Tucker a handful of times at NFL events. Really good guy. Obviously very smart given his Princeton degree and who he played college football with (Kyle Brandt). And Tucker’s family of football-specific podcasts is among the best things found on the interwebs. So when he witnessed like all Bucs fans the drama that unfolded yesterday afternoon and evening with former Bucs offensive coordinator and new Jags coach Liam Coen staying/not staying/hiding behind his child (allegedly)/secretly flying off to Jacksonville (allegedly)/dodging Bucs calls/texts (allegedly) and then agreeing to run the Jags for some $13 million a year with unforeseen power, Tucker had zero issue with Coen bolting Tampa Bay. Tucker explains he’s seen first-hand how some NFL teams have treated their employees. As a result, Tucker doesn’t believe it was impersonal or unethical in any way for Coen to do what he did. Well, Joe does have an issue if what has been reported really did happen (Joe doesn’t have direct access to Bucs’ texts or intercommunications among employees). Joe does have an issue with Coen being less than upfront with the Bucs. No one has a problem with Coen getting paid. No one has a problem with Coen taking an offer he can’t refuse. How it went down was seedy and shady and unbecoming (allegedly). Call Joe dumb and or naive, but there is still value in being honest and cordial in this cynical, cruel, cutthroat world.|2025-01-24 10:52:00|242|80|5|Ross Tucker|Tucker defends Liam Coen's departure from Bucs to Jags.|4|Mixed feelings and criticisms about Coen's departure and business ethics.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Tbbucs3"", ""post"": ""99% of people would absolutely not have a secret meeting behind the backs of the organization that gave them a chance."", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""24th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""10:54"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Panhandle Buc"", ""post"": ""Take a higher paying job \u2013 sure!

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/chucky-and-todd-bowles/|Chucky And Todd Bowles|Could Todd Bowles call on a guy who saved the Bucs in 2002 and wants back into the NFL so badly he’d drink a six-pack of warm Stag beer just to return? The guy has an office just down the road from The Licht House. That would be Chucky, the original Bucs Super Bowl-winning head coach. Joe would not hire Chucky. He didn’t do all that well in his last return to the NFL in Las Vegas/Oakland. Only after he left/was forced out/fired did the Raiders play their best football of the 2021 season and make it to the playoffs. And if you watch his Barstool Sports videos, it’s clear Chucky does not like modern offenses, RPOs and quarterbacks clapping from shotgun. He doesn’t like it at all. But also clear in these videos is that Chucky likes to run the ball. And so does Bowles. And boy, do the Bucs have running backs. Players have changed since Chucky took over the Bucs in 2002. Even 20 years ago, players bristled under his boot and to this day a lot of his former players have nothing to do with him, though many still adore him. One of his biggest problems was relating to players. Some Vegas players admitted they grew burned out from all the Chucky yelling and hollering. They wanted coaching. And as Bum Phillips once famously said, “Hollerin’ ain’t coachin.'” Joe knows Chucky likes Todd Bowles (recent photo above). Hell, Chucky was in the Team Glazer suite earlier this year taking in a Bucs game. It was rumored that the appearance was part of Chucky’s pathway back into the good graces of the NFL. Let’s just say Joe would not be shocked if Chucky was hired by Bowles. (Chucky happens to have the same agent as Bucs AC/DC-loving Jason Licht, FYI.) And who wouldn’t love a coach who names plays after hot women?|2025-01-24 09:00:00|315|75|4|Chucky|Speculation on potential hiring of Chucky by Todd Bowles.|4|Mixed feelings about Gruden returning as OC due to past successes and failures.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Couch Fan"", ""post"": ""I love Chucky but I agree.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/bucs-should-have-a-news-conference-soon/|Bucs Should Have A News Conference Soon|The power players at One Buc Palace know what Bucs fans share about their feelings online. And that means team officials know the current chaos and unrest among their fanbase after the Liam Coen departure for Jacksonville yesterday.  In fact, some of that chaos was fueled by the folks at One Buc Palace through how they chose to communicate with fans what happened with Coen — or didn’t happen — via unsourced comments to media. Now, Joe believes, it’s time to clean up the mess and give Bucs fans a group hug of unity, calm and strength. You know, show the kind of leadership the Bucs rave about having on their player roster. A news conference with head coach Todd Bowles and Buccaneers Ring of Honor general manager Jason Licht is a great place to start. Joe would even be good with just a solid interview exclusive to Buccaneers.com. The alternative is to leave the fans the team cares so much about hanging, feeling crappy and wondering what’s real and what’s not. When is that ever the right move? If that’s how the Bucs choose to proceed, it would be a very Liam Coen-like decision.|2025-01-24 06:16:00|195|102|4|Bucs|Fans call for unity and transparency amid chaos and unrest.|2|Mixed sentiments, leaning towards pessimistic.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""M Core"", ""post"": ""Sorry but marching consolation prize Lovie Bowles out to speak will not instill confidence"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""24th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""6:30"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""adam from ny"", ""post"": ""wow joe\u2026interesting take man\u2026"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""24th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""6:32"", ""am""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""adam from ny"", ""post"": ""i guess the bucs can now have a \u201cring of dishonor\u201d as well\u2026"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""24th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""6:35"", ""am""]}, ""commenter3"": {""username"": ""Permanently Moderated"", ""post"": ""What can they say that will be calming at this point?"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""24th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""6:37"", ""am""]}, ""commenter4"": {""username"": ""Tom Chase"", ""post"": ""RING OF DISHONOR GOES TO THE SNAKE COEN.HAHAHA"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""24th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""6:39"", ""am""]}, ""commenter5"": {""username"": ""ReenYeing"", ""post"": ""What are they even going to say?

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/money-drove-liam-coen-not-jags-leadership/|Money Drove Liam Coen, Not Jags Leadership|So which national “insider” will you trust when it comes to the Liam Coen mess? Is it a name you like that can be bought and sold easily, or is it Prickly Pete Prisco of CBS, who is on the ground in Jacksonville regularly? Prisco has roots in Jacksonville and has made a career out of being candid. At a recent NFL Scouting Combine, Joe was listening to a loud Prisco conversation with a famous colleague, who closed the chat and said goodbye to Prisco with the following salutation, “Stay angry, Pete.” And man, Prisco has been angry with fans on social media over the past 12 hours, slightly more than he usually is. Prisco has rejected what’s been sprayed around the country by other national insiders that claim Coen reunited with the Jaguars (after promsing the Bucs he’d stay in Tampa) because Jacksonville fired its general manager, Trent Baalke. Prisco over and over noted that money drove the action, not who was in the Jags front office. “The Jaguars are willing to pay Coen in a big way, which is the reason for his change of heart. Not Baalke leaving,” Prisco said in one of his gentler comments on X. He did note that Coen behaved like an unprofessional snake, the kind that breaks up with his girlfriend via text. “Coen didn’t handle telling the Bucs about his interest after agreeing to stay,” Prisco said. “Just say you were opening it back up again, rather than hiding from it.” Joe knows it’s nearly always about the money, regardless. And considering Coen seems to have attended the Antonio Brown school of professionalism, it’s surely a safe bet Coen was all about the money. A Bucs-fan cynic might say if Coen was that money hungry, then Team Glazer dropped the ball on retaining Coen by not offering him more cash to stay in Tampa weeks ago: a giant one-time payout to not take any head coach interview.|2025-01-24 05:28:00|326|66|5|Liam Coen|Money-driven decision-making causing controversy in Jacksonville.|2|Mixed reactions towards Coen's departure, critical of his actions but acknowledging financial motivations.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Darin"", ""post"": ""So overpay a snake?

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/bold-move-go-get-lincoln-riley-for-offensive-coordinator/|Bold Move: Go Get Lincoln Riley For Offensive Coordinator|Joe knows Team Glazer likes splash. And if the powers that be at One Buc Palace really believe they have a team that can make a Super Bowl run in 2025, and they really believe in offense and really believe in scoring points and really believe in maxing out their quarterback’s talents, Joe has the perfect guy to rattle the cages of the NFL. Go save Lincoln Riley from his USC mediocrity. For those unaware, Riley was Baker Mayfield’s coach at Oklahoma when Mayfield won the Heisman Trophy. Riley is an offensive wizard and a direct disciple of the late, great Mike Leach. Riley has a strong knack for working with quarterbacks but also believes in the run game. Joe can just hear people: You’re drunk, Joe! Why would Riley leave USC? You’re nuts. Perhaps, but that’s just what people thought about Chip Kelly, who quit UCLA last year to become the offensive coordinator at the Ohio State. What happened? The Buckeyes just won the national title. So if a successful college head coach (Kelly was not cut out to be a college head coach in the NIL era) would quit to take a college offensive coordinator gig, why wouldn’t a 41-year-old college coach like Riley take an NFL offensive coordinator gig. And it’s not like Riley is a stranger around these parts. He’s popped up at Bucs games with field access passes to watch Mayfield. Riley has had some success at USC, but he hasn’t made the playoffs there. And Joe thinks Riley has done a better job at USC, specifically as the school has transitioned into the Big Ten, than most people give/don’t give him credit for. He’s beefed up USC’s defense and, well, is still struggling to find the next Caleb Williams. Who wouldn’t? Good luck. If Riley and the Bucs offense does well — there’s no reason why the Bucs offense wouldn’t do well — Riley would very likely get NFL job offers for head coach. And he wouldn’t have to worry about 18-year olds nagging him constantly wondering where their bag is. If the Bucs are really serious about winning, scoring points and maxing out Mayfield (if Liam Coen didn’t already max him out), a move to get Riley would truly shake the NFL.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/protect-and-pay-kevin-carberry/|Protect And Pay Kevin Carberry|The Bucs lost two key coaches yesterday. They cannot afford a third. With Liam Coen headed across north Florida to Jacksonville (hey Liam, you can build a Jeff Bezos-like estate in Palatka on a budget), Joe truly fears Coen will try to pickpocket Bucs offensive line coach Kevin Carberry. The Bucs lost Coen yesterday. Hours before, they lost Kacy Rodgers. They cannot lose Carberry, too. Since everyone (rightly so) was so blown away by the job Coen did with the offense as a whole, lost in the weeds was the job Carberry did with the offensive line. Aside from the defensive tackles and running backs, was there a stronger position group on the team? Joe sure doesn’t think so. One of many ways to lure a good offensive coordinator is for the guy to know his offensive line is in good hands. Under Carberry, the offensive line was in strong hands. Hey Bucs AC/DC-loving general manager Jason Licht and Team Glazer, don’t let Coen grab the best assistant currently on your payroll. Lock up Carberry with a handsome raise. Joe has a hunch Coen will try to hire Carberry as offensive coordinator in title only. That way Carberry will be very well compensated and would then only leave Jacksonville for a head coaching gig. It’s an old trick Chucky used with Bill Muir and it’s currently taken advantage of by Matt LaFleur with Adam Stenavich, too. If Coen plucks Carberry, the two coaches most responsible for the Bucs’ offensive success in 2024 will be gone.
