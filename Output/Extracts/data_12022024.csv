Britt, Mike Edwards And Punting|So Bucs coach Todd Bowles, wearing a sharp creamsicle hoodie, offered up info on a few Bucs players dealing with injuries. (Bowles did not offer up any info on Bucky Irving’s hip-pointer.) Bowles admitted Baker Mayfield has “a sore leg” from getting stomped on by Jadeveon Clowney  yesterday. Mayfield missed two plays spending time in the peep show tent and returned to the game. Mayfield is expected to be a gametime decision 90 minutes prior to kickoff of the Raiders game next Sunday. Bowles seemed doubtful that Mayfield will be able to fully participate in practices this week. “I think he will be comfortable by gametime,” Bowles said. “I’m not sure about his practice status this week.” The one-ply toilet-paper-thin Bucs inside linebacker corps just got thinner. Starter K.J. Britt, Bowles said, has a sprained ankle. Bowles didn’t offer a return timetable. Mike Edwards, Bowles said, will have an MRI exam on Tuesday for a hamstring injury. Bowles offered no timetable for him. And then there was the issue of punter Trenton Gill. The Bucs would have been better off with Turner Gill punting. Joe typed on Twitter last night that the Bucs should have just given Gill $500 to fly home commercial and the Bucs would ship him whatever he left in his locker at One Buc Palace. Gill was atrocious yesterday and even Bowles admitted that Gill “almost cost us the game” in regards to terrible field position. That stunt on the kickoff late, which gave the Stinking Panthers the ball on their own 40, was inexcusable. Bowles all but promised the Bucs would be working out punters this week.|2024-12-02 13:23:00|272|83|2.5|Todd Bowles|Injuries plague Bucs players|1|Mixed reactions on Jake Camarda causing uncertainty and disappointment among fans.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""gotbbucs"", ""post"": ""I don\u2019t know what Camarda did to get kicked off this team, but whatever the case may be, there better be some tryouts happening today for a replacement for this Gill clown."", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""2nd,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""1:27"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""darengibo"", ""post"": ""PAGING Jake Camarda.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/resounding-confidence-in-bucs-division-title-chances/|Resounding Confidence In Bucs’ Division Title Chances|Four big names paid big money to cover the NFL believe the Bucs are a massive favorite to win the NFC South, despite being tied with the Falcons and Atlanta owning the head-to-head tiebreaker. That was the consensus on the Football Night In America panel last night, which included ex-quarterback and head coach Jason Garrett, former All-Pro defensive back Devin McCourty, fantasy guru Matthew Berry (Joe’s not a fan) and NBC super insider and ProFootballTalk.com guru Mike Florio. All were asked rate the Bucs’ shot at winning the division from 1 t0 10. Each chose a number 7.5 or greater. Joe’s point here is not what each guy said about the Buccaneers, but the overriding evalution that the Bucs are the best team in the NFC South with the best chance to win the title. That represents expectations on the head of Todd Bowles, and rightfully so.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/gerald-mccoy-complaining-bucs-fans-are-spoiled/|Gerald McCoy: Complaining Bucs Fans Are “Spoiled”|Once upon a time in The Lost Decade of Buccaneers football, Tampa Bay was the 2024 Panthers, seizing losses from the jaws of victory.  Overtime in Tampa against the Raiders comes to mind in 2016. Somehow, the Bucs lost that day with the Raiders committing 23 penalties. Those Lost Decade teams were masters at finding ways to lose. Why? Because the Bucs’ culture and what crafts a winner wasn’t there. Six-time Bucs Pro Bowl defensive tackle Gerald McCoy, a prominent face of The Lost Decade, lectured fans on this subject today on WDAE radio. McCoy remains a hardcore Bucs fan and rode the rollercoaster during yesterday’s insane overtime win against the Panthers, even troubling an airplane passenger sitting next to him as he watched. For McCoy, Bucs fans today pointing fingers at Todd Bowles are “spoiled,” he said. Those fans don’t realize that the Bucs used to be that loser team finding another way to lose, McCoy said. Yesterday, he said, the Bucs were the winning franchise finding a way to squeak out a tough road win and go home. That’s what good teams do, per McCoy, and he noted his happiness for guys like Will Gholston, Lavonte David and Mike Evans, who understand what it’s like to work with him within an opposite team culture. McCoy acknowledged that he really doesn’t know what it’s like to play as the favorite, the perennial playoff team with great expectations. No, McCoy was not claiming the Bucs played well and are a dangerous Super Bowl contender. It was just a franchise great — and a current fan — feeling compelled to share his take on what’s driving a lot of Bucs fans to extreme frustration this morning.|2024-12-02 11:22:00|285|91|7|Gerald McCoy|"McCoy calls out complaining fans as ""spoiled"" amidst Bucs success."|4|Fans express frustration, criticism, and concern about team performance and coaching decisions.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""bucnjim"", ""post"": ""Some fans have little patience and this includes myself as well.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/bucky-irving-rachaad-whites-success-is-my-success/|Bucky Irving: Rachaad White’s Success Is My Success|Joe thinks it is fairly obvious by now that Bucky Irving is the best running back the Bucs have drafted since Doug Martin, maybe not since Cadillac Williams. Irving has really melded himself into a real weapon but still seems to be a part-time cog in the Bucs offense. And Irving has no problem with that. The way he looks at it, wins are the goal and if a teammate helps the Bucs win, everybody wins, Irving said this morning at One Buc Palace. “In our [running backs] room, all of our success is one,” Irving said. “If I’m having success, everybody in our room is having success. “To see your brother out there [Rachaad White], I have his back. I couldn’t be out there at the time. I got faith in Rachaad. He’s a great guy, for sure. “He’s a guy that can make explosive plays. We all are capable of doing it.” Irving ran for 152 yards on 25 carries, averaging 6.1 yards a carry. Very impressive. However, Irving suffered what Bucs coach Todd Bowles deemed a hip-pointer yesterday, which may be one reason why White was the Bucs’ running back on the game-winning drive in overtime. There is video out there of Irving walking to the Bucs’ locker room with ice wrapped around his midsection after the win hollering, “F’ no!” after being asked if he was OK. Irving added he felt much better this morning. That doesn’t mean he will practice this week or be able to play when the Bucs host the Raiders on Sunday.|2024-12-02 10:25:00|260|36|7|Bucky Irving|Team player mentality|7|Positive comments and optimism about Bucky Irvin, mixed with concerns about injuries and play-calling.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Couch Fan"", ""post"": ""I loved the way Cadi Ran the ball.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/baker-mayfield-admits-his-injury-scared-him/|Baker Mayfield Admits His Injury Scared Him|For a guy who is a warrior competitor willing to play with pain and do whatever he must to help his team win, it’s a helluva confession to admit he was scared on the field. But that’s just what Baker Mayfield admitted to after yesterday’s win against the Panthers. Mayfield had the ankle on his plant foot, his right foot, stomped on by Jadeveon Clowney. At the time, Mayfield didn’t know what happened because he was on the ground while being sacked. What Mayfield thought happened was a blown Achilles. “Honestly, it scared the daylights out of me,” Mayfield said. “I have seen some people pop their Achilles before and they say it feels like you get cleated in the back. Obviously not knowing what exactly happened, that’s what I thought it did. “It was a little painful, but, yeah, got taped up again and go back out there. Now I’m the idiot that went in on a third and one. Took Kyle Trask out, and threw a pick right to [Xavier Woods] chest but we found a way to win.” Joe cannot blame Mayfield for that pick. Why? He shouldn’t have been put in that position. Bucs offensive coordinator Liam Coen should have waited for Kyle Trask to get that first down on 3rd-and-1. Or if Coen absolutely, positively had to have Mayfield on the field, then have Bucky Irving run for it. That decision right there damn near cost the Bucs their season. Thankfully, the defense put up a stand and held Carolina to a field goal in what became an overtime game.|2024-12-02 09:00:00|265|32|4|Baker Mayfield|Mayfield admits fear after scary injury scare in game.|4|Mixed sentiments with criticism towards coaching decisions and defense, praise for Mayfield's late-game performance.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Bee"", ""post"": ""Not scary enough to not go back in the game and immediately turn it over.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/13-of-32-nfl-teams-have-winning-records/|13 Of 32 NFL Teams Have Winning Records|There’s a reason for the old cliché, “It’s tough to win in the NFL.” For the struggling Bucs fans wanting to defecate in Todd Bowles’ Christmas stocking after yesterday’s game, Joe feels compelled to share that the Tampa Bay sky is not falling. The Bucs are like the vast majority NFL teams. They’re scratching and clawing just to get in the win column. Only 13 clubs now have winning records. Fourteen will make the playoffs. The Bucs have plenty of company in mediocrity and a fantastic chance to win their division for the fourth consecutive season — or a great chance to reach the playoffs for the fifth straight year. That’s nothing to celebrate, but it’s nothing to freak out about, either. Joe’s not defending the Todd Bowles brand of football, but Joe also realizes Bowles is the best head coach in the NFC South and maybe better than most around the league. Again, the Bucs don’t look good, but it’s all relative. The Joe typing here is prepared to eat pizza today and relax, waiting to see how the Bucs finish the season. The current Bucs are one game worse after 12 games than they were during their Super Bowl year with Tom Brady. And they’re one game better than they were last year after 12 games. There’s still time for the arrow to point straight up, just like it was after the Bucs were literally one play from losing to dismal Desmond Ridder last December, and after the Bucs needed a forced-fumble miracle from Antoine Winfield Jr. to beat the tanking Panthers last January. Winning is the only goal. Getting there isn’t always pretty. And anything less than 10 this season remains unacceptable.|2024-12-02 08:59:00|285|26|6|13 Of 32 NFL Teams Have Winning Records|Bucs mediocrity and optimism.|2|Mixed opinions on coaching, defensive issues, injuries, and performance with some hope shown.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Jack Sparrow"", ""post"": ""Don\u2019t put a lot of emotions in this Bucs Team.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/did-the-bucs-play-without-heart/|Did The Bucs Play Without Heart?|Joe didn’t expect Todd Bowles to pull a Bobby Knight yesterday. Joe recalls too many times to count that Knight, the former basketball warlord of Indiana, even after a win, would be enraged over the play of his players and he considered the win a loss in reality. And, as well documented in “Season on the Brink” those wins that felt like losses were treated as losses and Knight’s team would have hell to pay in practice. Bowles is not a Knight-like creature. He praised the fight his team showed against the Stinking Panthers. And, Joe doesn’t think Bowles was wrong, he said that in the first half of the season, the Bucs would have tucked their tails between their legs and hid and not fight back. Then, Bowles, per his transcribed comments by Carolina’s media relations staff, seemed to admit his players didn’t play with heart, or at least not enough heart, yesterday. “We just gotta come ready to play and make less mistakes and our hearts into it. We got to clean up some things, we know that,” Bowles said. Well, the Bucs, at least not enough, sure didn’t look like they played with heart. Anthony Nelson is one player who certainly did have heart. But how could they not have played with heart? Were the Bucs somehow unaware of the stakes at hand? Did they not know Atlanta lost yesterday? Did they not know a win would put the Bucs one game behind in the chase for the NFC South crown? (Atlanta has the tiebreaker over the Bucs). Joe just cannot understand that. With so much to gain with a win, a win over a trash team, a division rival, the Bucs came out like it was their 14th training camp practice. Has the mental or spiritual pilot light for winning or for making the playoffs gone out with this team?|2024-12-02 07:00:00|314|45|2|The Bucs|Bucs disappointing performance without sufficient heart.|3|Mixed sentiment with some criticism and praise, overall leaning towards negativity.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Mike C"", ""post"": ""This is the second youngest team in the league\u2026\u2026.. if you can\u2019t understand that they largely are still learning on the job, I can\u2019t help you."", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""2nd,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""7:18"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""SB~LV"", ""post"": ""\ud83e\udd2e\ud83e\udd2e\ud83e\udd2e\ud83e\udd2e\ud83e\udd2e\ud83e\udd2e"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""2nd,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""7:19"", ""am""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""Jmarkbuc"", ""post"": ""Maybe do something other than walk through practices all week.. every week."", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""2nd,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""7:19"", ""am""]}, ""commenter3"": {""username"": ""MJ"", ""post"": ""there are no trash teams in the nfl- on any given sunday bryce young is not the same qb he used to be and their d came to play"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""2nd,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""7:25"", ""am""]}, ""commenter4"": {""username"": ""JonBucsfan"", ""post"": ""If I had a nickel\u2026.."", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""2nd,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""7:28"", ""am""]}, ""commenter5"": {""username"": ""SB~LV"", ""post"": ""There have been several heartless games this year and last\u2026"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""2nd,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""7:41"", ""am""]}, ""commenter6"": {""username"": ""Seanbuc76"", ""post"": ""Thank goodness for that improved run game kudos to Liam Cohen, the offensive line, and bucky Irving and company they won the game today baker didn\u2019t play his best and the defense was, well, the defense\u2026 the play of the SEASON goes to Anthony Nelson he\u2019s literally single handedly kept us in contention with one play\u2013 the o-line has a huge task on their hands this coming weekend with crosby let\u2019s hope we keep this rolling along"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""2nd,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""7:49"", ""am""]}, ""commenter7"": {""username"": ""Bobby M."", ""post"": ""The Bucs have taken on the persona of Bowles\u2026..this team needs a coach that lights a fire under their rears.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/bucs-postseason-probability-jumps-to-58-percent/|Bucs’ Postseason Probability Jumps To 58 Percent|Anyone else remember how the Bucs needed witchcraft and a miracle forced fumble to beat the Panthers last year in Week 18 to make the playoffs? Joe sure does.  That’s football. It’s not good, inspiring football when your team struggles against the dregs of the league with everything on the line. But it’s still the NFL. Crazy things happen to every team, good and bad. Joe doesn’t recall Bucs fans sitting around bars last spring talking about how the Bucs were one Rachaad White fourth-down run in December — aka a Falcons missed tackle — from losing in Atlanta to dismal Desmond Ridder and missing the playoffs. No, fans talked all spring about the Bucs taking the Lions to the brink in Round 2 of the playoffs. So “this Joe” isn’t about to do much today but celebrate a sweet victory againt a hated division rival yesterday. And per NFL.com calculations, the Bucs, down one of the best receivers in the NFL, Chris Godwin, now have a 58 percent chance of reaching the postseason. Atlanta’s magic percentage sits at 57 percent. That’s right, “57.” The Athletic/New York Times data models also show the Bucs with a 58 percent chance of the reaching the playoffs. They have Atlanta at 63 percent. The exciting thing for those who want to see the Bucs playing a big game in January is how much the Bucs’ Wild Card chances have jumped. They’re in a strong tiebreaker position after yesterday’s win, if they end up tied with multiple teams at a 10-7 record.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/five-things-80/|Five Things|Welcome to a hollow Victory Monday. Yeah, a win is a win, in theory. And the standings. But man, there was nothing winning about that game yesterday. Coffee mugs full? OK, let’s go. Misleading W One thing Joe always hopes his readers understand is Joe is always authentic with readers. Always has been, always will be. Joe types what he sees, what he feels. If that ticks off some people, whether it is readers or those who work behind closed doors at One Buc Palace, it doesn’t matter to Joe. As Joe’s very first editor said when Joe wrote his first sports story for pay, “Write what you see.” And here’s what “this Joe” saw yesterday: A loss. Yes, yes, Joe knows the Bucs got a win. There was nothing winning about that game. “This Joe” has never felt like the Bucs lost after a win. Until last night. Joe has never felt angry about a Bucs win. Until last night. No relief. No happiness. Just an overall sense of disgust and disappointment, almost how Joe felt after the Bucs choked away a win on a Thursday night in Atlanta. The only thing redeeming about yesterday was a W in the standings. The Bucs looked like losers, played like losers, gagged like losers and looked like they were coached with a losing mentality. With the exception of Mike Evans, Chase McLaughlin, Anthony Nelson and Bucky Irving, everything about that game yesterday was an L. Except for the W. Joe just cannot believe that was the effort the Bucs had when they found out before kickoff all they had to do was win and they would be tied with Atlanta. Instead, the Bucs sleepwalked through the game. Played like they were scared. Coached like they were trying to conserve energy and play not to get hurt. Any other team than the lowly Stinking Panthers and the Bucs would have had their doors blown off instead of clawing to a gift of a win in overtime. This is the team that is supposed to go to the playoffs? This is the team that is supposed to run the table to clinch a division title? This is a team that can afford one loss and still make the playoffs? Playoffs? If the Bucs play and coach like they did yesterday, they’re going to lose three more games. Playoffs? Play like that? Playoffs? Ha! Bucky? Stud. Evans? Hall of Famer (what’s new?). McLaughlin? Best kicker Bucs have ever had. Nelson? He played with an unmatched heart. The rest? The way they played, they looked more like a team that has the U-Haul backed up in their driveway ready to hit the DR the first week of January. How Could They Play So Low? Joe is trying to wrap his head around the following: The Bucs knew they were about to put themselves a step away from making an improbable comeback in the standings. After the Bucs lost to San Francisco to send them into a bye week, only fans with the thickest pewter-colored glasses believed this team was an NFC South champ this fall. Yet thanks to Atlanta choking badly and the Bucs putting their foot on the throats of the Giants, suddenly the seas parted. Where was that heart, that passion, that intensity yesterday that the Bucs displayed in New Jersey the prior week? It was almost as if the Bucs figured they’d just get dressed, scratch their arses and Carolina would lay down and roll over. There is hardly a starter with the Stinking Panthers that could start for the Bucs. Old man Adam Thielen probably, only because Chris Godwin is hurt. Josey Jewell probably. Maybe Jaycee Horn. That’s about it. To think of all that was at stake yesterday for the Bucs to come out and play like that, geez. Joe is starting to think this team needs a good, healthy dose of discipline, not giving dudes a day off today, the NFL version of taking the grade school team to Dairy Queen. Instead, the Bucs ought to have a fully-padded practice today at 7 a.m. after that shatfest. Coaches Were Awful If Todd Bowles really believes it’s best for Jamel Dean to stand in another area code while some third-rate receiver is able to haul in passes in front of him time after time, then maybe the game has passed Bowles by. And if Bowles doesn’t like what Dean is doing, why doesn’t he bench him until he adjusts accordingly? If Bowles allows it, that means he wants it. It’s a bad look for Dean; a worse look for Bowles. Really Liam Coen? Joe thought surely you were one of the best offensive coordinators in the game. Have a hurt Baker Mayfield and his numb ankle on his plant foot (fresh from the peep show tent) come off the bench on third-and-one to try a pass when you could have handed the ball off to Irving? Only to watch Mayfield throw a pick? Don’t trust Trask with a short pass? Unfathomable! That very, nearly cost the Bucs their season right there. The Bucs played like they were Bishop Sycamore, where the fraudulent high school team was nothing more than a barnstorming team of college wannabes playing three games a week. The Bucs looked like they played on both Thanksgiving Day, and on Sunday. Joe’s going to type the following and be done with it: If the Bucs play like they did yesterday against the Raiders next weekend, then the Raiders will stomp their arse. The Raiders, unlike the Stinking Panthers, have some talent. Hey Bucs, you may not be aware, but maybe, just maybe, you can afford just one more loss the next five games. Time to act like you know it. Time to start playing with urgency and fire. Time to quit waiting on accidents to save the day. Lacking Pass Rush It seems if Calijah Kancey and Vita Vea cannot get to the quarterback, the Bucs are not getting to the quarterback. There are times, like yesterday, the way Kancey flies through the line, he looks like No. 99 to Joe (and no, Joe is not referring to Aaron Donald who never played for the Bucs!). Kancey has been on fire of late. He now has five sacks in his last four games and six for the season in seven games. Vita was on fire, too, but he was stoned by Carolina yesterday. So basically the Bucs’ pass rush was Kancey and, well, just Kancey. It is appallingly irresponsible how Bucs coaches don’t care about sacks from an edge rush. And frankly, Joe’s deep well of patience on this subject has run dry. This utter nonsense is going to catch up with the Bucs in the next two months. It very nearly caught up with them yesterday. Pray Lavonte David Stays Upright So starting linebacker K.J. Britt blew out his ankle in the second quarter and was lost for the game. The already thinner-than-thin inside linebacker corps is even worse off. Alongside Bucs veteran stud Lavonte David, there is J.J. Russell and Vi Jones. All you need to know about Jones is he was signed by the Bucs a year ago and as recently as a few weeks ago, Bucs coach Todd Bowles said he wasn’t ready yet (though he played yesterday). He’s been on the roster/practice squad for a year and he wasn’t ready??? What exactly were the Bucs teaching him, to remove kidney stones with a pocket knife? If Bowles’ defense is truly this complicated that a guy can be with the team for a year but deemed unready, that may explain why so many dudes are making so many mistakes. Perhaps Bowles’ defense is overly complex and may have to be dialed back a little. What is this Jones doing during meetings, playing video poker on his phone with Kwon Alexander? Anyway, if David somehow, God forbid, gets hurt, this Bucs defense may be doomed.|2024-12-02 05:00:00|1330|70|4|Five Things|Hollow Victory Monday Bucs analysis post-game.|3|Mixed reactions, concern about coaching, inconsistency, some optimism about future improvements.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Mike C"", ""post"": ""Joe\u2026..

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/bill-belichick-intimate-floats-his-name-to-bucs/|Bill Belichick Intimate Floats His Name To Bucs|Last week there seemed for Joe to be unusual chatter from a respected league insider that linked currently unemployed six-time Super Bowl-winning coach Bill Belichick to the Bucs. At the time, the Bucs were in the midst of a four-game losing streak. The Bucs snapped that a week ago with a resounding win over the Giants yet a member of Belichick’s inner circle floated his name to the Bucs, provided there is a coach’s opening. And that member of Belichick’s inner circle is former NFL suit Michael Lombardi. How close is Lombardi with Belichick? Well, Lombardi works with Belichick on the ex-coach’s podcast right now. He also worked for Belichick in both Cleveland and New England. Also, Belichick hired Lombardi’s son, Mick, as an offensive assistant coach in New England. Further, Joe heard Lombardi say on his podcast, “GM Shuffle,” that one late spring weekend afternoon he heard a knock on his door. It was Belichick. He was sailing his boat south from Boston to Florida and he docked in Ocean City, N.J. to spend time with his former colleague. So yeah, he knows Belichick rather well. Last week on “Mad Dog Radio,” featured on SiriusXM Radio, the one and only Chris “Mad Dog” Russo hosted Lombardi for their weekly gambling spot. There, Russo asked Lombardi if Belichick would return to coaching next year and where may he land? That’s when Lombardi said don’t count out the Bucs. Chris “Mad Dog” Russo: Will Belichick coach next year and if so where? What’s the most likely spot? Michael Lombardi: Ah, I would definetly think he will coach next year. I really think that is probably in the cards. I think there is a lot of interest in him so far. My initial guess would be Jacksonville but that is strictly just a guess. … Look, I think there are going to be some jobs that we are not even talking about that could potentially be open. I think Tampa Bay, if they don’t keep winning, could open up. I think that could be a possibility [for Belichick] because I know how much he likes Baker. This is all very interesting to Joe. And yes, Joe knows Todd Bowles is very much employed by Team Glazer. If the Bucs make the playoffs, Joe doesn’t think the odds are good that Bowles would be replaced. And every win Bowles might have in the playoffs strengthens his job security. This wasn’t the first time Joe heard that Belichick likes Baker Mayfield. Earlier this year on the weekly NFL Films show “Inside the NFL,” Mayfield’s name came up in conversation. Belichick beamed and said, “I love Baker Mayfield.” Any veteran coach looking for an NFL gig wants a built-in, veteran starting quarterback. Especially a guy in his 70s like Belichick. Again, Joe isn’t saying Bowles is done with the Bucs. Or that the Bucs plan to move on or should. It’s just very curious that twice in the past week Joe heard respected NFL insiders link Belichick’s name to the Bucs, despite no opening. Currently.|2024-12-02 04:59:00|510|44|7|Bill Belichick|Belichick linked to possible coaching role with Bucs|2|Mixed feelings towards Bowles, potential interest in Belichick, concerns about defense and coaching staff.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""FortMyersDave"", ""post"": ""Shula has 347 wins, the Hoodie has 333 and given Belichick\u2019s ego, it is not a far reach he wants to coach a few more seasons (2 or 3) to get that record.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/this-time-the-bucs-got-a-break-with-lack-of-a-boundary-angle/|This Time The Bucs Got A Break With No Boundary Angle|Earlier this year when the Bucs hosted the Dixie Chicks, Antoine Winfield sure looked as if he stripped Atlanta tight end Kyle Pitts of the football before he reached the goal line. But the touchdown ruling on the field stood. Why? FOX had no pylon cameras on the goal line. As a result, the zebras couldn’t get a decent view of the play proving Pitts lost control of the ball before he crossed the goal line. Without irrefutable evidence, the play stood. Touchdown Dixie Chicks. Atlanta would go on to win 31-26. Now, the Bucs are in a dogfight with the Dixie Chicks, tied in the NFC South race with 6-6 records. In part because of that call, Atlanta has a tiebreaker over the Bucs. Well, the Bucs got paid back yesterday. Late in the first half, Adam Thielen appeared to have caught a touchdown from Bryce Young in the back of the end zone. The zebras ruled an incomplete pass as they said Thielen bobbled the ball. Every replay FOX had showed Thielen caught the ball, bobbled it, appeared to regain control and then the rest of the play was obscured either by Thielen’s body or the field goal post structure. The replay officials saw the same thing. With no clear angle that Thielen regained control, there wasn’t evidence to overturn the call. Carolina had to settle for a field goal. That’s three points the play may have cost Carolina. Given the fact the game went into overtime, that turned out to be a huge call in favor of the Bucs. Pool reporter Joe Person interviewed NFL vice president of replay Mark Butterworth after the game to get the upside of the lowdown. “The ruling on the field was incomplete and the officials were giving the bobble signal,” Butterworth explained. “We purposely stopped the game. For us to overturn, we need clear and obvious video evidence to change the ruling on the field. “As we looked at available views, there was an initial bobble while the receiver was in the air. He then did get control which is the first part of the catch process. He did get a knee inbounds and as he is going to the ground, the third act would be surviving the ground. “As he goes to the ground and turns over, there was no shot showing that he maintained possession throughout completing the process of the catch. On one of the angles – and there were not a lot of available angles and we didn’t have a shot to overturn it – as he is rolling over, you can see at least one hand come off the ball. So with an on-field ruling of incomplete, we would have to show that he had control to award him a touchdown.” And maybe, just maybe, the Bucs, once possibly doomed because of no pyloncam, might be saved because of no pyloncam. So it may, just may, all even out for the Bucs in their quest for a playoff berth. Why the NFL does not mandate all boundaries be covered by pyloncams or some other camera seems incredibly irresponsible for a league worth hundreds of billions of dollars.|2024-12-02 04:00:00|531|18|5|Bucs|Game-changing calls favoring the Bucs in crucial moments.|4|Mixed opinions on the ruling, some feel lucky, others see it differently.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Leopold Stotch"", ""post"": ""I thought it was 6, was stunned it wasn\u2019t."", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""2nd,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""4:20"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""dbbuc711"", ""post"": ""Or since there was a ref right on top of the play who made the call Theilan really did not actually have total control of the ball and it was not a touchdown.

The first was Anthony Nelson’s strip of Chuba Hubbard that YaYa Diaby pounced on in overtime when it seemed the game was over. All the Stinking Panthers had to do was kick a chip shot field goal and the Bucs’ season would have been shot. But no! Nelson gets an improbable strip, Diaby hangs on for dear life, and in the blink of an eye, it was Chase McLaughlin who kicked a game-winning field goal for the Tampa Bay. And then there was the postgame hassle. As you can see in the clip below, Nelson — he and his wife had a baby last week — was treated like royalty when he showed up in the Bucs’ locker room and was given a gameball. But Todd Bowles didn’t stop there. Bowles was so giddy he announced he would see the Bucs next on Wednesday. The Bucs got the day off today!

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/baker-mayfield-in-a-boot/|Baker Mayfield In A Boot|This is very likely just precautionary, as Baker Mayfield returned to the game and sure didn’t play like he had a sprained ankle or worse. Long-time Panthers beat guy Joe Person, who now covers the team for The Athletic, Twittered out last night that Mayfield was walking around the Bucs’ locker room wearing a boot on his right foot. That’s the same foot stomped on by Jadeveon Clowney in the second half of the game. Mayfield missed two plays while being evaluated and treated in the peep show tent. Joe guesses Mayfield will be a very sort MOFO today. And it wouldn’t shock Joe if Mayfield misses a practice or two.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/mike-evans-needs-485-yards-to-keep-streak-alive/|Mike Evans Needs 479 Yards To Keep Streak Alive|Mike Evans has never not had 1,000 yards receiving in a season. To do this for his 11th straight year, he’s going to take it down to the wire. Just like his team did yesterday in Charlotte. Evans had 118 yards receiving yesterday, his biggest game since his monster performance against the Lions in the playoffs. It included a circus catch of a touchdown grab that turned out to be oh-so vital. Evans also made a crazy catch of a ball thrown behind him. Simply put, even at 31, Evans demonstrated when he’s healthy he’s still one of the best receivers in the game. He’s going to the Pro Football Hall of Fame someday. But an 11th-straight season breaking Jerry Rice’s mark of 10 straight 1,000-yard seasons could seal the deal for him on a first ballot. Evans now has 521 yards this season, needing 479 to hit 1,000. With five games left, he must average 96 yards a game. Keep Baker Mayfield upright and stop people from stomping on his plant foot and Evans may just pull this off. Sort of the way yesterday the Bucs snatched victory out of the teeth of defeat.  |2024-12-02 00:00:00|195|14|8|Mike Evans|Evans aims to continue 1|4|Mixed sentiment with doubts about record-breaking potential despite some positive comments.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Itzok"", ""post"": ""He\u2019s not getting the streak.
