https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/jags-afer-mike-greenberg/|Jags After Mike Greenberg|UPDATED 7:15 p.m. Bucs AC/DC-loving general manager Jason Licht is in a pinch. Already down one of his right-hand men, John Spytek, who now works for Tom Brady in Las Vegas, Licht may lose his other trusted colleague. Assistant general manager Mike Greenberg is now a target of the Jags to become their next general manager alongside new Jags chief football czar Tony Boselli, the Hall of Fame offensive lineman. Peter Schrager of NFL Network reported the Jags asked the Bucs for permission to interview Greenberg. This is a tough one for Licht. He’s tight with Greenberg and wants to see Greenberg get a chance to run a team. But that one? Jacksonville? That would hurt. The Jags twice last week tied to interview Bucs assistant coaches and both times the Jags got shot down by Tampa Bay. Teams cannot block employees from interviewing for promotions. Tough one. Jags owner Shad Con Khan said new Jags head coach Liam Coen, Boselli and the next general manager will “form a football leadership unit that will collaborate and align on all major football decisions, develop long-term strategy for sustained on-field success and provide counsel to the team owner.”|2025-02-03 18:53:00|196|60|6|Mike Greenberg|Bucs face loss of assistant GM to Jaguars.|4|Mixed reactions to staff changes and Greenberg's potential promotion, concerns about loyalty and future success.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Leopold Stotch"", ""post"": ""See this is why HOW someone leaves is important.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/todd-bowles-to-emphasize-third-down-defense-in-2025/|Todd Bowles To Emphasize Third Down Defense In 2025|This may really surprise Bucs fans but not even Todd Bowles will be happy with this. The Bucs coach, in his final media availability of the 2024 season the day after the Bucs lost to Washington, was very focused on one element of his defense that didn’t get the job done. Third down defense. And despite Bowles rightly being irked, the Bucs weren’t horrendous on third downs if you look at the season in the big picture. In the small picture (playoff loss to Washington), it was atrocious. The Bucs never forced one punt in the playoff loss to Washington. Not one! The Bucs did get off the field on two fourth-downs when Washington couldn’t convert. Still, it was a playoff game and your opposing punter could have just stayed home or sat with Bucs fans and pounded beers in the south end zone, that’s inexcusable. Bowles all but vowed that will change this fall. “It’s doing the little things right – not turning the ball over, getting off the field on third down,” Bowles said of what must change in 2025. “Those are the little things that happened all year that came up at the end. We had a good stretch defensively at playing third downs – didn’t play them well [against Washington].” In 2024, the Bucs finished in the middle of the pack in third down defense holding opponents to a 39 percent conversion percentage. That was good/bad enough for 15th place. It would help if Bowles can somehow, someway find some inner-strength, bite the bullet and come to grips with the fact that the Bucs cannot succeed in the postseason without an effective edge rusher. It would also help if his well-compensated cornerback can stay on the field in the postseason for a change.|2025-02-03 10:30:00|297|117|4|Todd Bowles|Bowles emphasizes third down defense after playoff disappointment.|2|Mixed responses on defensive strategies, desire for Myles Garrett, skepticism about team's ability.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Buc4evr"", ""post"": ""Bucs simply do not have the players on defense to stop better teams on 3rd or even 4th downs.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/what-if-4/|What If… ?|So most of NFL media is descending or has descended on New Orleans today or yesterday. Tonight is Super Bowl Week’s Opening Night. And thus, Super Bowl Week officially begins. Of course, national sports shows and podcasts will already be set up and airing from New Orleans today. Buckle up. Over at The Athletic, James Boyd and Austin Mock decided to cobble together a “What if… ?” column. With one of their “What ifs… ?” makes it easy to say Joe already would be in New Orleans because the Bucs would be NFC champions. What if the Bucs had beaten the Commandos? The Bucs were “this close” to beating Washington. It took a doink of a field goal for the Commandos to win. The next week the Commandos thrashed the Lions. The Bucs already had beaten the Lions and you could argue the Lions, due to injuries, had a worse defense than the Bucs’. Then, the Commandos lost to the Eagles in the NFC title game. The Bucs also beat the Eagles this season. And Bucs coach Todd Bowles and his defense always give Jalen Hurts fits. So yeah, the “What if… ?” from The Athletic duo is a painful one. The Bucs could have had a glorious postseason if not for that nasty close playoff loss.|2025-02-03 07:00:00|217|57|5|What If... ?|Super Bowl Week speculation on missed playoff opportunities.|1|Fans express frustration and speculation over team's performance and potential, mixed with optimism.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""ATLBucSolar"", ""post"": ""The Bucs could have had a glorious postseason if not for that nasty Baker Mayfield fumble this year and the season ending interception last year."", ""post_time"": [""ATLBucSolar""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Mike C"", ""post"": ""Played both Super Bowl teams this year, if only we had a competitive football team in Tampa\u2026\u2026.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/mina-kimes-bucs-offense-will-make-josh-grizzard-look-good/|Mina Kimes: Bucs Offense Will Make Josh Grizzard Look Good|Joe has written a couple of times — half-jokingly, half-serious — wondering where new Bucs offensive coordinator Josh Grizzard will be a head coach next year. The last three Bucs offensive coordinators have experienced extremes in their careers the last three seasons. Either the offensive coordinator has had his arse canned and can’t find another job or he’s been hired as a head coach. Nothing in-between. Feast or famine. BSPN football analyst Mina Kimes, on her podcast last week recorded just hours before Grizzard was promoted, noted whomever got the job would look good because there are no weak spots on the offense (provided the Bucs bring back Chris Godwin). “It’s like the perfect job for a coordinator to get a lot of credit, because it’s like a good offensive line, a quarterback that people think is good — not great, really good. “We’ll see with Chris Godwin. That’s an interesting one, but Jalen McMillian was really awesome for them. Bucky Irving was awesome. Mike Evans is still Mike Evans, so I’m not worried about the offense.” Nor should Bucs fans. Joe believes now that Bucky Irving has a year of NFL under his belt, he will be better. Joe doesn’t think the same expectation is wrong for Jalen McMillan. He should be better. Grizzard will be learning on the job, just like Dave Canales did in 2023. Canales’ two biggest problems were scoring a touchdown on the opening drive — just the opposite of Liam Coen — and Canales was way too hung up on running up the middle time and again. And still Canales had the Bucs a play and a two-point conversation from pushing the mighty Lions to overtime in the playoffs. Kimes isn’t wrong. The offense should still be good. The offense has the players to bail out Grizzard if he makes some errors. The defense, specifically the pass defense, must be fixed. That’s all there is to it.|2025-02-03 03:45:00|323|24|5|Mina Kimes|Bucs offense praised|6|Comments are mixed, hopeful on offense but critical of defense and coaching decisions.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Aqualung"", ""post"": ""Most agree and hope the pass defense gets fixed.

[The Athletic] Matt Rhule and the NCAA need to get their acts together. Rhule wants to get rid of Nebraska spring games because he says his players get poached after other coaches watch the games. Well, those spring games are major revenue producers (Joe has a hunch that FOX/B1G Network has it in their contract that schools must televise spring games). Gotta have funds to pay for players. First it was dudes leaving teams in the playoffs and now it’s spring games being canceled.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/mike-evans-details-one-reason-why-josh-grizzard-will-succeed/|Mike Evans Details One Reason Josh Grizzard Will Succeed|Roughly a week before Christmas, then-Bucs offensive coordinator Liam Coen told the NFL world that the success of the Bucs on third downs was largely because of one man. The Bucs led the NFL in third down conversions, which is a tremendous feat. Coen said look no further than passing game coordinator Josh Grizzard. Coen explained Grizzard’s sphere of influence was crafting third-down plays. And the reason the Bucs did so well on those plays is because Grizzard knows what he is doing. Yesterday at the Pro Bowl practice, Mike Evans explained that is why he believes Grizzard will have success as the Bucs’ new offensive coordinator. “Very big point of emphasis — obviously Josh did the third down meetings last year,” Evans said. “We were very locked in to the games [as a result of] those third down meetings. We knew what was coming.” So, Evans said, the Bucs similarly will be locked in not just on third downs, but all downs this fall. Joe didn’t get the impression the Bucs weren’t locked in on first and second downs. But it seems like the Bucs were laser-focused on third downs. And a large reason, per Evans, was Grizzard.|2025-02-03 00:00:00|199|15|8|Josh Grizzard|Evans praises Grizzard's impact on Bucs' third down success|6|Overall, mixed sentiment with some optimism and excitement, but also concerns and critical remarks.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""firethecannons"", ""post"": ""So good to hear this, thanks Joe!
