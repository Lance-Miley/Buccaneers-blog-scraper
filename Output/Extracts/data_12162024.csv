https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/the-bucs-kicked-tail-on-third-downs/|The Bucs Kicked Tail On Third Downs|One only needs to read one stat to know the Bucs took a frozen lead pipe to the Chargers yesterday in a dicey Los Angeles back alley. And this stat makes any other stat pale in comparison — except the score. The Bucs defense, with Salvation Army volunteers playing safety (thankfully they left their bells at Publix), shut out the Chargers on third downs. You read that right: Los Angeles’ third down conversion rate was zero percent. Noda. None. They were 0-6 on third downs. Even better for the Bucs, the two times the Chargers went for it on fourth down (obviously encouraged by BSPN Analytics), the Bucs’ defense stoned the mighty Chargers. That, folks, is playing defense. And unless a team is the 1999 Rams,  the 1984 49ers or perhaps the 2020 Bucs, if you can’t convert a third down, you aren’t winning. The teams Joe mentioned? Those offenses were so potent they didn’t need third downs to convert.|2024-12-16 15:00:00|160|35|9|The Bucs|Dominant defensive performance on third downs.|7|Fans are optimistic and proud of the defense, but there are some criticisms and frustrations.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Upstate NY BUC"", ""post"": ""Been a Buc fan along time never saw that stat, amazing if you really think about it!

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/elite-scriptwriters/|Elite Scriptwriters|So the Bucs lead the NFL in one objective statistic that has mesmerized the exiled chieftain of the PFF Tribe (Pro Football Focus). Sam Monson and his data partner Steve Pallazolo ran from the Tribe to pitch their tent at The33rdTeam.com. They host a show for the outfit and it’s the same stats-heavy chatter they used to do share for PFF. Today, Monson seemed obsessed with the Bucs being the best first-quarter team in the NFL. And in Monson’s mind, that’s offense and defense, as the Bucs have the best points differential in the NFL in the first quarter. Ironically, the mightly Eagles, winners of 10 consecutive games, are a horrible first-quarter team. Perhaps this is one reason why the Bucs have owned Philadelphia, in addition to QB Jalen Hurts’ miserable performances against Todd Bowles defenses? As for the Bucs’ early success in games, Monson credited Todd Bowles and playcaller Liam Coen, but acknowledged that Coen has cracked a code in impressive fashion. Yesterday, per Joe’s addition, was the Bucs’ seventh opening-drive touchdown of the season. The Bucs have won all of those games. Of course, the Bowles are a poor second-quarter team statistically, but nobody can say Bowles doesn’t know how to get a team ready for kickoff. If he can only figure out how to ease the Bucs’ mid-game slides, Tampa Bay might become a Super Bowl contender in a hurry.|2024-12-16 14:58:00|233|27|7|Elite Scriptwriters|Bucs' impressive first-quarter dominance against Eagles and potential Super Bowl contention.|5|Mixed sentiment with some optimism towards team potential but also concerns and skepticism.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""GoneGator"", ""post"": ""If we could just skip the 2nd quarter we\u2019d be unbeatable \ud83e\udd23"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""16th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""3:09"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Lt.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/gold-jacket/|“Gold Jacket”|Bucs stud left tackle Tristan Wirfs has some words for world-renowned JoeBucsFan.com columnist Ira Kaufman, or whomever replaces Ira as Tampa Bay’s selector to the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Bucs future Hall of Famer Mike Evans just keeps racking up the numbers. Per NFL Research by way of Kevin Patra of NFL.com, with another 150+ yards and two-touchdowns game yesterday, Evans is now in very elite NFL company. NFL Research: Mike Evans earned his seventh career game with 150-plus receiving yards and multiple receiving TDs, which is fourth-most in NFL history — trails Jerry Rice (17), Don Maynard and Tyreek Hill (8 each). Though Joe just learned of this late last night, it wouldn’t surprise left tackle Tristan Wirfs. Last night after the Bucs curb-stomped the Chargers, Joe spoke to work in the Bucs locker room. Joe asked Wirfs what he thinks when he sees Evans tear up excellent defenses like Evans did Sunday? Wirfs left no doubt and he was all but pointing a finger at Ira. “Oh, gold jacket!” Wirfs yelled. “Gold jacket. It’s unbelievable. “[Evans] wears a 32-long and his left arm is just a little bit longer than his right.” That left arm has made serious, stretching catches over the years. Hence, why it may be longer. Evans has stretched iit out for superior catches. There aren’t too many receivers who have better career numbers than Evans. Those that do have one of those gold jackets Wirfs talked about. For those not connecting the dots, members of the Pro Football Hall of Fame are awarded a gold jacket upon induction.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/bucs-stay-in-prime-time-sunday/|Bucs Stay In Prime Time Sunday|A lot of NFL fans thought surely the Bucs-Cowboys game in Week 16, next Sunday, Dec. 22, would be flexed out of its scheduled time slot of an 8:20 p.m. kickoff. This was simply silly non-logic. The Cowboys stink, so the thought process goes, and NBC wants a good game. Ha! That’s not how TV Networks operate. Network suits, often not even football fans or sports fans, are only worried about one thing: eyeballs. And that leads Joe to America’s Team, the Dallas Cowboys. The Cowboys pull in eyeballs, no matter their record. Throw in the reality that NBC, which is set to broadcast the game, loves NFC East teams. They literally cannot get enough of the NFC East. Why? Eyeballs. So the NFL today put the nonsense rumors to bed. The Bucs will face the Cowboys in Arlington, Tex. next Sunday at 8:20 p.m. on NBC. No, NBC and the NFL had no intention of flexing out the Bucs-Cowboys game.|2024-12-16 13:41:00|161|31|7|Bucs-Cowboys game|Bucs stay in prime time despite rumors of flexing.|5|Mixed sentiments with excitement, concerns about primetime performance, and optimism about the game.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Leopold Stotch"", ""post"": ""I\u2019ll be able to watch it without sacrificing sleep!

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/a-bunch-of-asskickers/|“A Bunch Of Asskickers”|Beastly edge rushers Joey Bosa and Khalil Mack each played more than half the Chargers’ defensive snaps yesterday. Yeah, Bosa forced a fumble from the paws of Rachaad White, but what else did those monsters collectively do? Not much. The Buccaneers’ offensive line has been mauling for weeks and it’s been hard to take them off their game with any consistency. It doesn’t matter who they’re facing. Joe is in awe of what Buccaneers Ring of Honor general manager Jason Licht has built in the offensive trenches. At 26 1/2 years old, left guard Ben Bredeson is the senior citizen of the starting O-line. The tight ends are even younger. The line is getting noticed across the NFL, as it should be. Chris Simms, the former Bucs QB turned NBC Sports Xs and Os guru took his turn this morning on PFT Live. Simms says the Bucs have enough to compete for a Super Bowl trip if they can reach the playoffs, and it starts for him in the defensive and offensive trenches. “Against those types of teams, Lions and Eagles, if [the Bucs] get in the playoffs, they’re not going to be overwhelmed by either one of those teams on the offensive or defensive line,” Simms said. “And that’s what gives them a chance in those types of matchups. They got some other issues they got to worry about; we know that. But man, when they’re playing like that on offense yesterday, they’re scary.” The trenches are a big reason the Bucs beat the Eagles and Lions earlier this season. And Joe can only imagine what the Bucs would do now to the Lions’ snuggly-soft defense. With just a little help from the Bucs defense, the Bucs offense, Joe believes, has the juice, versatility and power to will itself a win from any NFC opponent. Whether the Bucs can maximize their potential is another story.|2024-12-16 12:25:00|316|40|3|Joey Bosa and Khalil Mack|Bosa and Mack's lackluster performance in Chargers game debated.|6|Mixed sentiment with hints of optimism and concern about injuries.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Boge"", ""post"": ""A young group that should only improve.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/barkley-henry-gibbs-and-bucky-irving/|Barkley, Henry, Gibbs … And Bucky Irving|Bucs electric rookie running back Bucky Irving isn’t just having a strong rookie season.  The wild reality is that Irving is one of the best and most versatile running backs in the NFL. And he was a late fourth-round pick, No. 127 overall. Joe would love to know what’s being said in Miami, where the Dolphins drafted running back Jaylen Wright five picks before the Bucs snagged Irving. Wright has been a rather typical rookie, and now he’s Miami’s No. 3 running back spending most of his time on the bench. Irving, however, has 852 rushing yards on 152 carries. That’s 5.6 yards per carry. Only Saquon Barkley, Derrick Henry and Jahmyr Gibbs can claim to be doing better among full-time running backs. And those four are in their own stratosphere in that key stat. Irving also leads the entire NFL in catch percentage. He’s caught a ridiculous 38 of 40 balls thrown his way. The fun thing is Irving is improving as the season marches on. That’s probably equal parts him and the jelling Bucs offensive line, plus stud playcaller Liam Coen learning what works best. Enjoy it, Bucs fans. Joe sure is. As Joe documented last night, Bucs fans are watching the greatest running game in the 49-season history of the franchise.|2024-12-16 09:40:00|214|42|8|Bucky Irving|Bucs rookie RB excelling|5|Mixed sentiments, leaning towards optimism with some disagreement and praise expressed.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Itzok"", ""post"": ""Draft is more luck than skill.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/mike-evans-describes-his-35-yard-touchdown/|Mike Evans Describes His 35-Yard Touchdown|When Mike Evans caught a bullet of a pass from Baker Mayfield down the left seam for a 35-yard touchdown catch late in the third quarter yesterday, Joe could just hear it.  That would be Gene Deckerhoff’s voice hollering, “Is that a dagger?” It sure was. That gave the Bucs a 30-17 lead and the Chargers were toast. For Evans, everything was how he would order up a touchdown pass. “I knew it was coming to me,” Evans said after the game. “Baker threw a perfect ball. I had the corner on the outside which is what I want. I wanted the outside leverage.” And Mayfield may have thrown one of his best passes since signing with the Bucs in 2023. That pass was an absolute laser, hitting Evans in the hands on the fly. Bulls-eye! Evans thinks that along with everything about the play transpiring to his wants, there was also something else at play. Evans sort of thinks the Chargers had been lulled to sleep by watching too much Bucs film. “It was third-and-long,” Evans explained. “We haven’t gone long a lot on third-and-long and they were probably sitting on our routes [as a result]. “[Chargers corner] Kristian Fulton was right there, but Baker threw a great ball.” Joe hopes the success the Bucs had daring to throw a ball more than 20 yards entices Bucs offensive coordinator Liam Coen to lessen his grip on the offense. The Bucs have the weapons to score, or at least make explosive pass plays longer than 20 yards. https://twitter.com/nflonfoxpod/status/1868470406887379376|2024-12-16 09:00:00|258|29|8|Mike Evans|Evans scores 35-yard touchdown in impressive play for Buccaneers.|9|Positive reactions to great plays, players, and team performance despite some critical comments.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Ghost"", ""post"": ""Great play more things to come"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""16th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""9:08"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Hawk"", ""post"": ""With the addition of the deep throws to their running game, the Bucs put the Cowboys in a rough spot.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/bakers-crazy-enough/|“Baker’s Crazy Enough”|How about a Buccaneers-Lions NFC Championship game? One NFL analyst thinks it’s a distinct possibility, and no, it’s not Bucs homer and NFL Network personality Gerald McCoy. Joe enjoys The Richard Sherman Podcast because Sherman keeps it real, talks fast and has great knowledge and perspective of the league. It helps that he’s studying game film every week in his role for Amazon. Speaking last night, Sherman didn’t hide how impressed he was by the Bucs’ hammering of the Chargers 40-17 yesterday. A defense guy and a potential Hall of Fame cornerback, one who played for the Bucs under Todd Bowles (2021), Sherman seemed most impressed by Baker Mayfield. That surprised Joe after the Bucs defense shut out the Chargers in the second half and beat up QB Justin Herbert. “Baker was out there cheffing up and he cheffed up that Chargers defense that, like I said, has been playing some of their best football,” Sherman said. “… Very efficient, 22 of 27. What are we going to do if Baker Mayfield messes around and gets this Tampa Bay team hot and rollin’ into the playoffs and they make some noise in the playoffs and we see them in a NFC Championship matchup against the Lions? … Could that happen? I’m going to say it here. … Because the way they’re playing right now, they can get that done. “Baker’s crazy enough to go into these games, the gunslinger he is.” Sherman went on to talk about the exotic looks Todd Bowles’ defenses can use against any team and rattle any quarterback, or at least surprise them. Per Sherman, the Bucs have enough playmakers on defense to do enough to be dangerous with their high-octane offfense. Yeah, he took a shot at his former Bucs teammate Jamel Dean for finally getting an interception yesterday. Mayfield? He was Sherman’s player of the week, even against other big-time performers across the NFL.|2024-12-16 08:28:00|320|30|6|Baker Mayfield|Sherman optimistic about Bucs-Lions NFC Championship possibility.|7|Mixed sentiment with optimism and skepticism about team performance and Baker Mayfield.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""ocala"", ""post"": ""Bucs hit the jackpot when they signed Baker and did it again with Liam Coen.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/lavonte-david-explains-what-worked-for-bucs-defense/|Lavonte David Explains What Worked For Bucs Defense|Joe still believes the turning point in the game yesterday, a huge Bucs win, was the Jamel Dean interception. The Bucs followed that late-third-quarter play with a touchdown and it seemed the Chargers were shot after that. Joe knows Bucs icon Lavonte David felt that way about Dean’s pick. “It was big!” David told Joe after the game. “We have to take the ball away, that’s why we dialed up the pressure.” And therein lies what Bucs coach Todd Bowles and the defense tried to do. The Bucs smelled blood in the water. Star Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert was beat to hell last week against the Chiefs. He wasn’t 100 percent yesterday. He looked hobbled. The Bucs hit him a couple of times early and you could see Herbert looked more hurt than he was letting on. Soon, he wasn’t very mobile any longer. And that’s when the Bucs smelled blood. David told Joe the Bucs made adjustments at halftime. The biggest, he said, was that everyone had to settle down. Then attack the quarterback. With Herbert being less mobile, if he got pressure he couldn’t buy time. And that’s when the Chargers offense began to crumble. “We were able to get pressure on the quarterback,” David said. “And we received that gift [Dean’s pick].” What amazes Joe so much about how the Bucs were able to affect Herber is the Bucs were basically playing volunteers from the Salvation Army at safety. Before signing last week with the Bucs, if you told Joe that Ryan Neal was sitting outside a Publix all day ringing a bell, Joe would have believed you.|2024-12-16 08:00:00|271|26|7|Lavonte David|Bucs defense overwhelms Chargers|5|Mixed sentiments, leaning towards optimism.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""dls5492"", ""post"": ""LVD = HOF"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""16th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""8:01"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""heyjude"", ""post"": ""The Bucs came back on fire 2nd half.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/bucs-playoff-probability-jumps/|Bucs’ Playoff Probability Jumps|The Bucs hold the No. 3 NFC playoff seed if the postseason ended today. But it doesn’t. While Bucs home playoff tickets are on sale now, Tampa Bay still has hurdles to climb to get a ticket to the dance. With their clobbering of the Chargers yesterday, the Bucs’ bumped their postseason probability to 87 percent, per the New York Times/The Athletic data nerds. They’ve even got strong Wild Card chances if the unthinkable happens: Atlanta winning its final four games (including tonight) and the Bucs losing one game to either the Cowboys, Panthers or Saints. If that scenario happens, both the Bucs and Falcons would finish with a 10-7 record and Atlanta would win the NFC South by virtue of beating the Bucs twice in the regular season. However, the Washington Commanders (9-5) still must play the Eagles, Falcons and Cowboys. So if the Falcons beat the Commanders and the Bucs and Commanders each finish 10-7, then the Bucs would own a Wild Card tiebreaker on Washington after beating them on opening day. The magic formula is simple, of course. Just win.|2024-12-16 07:54:00|183|23|8|Bucs|Bucs’ playoff chances look promising with strong Wild Card possibilities.|5|Mixed feelings about the team and upcoming games, uncertainty about future outcomes.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""RVATom"", ""post"": ""I love this team and I love these guys.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/five-things-82/|Five Things|Good effing morning, Bucs fans! What an absolutely awesome Victory Monday this is. Joe hasn’t been this stoked since — well, Joe doesn’t kiss and tell. Joe hasn’t been this stoked over a Bucs win since maybe the Super Bowl win over the Chiefs. That’s how huge yesterday’s curb-stomping of the Chargers was. Make sure your coffee is hot and the mug is filled to the brim. Let’s roll! Chargers Got Knocked The Hell Out Joe can’t put into adequate words how impressive that win yesterday was. Everybody and their brother talked about how tough and mean and nasty the Chargers are. You know, a chip off Jim Harbaugh’s shoulders. And the Chargers defense, oh, the Chargers defense. The best since the 2002 Bucs. Jesse Minter is the next Bill Belichick. Please don’t get Joe wrong. Joe likes Harbaugh and likes Minter and respects the Chargers. But the way some believed the Chargers were just going to kick the snot out of the Bucs, well, the Bucs sure flipped the tables on that narrative, didn’t they? The wild thing about this is the Bucs dominated despite pulling dudes off couches to play safety. Ryan Neal was watching Bucs games a week ago like you and Joe. And the next thing you know, the guy is on the field in Los Angeles. To be fair, the Bucs struggled in the first half after scoring on their opening drive. They came alive in the second quarter. And when coaches decided that if the Chargers wanted to play smashmouth football, then give them their own medicine, that’s when the Bucs exploded. Instead, it was the Bucs pummeling the Chargers in the back alley. Maybe it is the way the Bucs won that has Joe so fired up. There was no finesse about the win. Good ol’ fashioned 1960s, slobber-knocking football. The kind that makes NFL strongman Roger Goodell break out into a cold sweat. Maybe Jamel Dean Is Better Than You Think Joe understands fans always have to have a player to hate. It seems to change each year. Bucs fans seem to have grown hoarse and bored hollering about Joe Tryon-Shoyinka and Logan Hall. In part due to how Todd Bowles lets his cornerbacks play softer-than-Charmin zone, Bucs fans earlier this season began to focus their sights on Jamel Dean. “He’s always hurt… he plays too soft… he’s not physical enough… he doesn’t get any picks…” You know the drill. Well, perhaps the happiest Bucs player in the postgame locker room yesterday was Dean. His (rare) interception helped set up a Bucs touchdown and the Bucs never had to worry about the game after that. Very interesting stats out there about the Bucs and Dean that seem to tell an important tale: Dean got hurt in New Orleans, was placed on injured reserve and missed four games in which the Bucs were 0-4. When Dean returned to start against the Giants in New Jersey, the Bucs haven’t lost since, 4-0. Just maybe, there may be a connection there. The Return Of The Big Play Joe has documented just about every week this season that the Bucs run a dink-and-dunk offense. Rarely do the Bucs throw downfield, maybe once or twice past 20 yards in a game. But Joe wasn’t complaining, only pointing this fact out. Shoot, Joe would have to be a total a-hole to whine about a lack of deep shots when the Bucs offense is one of the NFL’s best this season. Well, yesterday Liam Coen aired it out. As Tristan Wirfs told Joe, only one Bucs touchdown came in the red zone. The Chargers have one of the best red zone defenses in the league. So Coen must have thought, “Why not try to score before the ball gets into the red zone?” Next thing you know, the Bucs hung 40 on the mighty Chargers defense. With Coen loosening the collar some, this offense totally exploded. Mike Evans went bananas. And rather quietly, so too did Jalen McMillan. Maybe yesterday was a sign that Coen is about ready to release the hounds? Explosive Running Game How much has the Bucs’ running game helped Sterling Shepard, Evans, and McMillan? How much have they benefitted from the development of Bucky Irving as a top-shelf running back and Rachaad White becoming a very tough runner? Joe believes it is a factor. Irving and White are the new fire and ice for the Bucs. Irving will get you big, exciting splash plays and White has developed into a steady, reliable workmanlike running back. Tough. Yesterday was another example. White appeared to turn his ankle in the end zone early on and Joe could see with binoculars that White was in serious pain. He sucked it up and instead delivered pain to Chargers linebackers. That’s a very dangerous duo the Bucs have in the backfield. Bucs Fans Turn Out When Joe arrived in a rental car at SoFi Stadium (more on that later) and started walking through the red lot to get to the stadium (damn, what a walk), Joe couldn’t believe the amount of Bucs fans there. Just in the lot Joe parked, at least 30 percent were Bucs fans. Joe ran into a Bucs fan from Compton, Calif., by the handle of “Fonzee,” who had a sweet tailgate set up with a Bucs 2020 Super Bowl championship flag and a Mike Alstott jersey displayed. Inside the stadium, there was quite a bit of red in the end zones and all behind the Bucs’ bench — all the way to the sort of cheap seats. When Joe was in the tunnel outside the Bucs locker room in the final two minutes and heard a loud roar from the crowd, Joe thought, “Oh no, what did the Chargers do?” Instead, it was Kaevon Merriweather’s fumble recovery. Yes, there were that many Bucs fans there and they were that loud. Joe understands the Bucs fan group Buccaholics has a strong presence on the West Coast. They showed up and showed out. It sort of reminded Joe of when the Bucs last played the Chargers on the road, this time in San Diego in 2016 at Jack Murphy Stadium. Entire sections behind the Bucs’ bench were nearly solid red or orange. So nice job Bucs fans for packing SoFi Stadium and drowning out the Chargers fans. Which brings Joe to the following: Addendum When Joe left the stadium it was a full four hours after the game. Pitch black. Joe was parked in the “Red lot.” Problem was, the lot is not on the Chargers’ parking map as it is an employee lot located damn near a mile away. The parking lot(s) at SoFi goes on and on and on. One colossal parking lot. Few people there even knew where the red lot was. Anyway, imagine your car is somewhere between Tampa Bay Blvd. and Hillsborough Ave. — with Dale Mabry Highway and Himes Ave. as the borders and nothing but concrete between the four streets. So Joe was wandering around like a mental patient, dragging a laptop bag for like 45 minutes constantly hitting the car key’s unlock button praying to see headlights or hear a horn. Nothing. Joe asked one lady for directions but she couldn’t help. However, she told a friend about Joe. The friend, “Martín” (pronounced like Martín — “Mar-teen” — Gramatica) drove his white pickup to Joe, told Joe to get in and he helped find the red lot and dropped Joe off at the rental car (which finally picked up the light signals from the digital keys). Joe gave Martín $20 for his troubles. He didn’t want to take the cash, but Joe insisted he go buy himself a couple of beers. So Joe asked Martín why he helped a total stranger in a strange city in the dark of the night? He told Joe, “I don’t want people to think everyone in Los Angeles is a jerk.” So since it is the holiday season, pass along a little kindness like Martín did. Especially to a lost guy after a Bucs game dragging around a laptop bag. And no, Martín, not everyone in Los Angeles is a jerk. Far, far from it. Thanks Martín!|2024-12-16 05:00:00|1374|54|7|Five Things|Excited recap of Bucs victory over Chargers.|7|Overall positive sentiment towards team performance and camaraderie, with some nostalgia and humorous anecdotes.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Mike C"", ""post"": ""This is a young team, that is starting to believe, that is everything."", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""16th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""5:09"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""MJ"", ""post"": ""epic story about gramatica LOL for real\u2026. great guy wish he had hit that field goal in Green Bay way back in 2001"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""16th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""5:26"", ""am""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""DavidBigBucsFan99"", ""post"": ""Baker has control of the offense, he is the General.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/moving-all-in-on-liam-coen/|Moving All-In On Liam Coen|It’s time for Team Glazer to get clever and creative and open its vault like never before. No excuses. Heck, Team Glazer paid less than $200 million for the Bucs 30 years ago and now the franchise is likely worth 30 times that amount. That’s no typo. So Joe thinks it’s fair to say Team Glazer should have no issue overpaying to keep their stud offensive coordinator. It’s time to make Liam Coen an offer he can’t refuse. The superstar new playcaller in the NFL belongs to the Bucs. But that probably won’t be the case if Team Glazer doesn’t step up with a massive check soon as part of a historic and unique offer. Coen has a dynamic yet balanced offense pounding out an average of 28.8 points per game. First-year playcallers simply do not do that. He’s achieving unmatched success. Yesterday in Los Angeles represented icing on Coen’s cake. The Bucs dropped 40 on a Chargers defense that had allowed the fewest points in the 2024 season. Joe sees no reason why Coen can’t be offered head coach money to stay with the team as the playcaller. If Team Glazer has to pay Coen more than Todd Bowles so he’ll pass up head coaching interviews, then so be it. It’s a safe bet that Coen has a price. And Joe is confident it would behoove Team Glazer to meet it. If the Bucs are deadly serious about winning, then they’ll be all-in on keeping Coen. Joe doesn’t want to hear, ‘Oh, that’s not how it’s done in the NFL.’ This is the same ownership group that shocked the world and traded two first-round picks, two second-round picks and a check for $8 million to the Raiders for Jon Gruden. It was an expensive and brilliant move that got the Bucs their first ring. Team Glazer also is the same ownership group that paid tens of millions for Gruden, Lovie Smith and Greg Schiano to not coach their team. So Joe doesn’t think it’s outrageous to suggest Team Glazer should think out of the box and pay whatever it costs to keep Coen around a couple more seasons. Every time Jason Licht, talks about Team Glazer, the 11-year Buccaneers general manager mentions how “our owners” give us every possible resource to be successful. Money is never an issue, Licht says. Joe sure hopes that streak doesn’t end in February.|2024-12-16 03:45:00|400|64|9|Liam Coen|Team Glazer pushes to retain successful offensive coordinator.|2|Fans are optimistic about keeping Coen, expecting him to become head coach eventually.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""MadMax"", ""post"": ""Liam is staying\u2026.it should be obvious\u2026but i mean its up to him\u2026.lets just say we\u2019ll make it easy to stay"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""16th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""3:51"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""adam from ny"", ""post"": ""yes pay the man\u2026and let him be next man up as HC"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""16th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""3:54"", ""am""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""Leopold Stotch"", ""post"": ""Pay the man, make him assistant HC and take over when Bowles is done with his time in Tampa."", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""16th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""4:05"", ""am""]}, ""commenter3"": {""username"": ""Licht4President"", ""post"": ""Joe, I think the hard thing to match is the guaranteed money of a new HC.

At 8-6 atop the NFC South, the Bucs have the same record as the NFC West co-leaders, the Rams and Seahawks. However, the Bucs have a 6-3 record in NFC games. That’s better than the Rams’ 5-5 in-conference record and the Seahawks’ 4-5 mark, and conference record is the first tiebreaker among division leaders. So the Bucs are in fantastic position to hold the No. 3 seed, especially considering the Rams and Seahawks face each other in the regular season finale. Tampa Bay has three in-conference games remaining against the Cowboys (6-8), Panthers (3-11) and Saints (5-9).|2024-12-16 00:00:00|117|24|'10|Bucs|strong position in NFC playoff race.'|6|Mixed sentiment with some optimism and support but also some criticism and skepticism.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Jmarkbuc"", ""post"": ""Let\u2019s go Raiders."", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""16th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""1:09"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Mchammer"", ""post"": ""Raaaaaaaiiiiiddderreerrs!"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""16th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""1:20"", ""am""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""Tbbucs3"", ""post"": ""Superbowl\u2026.why not us why not now?"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""16th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""1:21"", ""am""]}, ""commenter3"": {""username"": ""BPBucsfan"", ""post"": ""Arrow \ud83c\udff9 pointing up \ud83d\udd1d Go Bucs!"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""16th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""1:22"", ""am""]}, ""commenter4"": {""username"": ""Jethro Tull"", ""post"": ""Go Raiduhs!
