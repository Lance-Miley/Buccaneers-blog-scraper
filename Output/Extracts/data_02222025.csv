That made it a little funny this week when Bussin’ With The Boys co-host Taylor Lewan asked Jameis Winston, America’s turnover machine and former Bucs franchise quarterback, if he wants to be like Mayfield, a guy who resurrected his career in Tampa after losing his starting jobs in Cleveland and Carolina. Jameis punted on talking about Mayfield or saying he’d like to be in Mayfield-style shoes. “Honestly, the quarterbacks I’ve been watching this offseason have been Aaron Rodgers and Russell Wilson — because I think they do a good job of limiting their own critical errors …” Jameis said. “Sometimes they have games where you’re just like, ‘Man, they had 18 consecutive checkdowns.’ And I think that’s the part of my game I have to really master. I know I can win a shootout. I know I can go out there and surgically dissect any defense that comes my way. But now the key to my game, to me actually elongating my career, is winning football games and protecting to the best ability I can.” Man, Joe gets great laughs from Jameis. The poor guy has been trying to cut his interceptions and play a more composed game for so many years — and he loves talking about how he’s attempting to do it. Last season, Jameis made 7 starts for the Browns and had 13 TDs and 12 interceptions. Classic. Frankly, Joe thinks Jameis should want to be more like Mayfield, who has managed to find a stellar balance between gunslinger, scrambler and poised thrower to guys out of the backfield. Mayfield completing 71.4 percent of his passes last season was a total eye-opener worthy of applause.|2025-02-22 18:16:00|295|48|5|Jameis Winston|Jameis admires Rodgers and Wilson|3|Mixed opinions on Jameis Winston, ranging from criticism to admiration towards his abilities and personality.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""JP"", ""post"": ""Oh, FFS.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/no-emotional-derangement/|“No Emotional Derangement”|Bucco Bruce Arians once jumped on the field during a Bucs playoff game and smacked one of his safeties in the head. The NFL fined Arians $50,000 and guess what the Bucs safety Andrew Adams said about it years later.  Adams told a non-NFL podcast that Arians never talked to him about what went down. Joe thought of that while listening to SiriusXM NFL Radio this week. Hosts Pat Kirwan and Jim Miller were lauding Bucs head coach Todd Bowles and how they believe he’s underappreciated. “You hope the ownership likes him as much as the players do,” said Kirwan, the former Bucs scout and Jets linebackers coach and personnel chief. Kirwan ranted about how Bowles doesn’t have to be fiery because players want to be there and they respect him. Plus, per Kirwan, Bowles is a natural that can be successful without straying off course in a variety of directions. “It’s so easy for him to know how to run a team,” Kirwan said of Bowles. “He doesn’t sit up and lose sleep at night figuring, ‘What am I going to say to them tomorrow? How am I going to treat them?’ He knows it all. He’s good with it all. He’s a communicator. “… He’s in control, like there’s no emotional derangement going on. I promise when I tell you; he goes home, puts his head on the pillow. He’s asleep til the alarm goes off, and then he just goes back to work and does what he did the day before. He gets it.” The Bowles love continued, with Kirwan saying the Bucs’ head coach gets most out of players without negative reinforcement or trying to be a player’s best friend. “You don’t really challenge him because you know he’s right. And he’s not trying to browbeat you,” Kirwan said. Joe has no problem saying Bowles has been a good head coach for the Bucs, but Joe can’t call him “great” or stand atop Bill Currie Ford on Dale Mabry Highway and scream that Bowles will lead the Bucs to the promised land. Joe and fellow fans will learn a lot about Bowles this season — with a quality roster, a franchise quarterback and playing as the national favorite in the NFC South with high expectations.|2025-02-22 16:16:00|379|33|5|Todd Bowles|Positive assessment of Buccaneers head coach Todd Bowles.|3|Mixed opinions on Coach Bowles, ranging from criticism to praise for leadership skills.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Redzone"", ""post"": ""Big fan of Kirwan but that show is as safe and kiss @ss as it gets"", ""post_time"": [""Redzone""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""OR Buc"", ""post"": ""I think Bowles has been solid.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/bucs-can-do-better-than-matthew-judon/|Bucs Can Do Better Than Matthew Judon|A stathead on Twitter compiled a research graphic on good edge rushers and how they produce year-by-year as they age. Joe can’t find it, unfortunately, but Joe remembers it well. When edge rushers hit 30 (sometimes a year or two before), their production plummets worse than Tesla stock, with rare exceptions. And Joe thinks we are seeing this with edge rusher Matthew Judon. The free agent from the Dixie Chicks will be 33 this summer. In 2021 and 2022, Judon had 12.5 and 15.5 sacks, respectively, when he was 29- and 30-years old. Why is Joe bringing this up? Because one of the PFF tribe missionaries thinks the Bucs signing Judon would be a dream scenario. Seriously. This comes from the fingers of Mason Cameron. Enter, Matthew Judon, who struggled in his time in Atlanta but still possesses the upside that warranted a third-round pick when the Falcons traded for him. Upside? Think about it: The only team that may be worse at edge rush than the Bucs is the Dixie Chicks. And they’re likely letting Judon go. So the Bucs are supposed to pick up a castoff from a lousy defense and pretend they just signed Reggie White? Hell, White’s corpse might be a better signing. What, is Randy Gregory too busy burning blunts? Of course, Cameron may be onto something. Joe has the sneaking suspicion/dread the Bucs will shop for an edge rusher at a Pinellas Park flea market and then bank on good ol’ hope rather than bring in a legitimate pass rusher.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/daniel-jeremiah-jihaad-campbell-could-be-a-10-sack-guy/|Daniel Jeremiah: Jihaad Campbell Could Be A 10-Sack Guy|Call Joe a round numbers guy. If you rack up 1,000 yards receiving, you’re a good receiver. If you throw for 300 yards, you’ve had a good day passing. Hit .300 in baseball and you’re a good hitter. Get 3,000 hits and you are a Hall of Famer. If you have 20 wins, you’re a great starter. For Joe, when it comes to pass rushers, you get 10 sacks and you’re good. Former Crows, Eagles and Browns scout Daniel Jeremiah thinks Alabama linebacker Jihaad Campbell can be that kind of a guy, despite being an off-the-ball linebacker. The Bucs have a terrible need for linebackers that will only deepen if Bucs icon Lavonte David retires. A lot of folks think, because of that, the Bucs will draft an inside linebacker at No. 19. Campbell is thought to be that kind of guy. In his pre-combine press conference, Jeremiah crowed how good of a fit Campbell would be in a Todd Bowles defense. But Jeremiah, the popular NFL Network analyst added, Campbell isn’t just an off-the-ball linebacker. Jeremiah believes on passing downs, if the team that drafts Campbell pushes him to the outside, Campbell could be a beast of a pass rusher. “When [Campbell] plays off the ball in the range and the ability to use him as a blitzer from off the ball is pretty special,” Jeremiah said. “Then I’m not so sure you can’t just get to third down and let him kick outside full-time and let him rush, and he might get you ten sacks doing that.” Joe seems to recall that was how the Bucs envisioned using former fifth-overall pick Devin White. He would be an inside linebacker and then blitz on passing downs. In 2020, the Super Bowl season for the Bucs, White chalked up nine sacks. The more Joe thinks of it, the more this Campbell has “Bucs” written all over him.  |2025-02-22 08:00:00|317|34|7|Jihaad Campbell|Potential impact pass rusher for the Buccaneers.|5|Mixed opinions on draft picks, leaning toward optimism but some concerns about player availability.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""FrontFour"", ""post"": ""Hard to assess from this film when so many of the plays he\u2019s making are when he\u2019s untouched getting to the RB or QB."", ""post_time"": [""February"", ""22nd,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""8:10"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""SB"", ""post"": ""I keep seeing Jalen McMillan\u2019s brother Tetairoa McMillan linked to us in Mocks.

Campbell is an exceptionally versatile prospect so I wouldn\u2019t be upset if the Bucs spent their second rounder to make him a Buc but this year\u2019s first can be better spent.  I can see the Bucs taking a DB with how inept the Bucs\u2019 pass D was in 2024 and Bowles\u2019s leaning on Licht as he does with the draft.  Malaki Starks is a safety who can use his 4.37 speed to play centerfield and zip into the box to make statement stops at or behind the line of scrimmage versus the run or erase underneath throws.  He stacks and sheds blocks like a veteran LB at 6\u20191\u2033/205 and explodes through ball carriers with textbook form. Nick Emmanwori is another safety who uses his 4.38 speed to play downhill with bad intentions and perfect form but he is 6\u20193\u2033/227 so I expect will be gone by the Bucs\u2019 pick.  So will CB Jahdae Barron who could step into starting and thriving for Bowles\u2019 but Azareye\u2019h Thomas could do the same and may still be on the board for the Bucs.  Those are the only two CBs in this draft with the natural talents, proclivities and skills to step nigh seamlessly into Bowles scheme and be an asset from Week 1 forward.  I would be thrilled to land any of those four DBs.  Mike Green is tempting but he has T-Rex arms and tiny hands to go with them.

He is an ankle-biter of an edge at 6\u20192\u2033 248 but has the arm length and wingspan of an early round OT combined with sophisticated pass rush plans so I see him as a both a better value and more likely to give an NFL team 10 sacks than Ward or Green as a speedy and technically refined pass rush specialist."", ""post_time"": [""February"", ""22nd,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""2:52"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter19"": {""username"": ""Ben"", ""post"": ""Unless there is a stud edge there at 19, ILb is arguably the biggest need esp if David retires.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/bucs-actually-the-nfc-powerhouse/|Bucs Actually The NFC Powerhouse|Team of the Decade? We’re halfway through the third decade of the 21st century and one could claim that the Bucs are the NFC Team of the Decade. When Bucs All-Pro left tackle Tristan Wirfs spoke with Ari Meirov of The 33rd Team in New Orleans from the Super Bowl site, Meirov was asked why the Bucs are such an afterthought in the broad scope of the NFL. Wirfs confessed he didn’t know, but he suggested Lavonte David is a victim of this oversight by those who sit in big offices in New York and Los Angeles. For example, if the 49ers or the Rams or any NFC East team or any NFC North team had the best record for five years running in the NFC, the four-letter couldn’t talk about them enough. FS1’s hollering shows would go crazy with the chatter. But, there’s the ol’ Bucs. Stuck down there on the west coast of the east coast. Florida Man’s team. Who cares? Pffttt. If you haven’t caught Joe’s drift yet, the Bucs this decade have the NFC’s most wins. And that includes a Super Bowl win, playoff appearances each season this decade and four straight division titles. Only the Chiefs and Bills have more wins than the Bucs. You’d never know it watching BSPN, FS1 or NFL Network. The national talking heads will give you plenty of talking points about the Lions and the Packers and beat you over the head with the GD Bears. The NFC East? Don’t get Joe started. Yet this decade, the Bucs are above all of them. The way national media covers the Bucs, it’s as if the franchise at times doesn’t exist. #Sad|2025-02-22 00:00:00|280|37|7|Bucs|Bucs overlooked despite being NFC powerhouse of the decade.|7|Responses vary from optimistic to critical about the team's performance and recognition in the league.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Defense Rules"", ""post"": ""Let\u2019s rebuild our defense first, then we can talk about being the NFC Powerhouse."", ""post_time"": [""February"", ""22nd,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""12:18"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Bucs4Ever"", ""post"": ""gotta be philly\u2026our SB was the last decade"", ""post_time"": [""February"", ""22nd,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""12:19"", ""am""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""garro"", ""post"": ""Powerhouse"", ""post_time"": [""February"", ""22nd,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""12:20"", ""am""]}, ""commenter3"": {""username"": ""OR Buc"", ""post"": ""Hell yea Joe!
