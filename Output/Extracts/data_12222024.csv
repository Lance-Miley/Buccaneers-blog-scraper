https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/time-management-killed-the-bucs-but-maybe-not-the-way-you-think/|Time Management Killed The Bucs — But Maybe Not The Way You Think|Joe would love to find out what analytics specialist and numbers guru Jackie Davidson (her official title is vice president of football information) and Bucs coach Todd Bowles discuss on the coach’s headsets. In theory, Davidson is offering advice on several things, including time management. The Bucs never make Davidson available to media and Bowles will never discuss what the dichotomy is between the two, if any. But with two smart people discussing in-game situations, why did one of the two decide to call a timeout late in the first half when the Bucs had the ball on the Cowboys-10 with 54 seconds left in the half? It seemed like if the Bucs scored, they would leave too much time on the clock for the Cowboys to do something. That’s exactly what happened. On the very next play, Baker Mayfield hit Jalen McMillan on an 11-yard touchdown pass. The Cowboys would take over on the Bucs-30 with 48 seconds left. The Bucs would go on to lose by two points. Whomever thought it was a slick idea to call a timeout with 54 seconds left in the half to allow the Cowboys time to score, take a bow. You may have just cost the Bucs the playoffs. Nice job.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/the-streak-continues-2/|The Streak Continues|Joe never expected to type the following: Joe hopes as long as Bucs coach Todd Bowles is the Bucs’ head coach, this team never plays another prime time game in the regular season. The loss Sunday night makes it six regular season night games in a row that the Bucs have lost. They just shat the bed when the sun wasn’t shining at kickoff. Joe doesn’t know what that is or what causes this. Joe is starting to think the Bucs are too young.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/jalen-mcmillan-still-learning-hes-no-longer-playing-cal/|Jalen McMillan Still Learning He’s No Longer Playing Cal|Joe has a saying, “Rookies play like rookies because they are rookies” because they often make (or don’t make) plays … because they are still learning they no longer have East Cornfield State on the schedule. Or in Jalen McMillan’s case, he’s no longer playing Cal. The rookie receiver had gone into the witness protection program for much of the heart of the season but of late, he’s been made an impact. Unfortunately, tonight, McMillan made impact plays for the Cowboys. Simply put, McMillan has to learn how to secure the ball. That means not dropping the ball, and that means securing the ball. He had a critical catch early in the game but as he rolled over he lost possession. Instead of an important first down, it was a drop. Then the most critical came late in the game with the Bucs down two scores frantically scrambling to score, Mayfield threw down the middle and hit McMillan on the goal line. On the replay, Joe sure thought McMillan had possession as he hit the turf. Instead of a touchdown, Cowboys cornerback Jourdan Lewis ripped the ball out of McMillan’s hands for a pick. That was lethal. After McMillan has a postseason break in January, he needs to spend time in a weight room — daily! — and build up his hands and arms and learn how to secure and protect the ball. His inability to hang onto the ball on critical plays Sunday night may have cost the Bucs the playoffs.|2024-12-22 23:40:00|252|54|3|Jalen McMillan|Rookie receiver learning to secure the ball under pressure.|4|Mixed reactions to calls, disagreements on plays and refs, concerns about defense, injury impact highlighted.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Joshua"", ""post"": ""That call is literally the death of the NFL to me it\u2019s clearly rigged that\u2019s a Touchdown\u2026"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""22nd,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""11:42"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""BucVoyager"", ""post"": ""He needs to get into the wight room"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""22nd,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""11:42"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""Bucfan1988"", ""post"": ""Dear Joe\u2019s\u2026\u2026"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""22nd,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""11:43"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter3"": {""username"": ""Jugheadfla"", ""post"": ""Com\u2019on Joe\u2026that\u2019s a low blow\u2026Mac played his tail off\u2026yea he dropped a tough one early and the Dallas defender made a good play to take it away but beyond that he played pretty damn good"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""22nd,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""11:44"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter4"": {""username"": ""Rod Munch"", ""post"": ""That was a catch, that\u2019s never not been a catch for the 40+ years I\u2019ve been watching football.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/the-bucs-are-not-a-clutch-team/|The Bucs Are Not A Clutch Team|Joe doesn’t know if the Bucs need to hire a hypnotist over this or what. When Brandon Aubrey kicked a 58-yard field goal on the opening possession of the game, it doomed the Bucs. Now Joe can just see many thousands of readers right now thinking, “What kind of nonsense is Joe typing about? It was the first drive of the game! It was just a field goal! Put the bottle down!” Well, this is why Joe typed what otherwise is a ridiculous statement. The Bucs are still looking for their first win this season when they do not score in a game first. The Bucs are now 0-6 when they do not score first. Joe has no idea what that says or why that is. Joe doesn’t know if the Bucs get in a funk that early in a game or if that changes Bucs offensive coordinator Liam Coen’s attack plan (highly unlikely) or what. Joe has to think the defense is the culprit. They can’t get enough stops to help the offense get its act together. Still, that’s a terrible harbinger for a team that expects to be in the playoffs.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/embarrassing-defense-again/|Embarrassing Defense (Again)|Joe doesn’t want to hear about injuries. All teams have injuries in December. So Joe doesn’t want to hear about how the Bucs defense didn’t play well because they had injuries. If that was the case, how the hell did the Bucs shut down Justin Herbert a week ago on the road? The Bucs defense gave Bucs fans a Christmas present Sunday night. Pull the bow off the box and rip off the wrapping and you will find a red and pewter turd inside. The Bucs are now on the outside looking in for a playoff berth because they couldn’t handle Cooper friggin’ Rush. Not Brett Favre. Not Drew Brees. Not John Elway. Cooper friggin’ Rush. He carved up the Bucs. Joe can hear Kirk Cousins laughing his arse off all the way from Atlanta. Joe really thought the Bucs got their act together in Los Angeles. Joe was really wrong, flat wrong. When Mike McCarthy — who is hanging onto his job by his fingernails — and a scrub quarterback lights up your defense, that’s on the defensive coordinator. That’s the head coach. That’s Todd Bowles. So the Bucs had poor tackling, Bowles said that at halftime? Well, why is that happening? It’s Christmastime. How can an NFL team suddenly have poor tackling in late December? Unacceptable! Anthony Nelson guarding CeeDee Lamb in the first half? Anyone at One Buc Palace care to explain themselves for that stunt? This defense or this defensive scheme is just too wildly inconsistent for Joe’s taste. Not sure how a team is supposed to succeed in the playoffs when it doesn’t know what defense will show up any given Sunday. Guess it is a good thing that in the playoffs, the chances of facing a backup quarterback are limited. That is, if the Bucs can find their way into the playoffs. Good job, Bucs! Yet another gag job on national television for America to witness.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/cowboys-26-buccaneers-24/|Cowboys 26, Buccaneers 24|So the Bucs weren’t ready for prime time and simply were not the better team tonight. Depressing! No fluke plays. Just the Bucs defense having not enough answers for almighty Cooper Rush and the Bucs offense sputtering just enough with bad snaps, bad penalties, bad drops, fumbles and some bad quarterback decisions. The Cowboys’ special teams were better than the Bucs’, too. Todd Bowles talked on the Buccaneers Radio Network before the game about how the team needed to stay hungry and not let winning get to their heads. Did the Bucs look hungry to you? Joe’s not knocking the Bucs’ effort, but they sure didn’t look mentally sharp. And they certainly didn’t look like a team with everything on the line. Dallas (7-8) did look like that team. Now the Bucs are tied with the Falcons with an 8-7 record, but the Falcons own the tiebreaker. Atlanta heads to hot Washington (10-5) next Sunday night as the Bucs host Carolina that afternoon at 1 p.m. Bowles moaned about missed tackles and drops in his halftime interview, and rightfully so. Rush completed 26-of-35 passes for 292 yards with 1 TD and the Bucs only sacked him once. That’s a 74 percent completion rate … for a guy that was completing less than 60 percent of the passes. Way too many easy looks for Rush, which was the story of the game for Joe. That was a huge factor in Dallas kicking four field goals, most of them long. After all, the Cowboys couldn’t run the ball at all. Joe’s got no positives out of this game outside of Mike Evans’ streak still being alive.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/falcons-win-up-record-to-8-7/|Falcons Win; Up Record To 8-7|Yes, Joe suffered through the Giants-Falcons game this afternoon. Thankfully, the football gods invented beer, whiskey and chocolate chip cookies. Atlanta bumped its record to 8-7 with a 34-7 thrashing of the tanking Giants. Joe hoped to get a good look at Falcons rookie QB Michael Penix in his first NFL start, but the game basically was over before Penix could land in pressure situations. Giants QB Drew Lock turned the ball over three times early in the game, including a pick-6 two plays into the third quarter that put Atlanta up 24-7. That was Lock’s second pick-6 of the day. Penix finished 18-of-27 for 202 yards with 1 interception. He certainly didn’t look special. Yeah, Joe gets that it was a debut start. Regardless, the Falcons win means the Bucs (8-6) must beat Dallas tonight to continue controlling their own destiny. Atlanta owns the head-to-head tiebreaker on the Bucs by virtue of beating the Bucs twice in October.|2024-12-22 15:55:00|159|56|6|Falcons|Falcons beat Giants in dominating fashion|2|Mixed sentiments ranging from doubt to optimism but overall leaning towards negativity.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Jw94buc"", ""post"": ""I\u2019m pretty sure the local pee wee football team could beat the Giants.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/freedom-night-for-payne-durham/|Freedom Night For Payne Durham|For more than a year, Joe has heard folks at One Buc Palace say No. 2 tight end Payne Durham is a real weapon in need of more opportunities. However, Durham has just two targets this season. What’s fun, though, is that Durham caught both balls for a total of 34 yards. He made big catches last season, too, with very few chances. Good things usually happen when the ball is throw in the direction of the giant, second-year tight end. But that’s more rare than a long Rachaad White run up the middle. Durham’s blocking is much improved and Joe only hears good things about the guy. So it will be noteworthy to watch him tonight against the Cowboys. No. 1 tight end Cade Otton is out with a bad knee and Durham likely will be asked to play at least 80 percent of the Bucs’ offensive snaps. Joe has a hunch Durham will get a couple of targets and take advantage. It might even springboard him into becoming a legitimate weapon in the offense, not just the pretend kind that he’s been before today.|2024-12-22 15:40:00|186|14|7|Payne Durham|Tight end has chance to shine in upcoming game.|4|Mixed sentiment, with some optimism but also skepticism and uncertainty.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""First Last"", ""post"": ""He needs to step up big time otherwise the Falcons are going to win the division"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""22nd,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""3:52"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""It\u2019s Exciting!!!!"", ""post"": ""You can take this to the bank.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/chucky-to-me-this-is-an-easy-pick/|Chucky: “To Me, This Is An Easy Pick”|So Chucky was back at it this weekend. Chucky has been grinding from his coach’s office in Tampa and Joe loves it. The new Barstool Sports personality dropped a 17-minute preview of the Bucs-Cowboys game for tonight. Good stuff. Basically, Chucky thinks the game will come down to Cowboys coach Mike McCarthy trying to figure out Todd Bowles’ crazy blitzes and packages with a backup quarterback. Good luck, Chucky said. “Helluva job,” Chucky said of Bowles working through so many injuries on his defense. “Todd Bowles has a little packages for everybody. So if I was Mike McCarthy, I might rev up the no-huddle offense. “Play it fast. And maybe not let Coach Bowles get to all of these crazy, creative packages that he has.” Chucky said he likes the play of the Bucs corners but he thinks perhaps the Bucs’ best corner is nickel Tykee Smith because of his versatility. “I look for this to be a great coaching matchup between Bowles and McCarthy,” Chucky said. “Two of the best at what they do.” Still, one team is playing for a division title and the other is trying to win games with a backup signal-caller. Chucky thinks this is a mismatch. “To me, this is an easy pick,” Chucky said. “I’m going with Buccaneers 31, Cowboys 20. I think Tampa is going to stay red hot and ride this wave right into the playoffs.” If the Bucs don’t win, it’s back to second place tonight. The Dixie Chicks clobbered the Giants this afternoon. We all know the Dixie Chicks, just a game back of the Bucs for the NFC South lead, own the tiebreaker over the Bucs.|2024-12-22 15:38:00|278|16|7|Chucky|Chucky predicting Buccaneers victory over Cowboys in close matchup.|4|Mixed sentiment with some negativity but also elements of hope and optimism.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""dbbuc711"", ""post"": ""Giants didn\u2019t put up any effort to win.

Before the bye week, Sage of Tampa Bay Sports Kaufman was adamant that the Bucs could win at least six of seven and make the playoffs with 10 wins.  Kaufman even picked the Bucs to beat the Chargers last Sunday. Now, Kaufman is just about all-in. He was asked if he thinks the Bucs can get into the NFC title game this season. “What seemed very highly unlikely, no longer seems highly unlikely,” Kaufman replied. “There’s a decent chance they can reach the conference title game.” Kaufman doesn’t see a conference road venue from which the Bucs cannot bring home “W.” He added that a trip to the NFC title game would earn Todd Bowles at least two more seasons on the job, 2025 and 2026.|2024-12-22 15:26:00|136|10|8|Ira Kaufman|Kaufman optimistic about Bucs reaching conference title game.|4|Mixed sentiment leaning slightly towards optimism.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Buccaneer Bonzai"", ""post"": ""We\u2019ll be conference champions"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""22nd,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""3:37"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Tye"", ""post"": ""Get past Dallas 1st and hope the Panthers don\u2019t catch the Bucs napping!"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""22nd,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""3:42"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""Vanessa Anne"", ""post"": ""One game at a time\u2026 One game at a time\u2026 One game at a time\u2026"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""22nd,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""3:48"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter3"": {""username"": ""Pewter Power"", ""post"": ""One game at a time definitely since we don\u2019t know who we\u2019d face in the playoffs and we haven\u2019t officially locked down the nfc south"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""22nd,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""5:49"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter4"": {""username"": ""MadMax"", ""post"": ""Just dont be stupid with the play calling\u2026.run it, open it for pass, get a lead\u2026.run, run, run down their throats\u2026.CLOCK MANAGEMENT MR BOWLES\u2026.just take care of your side of the ball please\u2026Liams got his"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""22nd,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""5:59"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter5"": {""username"": ""Mac"", ""post"": ""Man I am nervous about tonight.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/i-want-the-damn-record/|“I Want The Damn Record”|So Joe’s dialed in on the Bucs winning tonight in Dallas, especially if the Falcons find a way to beat the tanking Giants at 1 p.m. If the Falcons lose, well, then the Bucs can afford a loss.  But the matter of Mike Evans’ streak of 1,000-plus-yards seasons is also an underlying focus/concern. Evans, who sits 251 yards shy of 1,000 receiving yards this season, has three games remaining to up that streak to 11 years and tie Jerry Rice for the all-time mark. So Evans cannot afford a clunker tonight. Joe’s got bigger goals, however. Joe wants to see Evans nail down the record in the next two games so he can rest in Week 18 if the Bucs have the division title locked up. Evans cares deeply about the record yet doesn’t care at the same time. That was the message shared by TampaBay.com columnist John Romano after talking to Evans. “I know I can get 1,000 yards every year if I’m healthy and I’m getting the ball,” he said. “I’m not going to sit around the locker room and talk about myself, but I want the damn record. I want it. I want to tie it (this year). I want to keep it going. “I definitely want it, but that doesn’t mean it’s a burden.” Again, Joe wants Evans to nail 1,000 yards without needing a heroic Week 18. If the Bucs have the division locked up before the season finale and Evans needs, say, 143 yards to hit 1,000, then what? It would be a difficult decision for Evans and the franchise on whether to expose Evans to injury before the postseason.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/yaya-diaby-admits-outside-noise-got-to-bucs-early-in-the-season/|YaYa Diaby Admits Outside Noise Got To Bucs Early In The Season|There are very specific times when Joe and the local pen and mic club are granted access to the Bucs’ locker room on select weekdays. That time is usually around 1 p.m., give or take a few minutes for about 45 minutes to an hour. Inside the locker room, two TVs are right in the middle facing the lockers of the offensive line, the cornerbacks, the running backs and the defensive linemen. Often one TV is on NFL Network but not always (if there is a college basketball game on, that will be piped in). Sometimes the same TV will be tuned to a rebroadcast of a hollering show, “Last Take” or “Stay in Bed.” But usually, it’s NFL Network. Always, “The Pat McAfee Show” is on one of the two TVs. Sometimes, a player or two will watch but very few. If players have downtime between practice and meetings or weight room sessions or massages, they are almost universally at their lockers on their phones. But if there is a Bucs subject on a TV or a Bucs player is on the McAfee show (Joe recalls Tristan Wirfs and Baker Mayfield making live, separate appearances ), that certainly gets the locker room’s attention. So to say the Bucs don’t notice the outside noise of the sports world is, well, sort of wishful thinking. Bucs coach Todd Bowles last week flatly stated it’s all white noise. “We didn’t listen when we were losing,” Bowles said. “We’re not listening now that we’re winning, so that’s not going to be a big deal.” Well, it seems the team was listening to the outside noise, or paying closer attention to what was on the two TVs when the Bucs were winning early in the season. And all the praise heaped on the Bucs — what Nick Saban derisively refers to as “rat poison” — got in the players’ heads. That’s what Bucs outside linebacker YaYa Diaby told Joe last week. Joe asked Diaby if he’s noticed that the national hollering shows and talking heads have really jumped on the Bucs’ bandwagon in the wake of the Bucs’ curb-stomping of the Chargers. Diaby dismissed that because he didn’t want a repeat. “They did the same thing at the beginning of the season and we let that get to us,” Diaby said of all the praise the hollering shows gave the Bucs after they beat the Lions in their own Michigan den. “So this time around, we have to keep our composure. Stay on task. Keep doing what we have been doing and focus on ourselves.” After the Bucs began buying the hype, along came the arse-kicking by the Broncos to set the Bucs straight. If that result wasn’t enough to grab their attention, Lavonte David made sure the point was driven home when he ripped his teammates a new poop chute after that loss. “We started off real good,” Diaby said of buying the national hype. “Then we got to Denver and we let one get away. “So we have to focus on the main thing. Finish [the season] the way we want it to finish.” Diaby told Joe that Bucs veterans are on the young guys’ cases regularly to stay focused and ignore the white noise. “All the veteran guys,” Diaby said, are preaching focus. “Baker, Lavonte, all of the guys. They [tell] us to stay on task, focus on us.” Have Diaby and his young teammates learned? Joe asked him about the Chargers game, and Diaby only politely mentioned the win. “Great win, great win, great win,” Diaby said. And then he clammed up. “It’s behind us,” Diaby said. “Time to move on. Off to the next. “Still have three important games we have to finish and put ourselves into the best position and go to the playoffs.” So, Joe asked Diaby if he was on to Dallas. He gave Joe a simple one-word answer. “Yup.”|2024-12-22 02:00:00|654|23|5|YaYa Diaby|Bucs faced distractions but focused on winning|5|Mixed sentiments ranging from optimism to frustration and disappointment.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""EA"", ""post"": ""I think bucs players were reading joebucsfan the week that they were preparing for the Broncos,  specifically the article titled \u201cLaughing at Bo Nix\u201d, that\u2019s why they took them for granted."", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""22nd,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""3:44"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Senor Harry in Costa Rica"", ""post"": ""EA, good catch!"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""22nd,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""5:09"", ""am""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""It\u2019s Exciting!!!!"", ""post"": ""They are Cowboy READY!"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""22nd,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""6:08"", ""am""]}, ""commenter3"": {""username"": ""Lt.

Now, Joe hears the story behind it. The photo was taken an instant after Mike Evans caught a pass from scrambling Baker Mayfield, who directed traffic before he lofted the ball to Evans. As you can see in the photo, Bucs veteran Will Gholston immediately raises his hands. He told Joe he knew how the play would end. “I knew it was a touchdown,” Gholston said chuckling. “I knew it. I said, ‘Oh, it’s six!'” Former Bucs linebacker and current Bucs director of football operations Shelton Quarles told Joe this past week, “Oh, I knew Mike was gone.” So Joe asked Gholston how he knew. “I saw the breakdown of the play,” Gholston began. “I saw how the DBs were distributed. I saw where our blockers could be. And it all panned out the right way. “So, I was watching and I’m like, “‘Oh… oh… scramble… [Mayfield] threw it… there’s nobody there!’ And I know Mike is fast enough.” So when Gholston said he saw Evans turn upfield, it was over. He raised his arms to signal “Touchdown.” Then Gholston reenacted his touchdown signal for Joe, then dropped his arms to his hips which made a slapping sound and said, “That’s it!” Just like that. Evans scores and pretty much broke open the game for one of the biggest Bucs wins in memory, certainly this year.|2024-12-22 00:58:00|242|9|8|Will Gholston|Gholston celebrates Evans' game-changing touchdown play.|9|Positive and optimistic comments celebrating and supporting the Buccaneers.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""It\u2019s Exciting!!!!"", ""post"": ""On his way to 1000 yards!

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/cody-mauch-everyone-gets-credit-for-offensive-line/|Cody Mauch: Everyone Gets Credit For Offensive Line|Bucs right guard Cody Mauch seems to have less arrogance than front teeth. The farm boy from North Dakota is in his second season, a Bucs second-round pick from North Dakota State. And this year, Mauch is one of five guys who make up one of the best offensive lines in the NFL. Both don’t tell him that. Joe spoke with Mauch last week about how well the offensive line was doing. He deflected every statistic and/or compliment Joe threw at him. Pass blocking is good? Give Baker Mayfield credit. Run blocking is good? It’s the running backs. Offense is moving the ball? That’s all on offensive coordinator Liam Coen. Mauch raved about everyone on the offense except for the unit he plays on. Mauch seemed sort of embarrassed and fully uncomfortable accepting any props. “I would say [the win over Los Angeles last Sunday] was the best game we put together as an o-line,” Mauch said. “When you can keep the quarterback relatively clean and do your best with the holes in the run game. “Yeah, I’d say that was our best game we played.” The rest of Joe’s conversation with Mauch was filled with Mauch talking up his coordinator, Liam Coen; his quarterback and Bucs running backs Bucky Irving, Rachaad White and Sean Tucker. Mauch wanted no credit or compliments. “The runners make us look good by hitting those holes and making their own holes,” Mauch said. How about giving Mayfield time to throw? Mike Evans and Jalen McMillan don’t make those plays in Los Angeles unless Mauch and his offensive line brothers-in-arms give Mayfield time to throw. “It’s a great scheme Liam has,” Mauch said. “I give Liam all the credit and those guys making the plays. “Liam is putting us in such good spots with what he’s calling and when he’s calling it. What he has been calling fits our offensive line so well. He gets all the credit.” But what about keeping Mayfield’s jersey clean so he can make plays? “Baker makes us look good, too, when we get beat every once in a while,” Mauch joked. Joe pressed Mauch further about how he and the offensive line are allowing the Bucs offense to hum. Even then, Mauch only accepted a tiny bit of credit. “It’s give and take,” Mauch said. Joe’s sure glad Mauch isn’t this bashful when he tosses defensive backs to the ground 20-30 yards downfield like he did against the Raiders.|2024-12-22 00:25:00|410|15|5|Cody Mauch|Modest and selfless attitude despite offensive line's success.|5|Mixed sentiments ranging from optimism about Liam to frustrations with pop-up ads and teeth.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Timbucs2"", ""post"": ""Typical Midwesterner.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/gameday-tampa-bay-316/|GameDay Tampa Bay|Game 15 Bucs (8-6) at Cowboys (6-8) Kickoff: 8:20 p.m. TV: NBC (WFLA-TV Channel 8, locally) with Mike Tirico, Cris Collinsworth, Melissa Stark and Carrie Underwood.  Streaming: NFL+, Peacock (Geographic restrictions apply; subscription may be required). Radio: Buccaneers Radio Network WXTB-FM 97.9 in the Tampa-St. Petersburg region (Transmisiones de radio en español en WTMP-FM 96.1 y WMGG-AM 1470 en Tampa). Additional stations throughout Florida on the Buccaneers Radio Network can be found here. The game also will be broadcast on SiriusXM Channel 226 (Buccaneers Radio Network feed). Westwood One national feed can be heard on SiriusXM Channel 88. Weather: For those tailgating, the weather will be rather nice for north Texas considering it is Christmas Week, per AccuWeather.com. Sunny skies with temperatures in the low-60s. Temperatures will begin to drop into the high-50s from late afternoon until kickoff as the sun sets. AT&T Stadium is an enclosed dome (unlike the canopy/pavilion-like fixed roof that covers SoFi Stadium) and the roof is expected to be closed tonight. Temperatures after the game should be in the mid-50s. Odds: Per Hard Rock Bet, as of midnight, Bucs -3.5 (-200); over/under 48.5. Referees: Land Clark and his gang are pretty straight down the middle. Road teams are 7-6 in games in which his posse has worked. Clark and his outfit seem to swallow the whistle. This crew averages 11 flags a game, or just over two penalties a quarter. That’s not awful. Injuries: Bucs — Out: WR Kameron Johnson (ankle), S TE Cade Otton (knee), Antoine Winfield (knee). Doubtful: K.J. Britt (ankle). Questionable: S Mike Edwards (hamstring). Cowboys — Out: WR Jalen Brooks (knee), CB Trevon Diggs (knee). Questionable:  G T.J. Bass (thigh), LB Eric Kendricks (personal/calf), CB Jourdan Lewis (elbow), DE Micah Parsons (illness),  S Juanyeah Thomas (knee), LB Nick Vigit (foot). onkey (knee/shoulder), LB Denzel Perryman (groin). Outlook: So, are the Bucs who curb-stomped the Chargers going to show up tonight at Jerry’s World? Or will the Bucs go full Cybil, doing a 180 and stink out loud like they did against the Broncos or Stinking Panthers? The Bucs offense is red hot but how much will the loss of tight end Cade Otton hurt? He’s having a career year and seemed to be Baker Mayfield’s security blanket, especially when Mike Evans was hurt? This may be a game for the Bucs to lead on their strong run game. Partly because the Bucs are running so well but also the Cowboys are terrible defending the run. That is sort of what Joe expects, which some timely throws to Evans. However, with Otton out, Joe fully expects Evans to get hounded all night. Simply put, the Bucs must win this game, that’s all there is too it. The Bucs don’t have the luxury of any more slip-ups! Fun facts: Last week Bucs QB Baker Mayfield had four touchdown passes against Los Angeles. He now has three four-touchdown games this season. Only Joe Burrow and Lamar Jackson have as many. … RB Bucky Irving has 100+ scrimmage yards in three of his last four games. He leads all rookies in scrimmage yards (1,148) and rushing yards (852). … Last Sunday WR Mike Evans caught nine passes. That gave him 52 catches this year. As a result, Evans became just the fifth player in NFL history to have at least 50 catches in his first 11 seasons. … WR Jalen McMillan is looking for his third straight game with a touchdown. … ILB Lavonte David had 12 tackles last week giving him 104 this season. It’s his 11th season with at least 100 tackles. … DT Vita Vea has two sacks in his three games facing Dallas. … DT Calijah Kancey has a sack in four of his five road games this season. … Cowboys QB Cooper Rush looks for his third straight game with at least two touchdown passes. … RB Rico Cowdle has at least 110 rushing yards in his last three games. … WR CeeDee Lamb has 489 career receptions. That’s the second-most catches in the first five seasons of a career for any player in NFL history. … LB Micah Parsons had two sacks last week giving him 14 games with multiple sacks. … CB Daron Bland has eight passes defensed in his past five games. He is looking for his sixth-straight prime time game with a pass defensed.|2024-12-22 00:00:00|728|9|7|GameDay Tampa Bay|Bucs and Cowboys game preview|5|Mixed sentiments with hope for Bucs' success but also concerns and cautious optimism.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Dlavid"", ""post"": ""The Bucs will prove to us today if they have been drinking the media kool aid !!
