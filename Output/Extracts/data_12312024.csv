https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/bucky-irving-talks-about-getting-toughened-up-at-4-years-old/|Bucky Irving Talks About Getting Toughened Up At 4 Years Old|One of the most fun personal stories told by a Buccaneer came 13 years ago when then-head coach Raheem Morris formally thanked his three uncles for beating the crap out of him daily as a child because it led to his success. Bucky Irving may have topped that today. Irving joined The Rich Eisen Show and explained that he was introduced to football at 4 years old. His uncle, per Irving, brought him onto a big field in front his home and lined him up in Oklahoma drills against a 14-year-old cousin. Those aren’t typos. Irving was 4 and the other kid was 14. Irving said his uncle wanted young Bucky to understand football is a tough game that requires painful commitment to be successful. So he had the cousin bury Irving. “He made him like hit me hard to realize, like, you sure this is what you want to do?” Irving said. “It was fun but it kind of hurt … After that, I wasn’t scared to go against nobody else.” Irving was smiling telling the story; he didn’t look like a guy re-living a childhood trauma. Joe loved it, Frankly it jogged a memory of Joe’s youth. Joe had developed a bad baseball habit of bailing out of the batter’s box slightly on inside fastballs. Joe’s manager freaked out and the next day brought his son, a top high school pitcher, to throw batting practice. The kid was given one order when it was Joe’s turn: fire fastballs inside. Joe was told the fastballs would keep coming until the bailing out stopped. Joe was cured rather quickly, but then the manager kicked it up a notch. “Now lean in and take one on the shoulder so you know it’s not so bad.” The rest is history. Joe went home with a nasty bruise and never came close to achieving what Bucky Irving or Raheem Morris have.|2024-12-31 17:45:00|318|19|7|Bucky Irving|Tough football upbringing leads to fearless success.|3|Mixed reactions to baseball anecdotes with some positivity, skepticism, and critique.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Sheen"", ""post"": ""Kid is so dam impressive"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""31st,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""5:53"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Chris K"", ""post"": ""That\u2019s a cool baseball story, Joe.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/sleepy-rusty-jordan-whitehead/|Sleepy, Rusty Jordan Whitehead|Not every big Bucs fan stayed awake Sunday night to enjoy the greatest gift Raheem Morris ever gave the franchise. Head coach Todd Bowles was snoozing as the Commanders beat the Falcons in overtime. (That seemed to ignite the legion of Bowles haters into a rage. They don’t need much.) Also, Jordan Whitehead confessed to sleeping through the game that was so critical to the Bucs’ playoff hopes. Whitehead told the Buccaneers Radio Network that he watched some but couldn’t stay awake. Apparently, Whitehead was not at the local-bar gathering where Baker Mayfield and other players were gathered to find good mojo. Whitehead also said that he was rusty in Sunday’s game against the Panthers, feeling his four weeks on injured reserve (pectoral muscle) even after training hard to be ready. “Definitely felt a little slow in the beginning [of the game], legs felt like I was running in mud a little bit,” Whitehead said. “And, you know, first time really using my left side, trying to get off blocks and things like that. It’s hard to simulate that in practice.” The great news was Whitehead said he felt good Monday morning, so he’s very encouraged about stepping up his game “week after week.”|2024-12-31 14:31:00|204|35|4|Jordan Whitehead|Whitehead admits sleepiness and rustiness affecting performance in football game.|2|Mixed sentiments ranging from disappointment and concern to optimism and humor.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Gbobucsfan"", ""post"": ""What bar does Baker frequent ???

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/no-ceiling-mike-evans/|No “Ceiling” Mike Evans|It’s possible that Mike Evans’ game is on the rise, something atypical for a 31-year-old receiver with 176 NFL games on his résumé. Listening to Todd Bowles with WFLA-TV sports chief Dan Lucas yesterday, Joe heard the head coach say Evans is taking his game to another level. “He goes up all the time. Nothing he does surprises you. He doesn’t have a ceiling,” Bowles said of Evans. “He executes. He can play big-boy ball. He can play small ball. He can run after the catch. He can do everything you want. He can block. He can do all the above for us and we need every part of it.” Joe sees a do-it-all Evans, as well. Even if the Bucs won’t throw him one or more go-balls in a game, Joe thinks Evans remains capable of executing the deep shot. Sunday’s CBS game announcers noted Evans emphasized to them that he’s fully healthy to go deep. In the four games this season in which Evans got nine or more targets, he’s had a big game and the Bucs are 4-0, including wins against the Eagles and Chargers. Perhaps more important is that in each of those four games, Evans had 94 or more yards. He needs only 85 yards on Sunday to reach 1,000 yards for the 11th consecutive season. So it seems the Bucs’ formula Sunday best include at least 10 targets for Mr. Evans.|2024-12-31 11:56:00|237|26|8|Mike Evans|Evans is exceeding expectations and poised for success.|6|Mixed sentiment with optimism about Mike Evans' performance but some concern over game outcomes.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""TheBucsAnthem"", ""post"": ""IMOH \u2026..

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/the-power-of-the-oregon-duck-bucky-irving-talks-bucs-ball/|The Power Of The (Oregon) Duck: Bucky Irving Talks Bucs Ball|So Bucky Irving made an appearance today on “Good Morning Football,” and the NFL Network cast raved about his professionalism on and off the field. What won the co-hosts over was the final question when Bucky was asked if the Bucs are playoff bound. He had a stern look and talked about what the Bucs had to accomplish in order to win Sunday. Bucky didn’t mention playoffs, only winning a game. “That’s a pro,” co-host Kyle Brandt said. Some other highlights of the sitdown: Bucky’s face lit up when he was asked about Baker Mayfield. “That’s a guy we’ve built a relationship [with] over time,” Bucky said. “That’s a guy that I love. … That’s a guy that you want around. A guy who truly loves the game.” When asked earlier if the Bucs could do damage in the playoffs, Bucky said they could if the team does things the right way. “We just have to play our brand of football,” Bucky said. “When we play our brand of football we are a very good football team.” Joe interpreted that as if the Bucs come prepared and play sound fundamentally, unlike the solid waste they served up in Dallas, they should win. Of course, being a national show, Bucky couldn’t escape without being asked about the duck. Bucky liked the duck but since he’s the only guy on the roster from Oregon (you know, the Ducks?) he took heat about it from his teammates who went to school at Washington, Oregon’s long-time bitter Big Ten rival. “We have a lot of Washington guys on our team,” Bucky said. “They are always giving me crap. A rookie, I can’t say [anything] to them as I lost to them twice [his last year at Oregon]. So I just have to hear it.” Bucky added that the duck on the field, “is the wildest thing I’ve ever seen.” Bucky took the duck’s appearance Sunday as a sign of good luck and an omen that Oregon will win the national championship. Joe’s down with that but Joe’s more intrigued about a Bucs win at home Sunday against the slimy Saints and a home playoff game the following week.|2024-12-31 10:46:00|364|21|8|Bucky Irving|NFL player talks Bucs football and positivity.|8|Positive comments about Bucs, Duck, and players, with some humor and excitement expressed.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""orlbucfan"", ""post"": ""All I can say is GO BUCS!! with or without the duck. 10-7 Sunday!!!!!"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""31st,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""10:56"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""PSL Bob"", ""post"": ""Great interview!

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/bucs-get-an-a-3/|Bucs Get An A+|Boy, you don’t see this often. Maybe when Tom Brady was slinging the rock in these parts is the last time Joe saw this. Over at CBS, John Breech does a weekly report card on each team. And Breech really, really was impressed by how the Bucs seal-clubbed the Stinking Panthers when Tampa Bay absolutely had to have a win. Buccaneers A+ … Baker Mayfield made sure they got it. The Bucs QB went off against the Panthers, throwing for 359 yards and five touchdowns. The Bucs have a well-rounded receiving attack and they showed off against Carolina: They had four receivers who finished with at least 50 receiving yards. One of those pass-catchers was Bucky Irving, who finished with 190 total yards on just 24 touches (113 rushing yards and 77 receiving yards). The Buccaneers are a dangerous team and they now just took one small step closer to making the postseason. And the large step comes Sunday at The Licht House. Hopefully. Joe really doesn’t know what to make of the Bucs. Every time they have a big win, they fall flat on their face the next week. Beat Detroit on the road and then get spanked by Denver at home by a rookie quarterback starting his third game. Slam the Eagles and then choke away a win against the Dixie Chicks. Curb stomp the slimy Saints and then get alley beaten by the Crows. Bodyslam the Chargers on the road and then get MMA’ed by the Cowboys. Since burying the Commanders and Lions in Weeks 1 and 2, each time the Bucs had a big win (yes, beating the slimy Saints is always a big win) the team cannot carry over the momentum into the next week.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/bucs-tied-for-7th-in-total-sacks/|Bucs Tied For 7th In Total Sacks|One of the safest bets in football is that a Todd Bowles defense, no matter who is and isn’t rushing off the edge, will rack up a big season sack total.  The 2024 Bucs have a weak edge rush/four-man pass rush, but through 16 games they’ve found their way to 44 sacks, aka drive-killers. That ranks tied for the 7th-most sacks in the NFL. That’s more sacks than the Eagles, Commanders, Steelers, 49ers, Rams … and the list goes on. No surprise, last year the Bucs finished the season ranked tied for seventh in total sacks. And in 2022, where did the Bucs rank in total sacks? Tied for seventh! Todd Bowles told the Ira Kaufman Podcast last winter that adding a beastly edge rusher is not a high priority unless he’s sure the player will add to the team’s total sacks number. Bowles’ core point was that adding a 15-sack guy is nice but not if the net result is fewer sacks. Regardless, sacks matter, as does edge pressure. And hopefully the Bucs can find a few games of magic left in the body of Bucs sacks king Shaq Barrett. That could make a massive difference in the playoffs.|2024-12-31 08:31:00|200|42|'8|Bucs|Consistent success in sack totals|1|Mixed opinions on pass rush and defense, with some optimism for potential improvements.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""PSL Bob"", ""post"": ""Who will be the most rested edge rusher in the league?

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/we-got-to-stick-to-our-script/|“We Got To Stick To Our Script”|Revealing comments emerged yesterday. Bucs head coach Todd Bowles said on SiriusXM NFL Radio that he believes the Bucs “have gotten a lot better” overall since their 4-6 start. He included his defense. Bowles said that while he was upset by the way Carolina scored its 14 points on Sunday, 14 was still a good defensive showing. Then Bowles signaled to fans to not expect any adjustments to how the Bucs play. They’re going all-in on their style. “We got to stick to our script and keep doing what we’re doing,” Bowles said. Asked what he’s stressing to coaches, not players, Bowles said it’s about simplicity. “Keep teaching [players] and try not to make them do nothing that they haven’t been doing,” Bowles said. “Don’t try to put more on the plate; keep it on their plate and make it as simple as possible so they can go out and play fast.” Joe heard that and thought about what appeared on the pay-per-view site TheAthletic.com yesterday. Longtime NFL writer Mike Sando caught up with three team executives and asked the unnamed trio to weigh in on the state of the NFC playoffs. Interesingly, one exec said if the Lions play defense like the Bucs do, they’ll lose to Minnesota. The feeling is that Detroit now lacks the personnel to defend Minnesota’s top wideouts with man coverage. “That becomes tricky,” the exec said. “If Detroit is going to live in the Tampa world (of split-safety zone coverage), which they do a good job with, the Minnesota skill, with Aaron Jones and those guys, will be enough, especially with Kevin (O’Connell) doing a good job keeping the game safe for Sam (Darnold). Because on the other side, I think Minnesota can create a turnover or two with Jared (Goff) and those guys (on the Lions’ offense).” Can Tampa Bay’s defense hang with the Vikings or Lions in the playoffs? Well, it’s unlikely if Bowles “sticks to our script” with the Bucs’ current personnel. Perhaps he’ll make changes when the time comes. Joe doesn’t recall ever seeing receivers consistently wide open like the Vikings have had this season. Their separation seems incredible, and Joe highly doubts the Bucs have the defensive firepower to keep 30 points off the board.|2024-12-31 08:07:00|376|25|4|Todd Bowles|Bucs sticking to current defensive strategy despite doubts.|4|Mixed feelings about defense and playoffs, concerns about coaching decisions, health, and opponents.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Tampabaybucfan"", ""post"": ""TBBF asks again\u2026.When is the last time we tipped or batted a ball down \u201c?"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""31st,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""8:15"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""BillyBucco"", ""post"": ""Maybe, but Detroit only scored 17 earlier this year.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/the-balanced-bucs-offense/|The Balanced Bucs Offense|On Sunday, the Bucs had as close to a Mike Leach game as maybe Joe has seen. Joe and the Sage of Tampa Bay sports Ira Kaufman go round and round about the following. Ira believes in a balanced offense: half run, half pass. Joe thinks that’s crazy talk. Running for the sake of running if it’s not working is a colossal waste of time, effort and manpower. Go heavy with what works. Joe takes the side of the late Mike Leach. Once when coaching Washington State, Leach was asked about a balanced offense and he scoffed out loud, replying, “A balanced offense is not 50 percent run, 50 percent pass because that’s 50 percent stupid.” Instead, Leach said, what a balanced offense looks like is when a quarterback can distribute the ball evenly to all his weapons. Boy, did Baker Mayfield do that for the Bucs on Sunday. Nine different players caught passes and five different players ran the ball (not counting Kyle Trask and Mayfield himself). Now that’s a balanced offense. The Bucs have a rare offense this year: They are explosive on the ground and lethal in the pass. Bucs coach Todd Bowles said yesterday that is hard to accomplish. “If you do something well, the other team is going to take it away,” Bowles said. “You know, they’re going to study you so they can take something away. “You’re never going to be completely balanced. They’re going to take away what you do best or they’re going to at least slow it down or try to slow it down so you have to constantly be creative and do other things and that’s working out for us this year.” If you are so good offensively, a defense becomes handcuffed if they try to allocate resources to take something away. That defense will get roasted by something else. That’s where the Bucs offense is now. On Ira’s podcast, which was recorded from the Bucs’ coaches booth well after Sunday’s game, Ira said this year’s Bucs offense is the best he’s seen. Better even than with Tom Brady. That’s saying a lot. Joe couldn’t go that far but understands Ira’s point. Both offenses were exceptional but different. Bucco Bruce Arians and Tom Brady took plenty of shots down the field. Current Bucs offensive coordinator Liam Coen is very hesitant to do that. The Bucs’ offense in 2020 and 2021 was a superior passing offense. The run game with Ronald Jones and Playoff Lenny was OK if not good. This year? It’s the Bucs’ run game that is dynamite. The passing game is good, not great. Man, it makes Joe ill thinking how good this offense could be with Chris Godwin.|2024-12-31 07:00:00|451|21|5|The Balanced Bucs Offense|Bucs offense debate on balance vs. effectiveness.|8|Mixed reactions with high praise for the offense but some concerns about specific players/coaches.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Mike C"", ""post"": ""Probably 2 to 3 games better with Godwin Joe."", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""31st,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""7:17"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""RVATom"", ""post"": ""From a \u201cwatching perspective\u201d I\u2019d agree this is the best Buc\u2019s offense I\u2019ve ever watched.

As one can imagine after 16 games the Bucs have some guys beat up. What team doesn’t? So yesterday, Bucs coach Todd Bowles remarked about three hurt starters and a healthy former starter and his status. Jamel Dean on Sunday suffered what the Bucs’ media relations department classified as a “bilateral knee injury,” which is an injury to both knees. Bowles had no update. Bucs tight end Cade Otton has missed the last two games with a knee injury. Of Otton’s status, Bowles said the team likely won’t know until the end of the week how Otton is responding to treatment. “He’ll work through the week and once we see progress, we’ll make that determination probably Friday or Saturday,” Bowles said. Also, Bowles hasn’t yet written off safety Antoine Winfield for the win-and-in finale against the slimy Saints. “He’s getting better,” Bowles said. “Again, I have to see him run a little bit more before I make that decision.” And lastly, since the Bucs re-signed sacks king Shaq Barrett, Bowles didn’t rule him out from suiting up and hitting the field to get his sea legs back. “Yeah, we’ll consider it,” Bowles said. “We have to see how his practice week goes as well.” How awesome would it be if all four could return for Sunday?|2024-12-31 03:45:00|226|19|5|Todd Bowles|Injuries impact Bucs starters' availability for Week 18 finale.|5|Mixed sentiments about Shaq's return, team performance, injuries, and upcoming games.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""MadMax"", ""post"": ""We\u2019ll get through this unless Todd fs it up\u2026but so far against teams we\u2019re supposed to beat, we\u2019re hanging in there i guess"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""31st,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""4:02"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Zwak"", ""post"": ""So everyone is good to go we just don\u2019t want to share this with our opponents!"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""31st,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""4:09"", ""am""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""adam from ny"", ""post"": ""if we\u2019ve gotta deal with detroit or minnesota\u2026"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""31st,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""5:23"", ""am""]}, ""commenter3"": {""username"": ""heyjude"", ""post"": ""Wishing the best for Otten, Winfield, and Dean.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/so-what-happened-to-the-duck/|So What Happened To The Duck?|It appears the duck may have flown the coop and found a new flock. Yeah, the Bucs duck, that’s the duck that tormented Trey Palmer on a punt return in Sunday’s beat down of the Stinking Panthers. Joe suggests the duck brought some sort of divine intervention from the football gods not wanting the poor thing to get hurt. As a result, Joe Tryon-Shoyinka blocked the Johnny Hekker punt that J.J. Russell scooped-and-scored on a 23-yard return to put the game on ice. The duck flew onto the field as Palmer was setting up readying for a punt return. Buccaneers Radio Network sideline reporter T.J. Rives told Joe after the game that Palmer was clearly startled by the duck and seemed to act like, with glances to the sideline, he was expecting officials to call a timeout. Or perhaps Palmer thought he should call a timeout to save the duck from being trampled. After the score, a Bucs ball crew member was seen shooing the duck off the field. The duck danced with him, not wanting to leave as the creature seemed to enjoy the attention. CBS TV cameras caught another Bucs employee scooping the duck up, cradling him and petting him to calm it down. Turns out that staffer, a guy by the name of Anchor Brant, uploaded a TikTok video walking out of the stadium after the game with the duck. A member of the Bucs flagbearers, Brant said in the video he was going to release the duck where it would be safe, but offered no specifics. Joe hopes that didn’t happen. The duck is already a celebrity and the Bucs could have given the duck the best of nests and trotted the duck out for games (not unlike the Auburn eagle) hoping the duck would spread its wings luck to the Bucs in future games. Releasing the duck would be a massive (marketing) opportunity lost! Brant is a bit of a cottage local celebrity. Two years ago as a senior studying communications at South Florida, Brant was involved in a national contest to capture the title of “USA Mullet Championship.” As far as Bucs coach Todd Bowles’ reaction to the duck, he said after the game it cost the Bucs 10 minutes because the game was delayed trying to coax the bird off the field. Yesterday, Bowles explained what the duck means to him (not a whole lot). “It’s like watching ‘The Flintstones’ and ‘The Jetsons,'” Bowles laughed as he raised his arms wide, shrugging his shoulders. “It’s a cartoon to me.”  |2024-12-31 00:00:00|426|44|5|The Duck|Duck causes chaos but could have brought luck to Bucs.|4|Mixed sentiment on duck incident, potential for marketing opportunity.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Buccaneer Bonzai"", ""post"": ""Game Ball."", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""31st,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""12:19"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Jethro Tull"", ""post"": ""Ring of Honor."", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""31st,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""12:22"", ""am""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""GoneGator"", ""post"": ""Free Bird!"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""31st,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""12:23"", ""am""]}, ""commenter3"": {""username"": ""Rod Munch"", ""post"": ""You ever heard of Peking duck?
