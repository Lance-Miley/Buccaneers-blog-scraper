https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/what-a-day-for-the-bucs/|What A Day For The Bucs!|It’s not quite 12 hours ago that the free agency siren sounded. Joe never dreamed a great Bucs day would be over in around 30 minutes. The day began when it was learned left guard Ben Bredeson would stick around. Great. Then we learned the second-best receiver in Bucs history, Chris Godwin, would stick around. Awesome! Then, the move that rocked the NFL: Bucs AC/DC-loving general manager Jason Licht, who has long been reluctant to bring in a proven veteran edge rusher in free agency, broke down and grabbed Hasson Reddick for $14 million in 2025. Joe couldn’t believe it. Still hard to believe. Are we living in some twisted “Twilight Zone” episode? You know, like flying over Manhattan only to see dinosaurs or Civil War veterans still alive and kicking in their 40s? When Joe saw the nation alerted to the Reddick signing, Joe thought for sure it was a fake Adam Schefter account and that Joe was being punked. You know, the fake handles that always pop up at the start of free agency. Joe did a double take and just stared at the Twitter. This can’t be? But yes, the blue checkmark was there. It was Schefter’s real account. The Bucs signed an edge rusher. An honest-to-goodness real edge rusher. Dogs and cats live together! Pigs fly. Joe tried to sleep but can’t. Even tried to count Hasson Reddick sacks. No dice, can’t sleep. Joe almost wishes training camp started this morning. Absolutely fired up for the season and the league year hasn’t officially begun. And the draft is still weeks away. Just an awesome day for the Bucs. Licht wasted zero time in getting his four biggest wishes fulfilled: * Bring back Lavonte David. * Re-sign Bredeson. * Re-sign Godwin. * Find an edge rusher. What a day — and night!

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/robert-hainsey-gets-paid-in-jacksonville/|Robert Hainsey Gets Paid In Jacksonville|Tristan Wirfs called this four weeks ago. Bucs center Robert Hainsey is outta here.  Today, per NFL Network, Hainsey signed a three-year deal for $21 million to play center for Jacksonville. What a whopper of a contract for a guy who made one start last season — one in which he kicked ass for the Bucs in a blowout of the slimy Saints. Hainsey was the Bucs late-third-round pick in 2021. He rode the bench and then was pressed into action in the summer of 2022 after Ryan Jensen’s gruesome knee injury in training camp. Hainsey started for two seasons (never missed a game) and then was back on the bench after the Bucs drafted Graham Barton last season. A team-first Buccaneer, Hainsey, 26, now gets a chance to show what he can do for new Jags head coach Liam “El Serpiente” Coen, the 2024 Bucs playcaller.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/haason-reddick-signings-evokes-a-big-what-if/|Haason Reddick Signing Evokes A Big “What If?”|Over and over and over and over and over again last year, like a Corgi yapping for an long overdue dinner, Joe hammered away here begging Buccaneers Ring of Honor general manager Jason Licht to trade with Philadelphia for Haason Reddick. Reddick, the beastly edge rusher, eventually went to the Jets in April in exchange for a 2026 third-round pick — yes, 2026 — that could have become a second-rounder if specific production was reached. Now he’s a Buccaneer on a one-year, free-agent contract for $14 million. Joe can’t help but wonder what might have been if Reddick landed on the shores of Bradenton Beach a year ago. Would the Bucs have been beaten Washington in the playoffs? Would the Bucs have won 12 games instead of 10? Joe could go on. Joe realizes the Eagles, a very smart organization, may have had zero interest in trading Reddick to their conference rivals in Tampa. Also, Reddick wanted a fat new contract before suiting up last season and, perhaps, the Bucs weren’t prepared for whatever that reality was. Or maybe the Bucs simply believed YaYa Diaby would ascend last season while Joe Tryon-Shoyinka balled out in a contract year. It’s unclear and Joe doesn’t suspect the truth to come out. Still, it’s hard not to see how the Bucs are now hot in the pants for Reddick — to fill a weakness seen in last year’s team. “What ifs” are always part of NFL fandom, and this sure is a good one. Yeah, Joe realizes Reddick hasn’t played a snap in pewter and red and has a lot to prove after a miserable 2024 on and off the field.|2025-03-10 15:02:00|278|64|3|Haason Reddick|A missed opportunity leads to speculation and regret for fans.|4|Mixed reactions, cautious optimism, concerns about player performance, calls for additional improvements.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""miken"", ""post"": ""I thought the same thing.

Fast enough that it roused the shot-caller of the Bucs, that’s Mr. AC/DC-lover himself, Jason Licht. Per the creator, curator and overall guru of Pro Football Talk, the great Mike Florio, some inaccurate transaction news was twittered out. Twitter being Twitter, the incorrect transaction claiming Licht signed running back Samaje Perine quickly caught fire and began to spread quicker than a Malibu wildfire. Licht doused the flames in a hurry, retweeting the bad tweet with the words, “No we did not.” End of (bad) story. Cursory knowledge of the Bucs’ depth chart at running back should have been a pretty glaring tip that Licht likely had no interest in signing a backup running back. Still, that shows the power of Twitter, even when it’s badly malfunctioning. Hey, Elon Musk, it’s free agent week. We need your site up and running. Maybe it’s time for you to go back to work? Your spaceships are blowing up, Tesla stock is tanking worse than a lousy Lovie Smith-coached squad and #NFLTwitter damn near killed X.|2025-03-10 14:29:00|190|0|3|Jason Licht|Twitter misinformation about Samaje Perine signing quickly clarified.||No comments available.|{}
https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/specialist-role-for-haason-reddick/|Specialist Role For Haason Reddick?|Will the Buccaneers’ new edge rusher be a full-time player? One astute analyst, a guy who spent a lot of time with Joe during the NFL Scouting Combine, thinks Haason Reddick could be more of a pass rush specialist than a three-down player. Chris Simms, the NBC Sports film guru and former Bucs quarterback, co-hosted a live free agency show on NBC’s YouTube page today and expressed his love for the Bucs signing Reddick, who was a disgruntled member of the Jets last year. Simms noted how it seems Reddick got terrible advice and should have just shut up and played after he got traded to New York from Philadelphia last year. But Reddick held out, returned in October and had a bad season. Per Simms, if Reddick had a full, normal year, he would have been at least a nine-sack guy with the Jets and commanded a lot more than the $14 million the Bucs will pay him for 2025 on a one-year deal. In short, Simms thinks Buccaneers Ring of Honor general manager Jason Licht nailed the Reddick signing. He also thinks Reddick likely will be more of a pass rush specialist with Logan Hall handling more first- and second-down duties on the edge. Joe isn’t sure. Reddick used to be an inside linebacker (2017-2019) and is very versatile. Also, he is used to a full-time work load. But Simms may be right. Perhaps a lighter load in the run game alongside elite defensive tackles enticed Reddick to come to Tampa? Simms was adamant that Reddick is a great fit in with the Bucs because his double teams will be limited with Vita Vea, Calijah Kancey and YaYa Diaby in the mix on passing downs. Simms was a special guest on the recent Ira Kaufman Podcast. |2025-03-10 13:48:00|298|40|7|Haason Reddick|Bucs edge rusher role speculation.|5|Mixed reactions from fans about recent defensive acquisitions and player roles.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/pressure-mounts-on-josh-grizzard/|Pressure Mounts On Josh Grizzard|What a Monday it’s been for rookie Bucs playcaller Josh Grizzard, the 34-year-old that Tampa Bay hopes will be an absolute wizard with its high-powered, highly-paid offense. Look at all the cash the Bucs are dropping on their offense, which will not have one rookie starter next season barring unforeseen events. Today the Bucs put $20+ million in iconic receiver’s Chris Godwin’s pocket over the next three seasons, and left guard Ben Bredeson more than doubled his salary. Mike Evans will earn $21 million plus incentives in 2025, and Baker Mayfield and Tristan Wirfs each earn more than all those guys — for an offense that averaged 29.5 points per game last season. Grizzard has no time for a learning curve unless the Bucs defense returns to respectability, which could happen after adding edge rusher Haason Reddick today and more defensive additions on the way. The Bucs made all-in moves as the free agency dinner bell chimed at noon, and Grizzard surely knows he must step up for a fan base and ownership expecting greatness. Franchise Pro Bowl quarterback, superstar young running back, elite receivers, a top-10 tight end and perhaps the NFL’s most punishing offensive line with every hog on the line 27 years old or under — Grizzard has been gifted a platinum opportunity with the Bucs expecting Godwin to make a full recovery. Joe sure hopes the young man is up to it.|2025-03-10 13:00:00|236|36|5|Josh Grizzard|High expectations for rookie Bucs playcaller amidst offensive investments.|5|Varied opinions on Grizzard's potential and the team's performance, mixed with skepticism and support.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""James west"", ""post"": ""I\u2019m pulling for ya grizzard, hope you don\u2019t turn into a chicken gizzard"", ""post_time"": [""March"", ""10th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""2:10"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Al121976"", ""post"": ""I bet Coen wished he would\u2019ve stayed and eventually took over"", ""post_time"": [""March"", ""10th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""2:11"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""Aqualung"", ""post"": ""The pressure mounts on the Defensive Coordinator.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/jason-licht-just-got-smarter-without-lifting-a-finger/|Jason Licht Just Got Smarter Without Lifting A Finger|Buried in the confetti Bucs fans are throwing while trying to process the giddy hysteria from the Bucs retaining Ben Bredeson and Chris Godwin, and agreeing to terms with Hasson Reddick in the opening minutes of legal tampering, is a transaction that has significance. In the past few days on social media, former Bucs cornerback Carlton Davis vowed never again to make what he deemed a “mistake” by not testing the free agent waters and instead, re-signing with the Bucs. Davis said he may have cheated himself out of money by not looking at other offers. The Bucs last winter shipped Davis and two sixth-round draft picks to Detroit for a third-round pick. Had Davis not been traded, he would have gone to free agency as he did this week. And this afternoon, Davis and the Patriots came to an agreement. Had the Bucs not traded Davis, they would have gotten bupkis for him after Davis agreed to play forh New England. Nothing. By trading Davis and two sixth-round picks for a third-round pick to Detroit, the Bucs used that to draft Jalen McMillen. The way McMillen played in the final games of last season it sure looks like the Bucs got an upgrade for Davis. Bucs AC/DC-loving general manager Jason Licht ended up smelling like a rose.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/jason-licht-gets-a-b-grade-for-hasson-reddick-deal/|Jason Licht Gets A “B+” For Hasson Reddick Deal|Joe cannot yet say the Bucs “signed” edge rusher Hasson Reddick for two reasons. The first reason is that nothing is official until Wednesday, the start of the new league year. The other reason is Joe is still in a state of shock the Bucs, of all teams, signed a seasoned, proven edge rusher. It’s an out-of-body experience for Joe. Feels too much like a dream. Joe hasn’t been this gleefully delirious since Antoine Winfield dropped a deuce on Cheetah Hill in February 2021. Joe isn’t the only guy who thinks Bucs AC/DC-loving general manager Jason Licht made a crazy good move by signing Reddick to a bargain-basement prove-it deal. So it is that Seth Walder of BSPN, a guy who never met a number he didn’t like, had to slap a grade on the Reddick signing. Since it’s 2025, every time an NFL team passes gas someone has to slap a grade on it. Walder likes the move for what it could mean for the Bucs defense and that the Bucs aren’t crippled if Reddick flames out. Buccaneers signing Edge Haason Reddick The deal: One year, $14 million, ($12 million guaranteed) Grade: B+ …It’s an upside play and I think it’s one worth making. … The good news for the Bucs? They don’t have to pay that much to find out — only $14 million. And they’re the sort of team that should make this risk. They’ve made the playoffs all three seasons under Todd Bowles but must have some breaks go their way to make a deep run. If Reddick gets back to the player he was … he’ll be an absolute bargain. If Reddick is even close to the player he was two years ago, this could have a major ripple effect up and down the defensive front for the Bucs’ pass rush. Think of what happened when Vita Vea, after missing months with a foot injury, returned to play against the Packers in the NFC title game in January 2021.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/critical-references-for-haason-reddick/|Critical References For Haason Reddick|So new Bucs edge rusher Haason Reddick made a lot of headlines last season for allegedly having a bad attitude about landing with the Jets after the Eagles traded him there. Reddick wanted a fat new contract, stayed home and asked for a trade. The Jets wouldn’t budge and eventually, in October, Reddick agreed to play. No surprise, he was rather invisible last season in another nightmare Jets campaign. But that history is not on the minds of folks at One Buc Palace. They believe in Reddick, and that goes beyond the $14 million he’ll be paid to chase quarterbacks this season in Tampa. Reddick was drafted by Bucco Bruce Arians in Arizona back in 2017. The first-round pick was mis-cast as an inside linebacker. And he was kept there when Arians first retired after that 2017 season. Current Bucs assistant coaches (not Todd Bowles) worked alongside Reddick and feel he’s a team guy and a hard worker. It wasn’t until 2020 that Reddick became an edge rusher and exploded. Then he moved on to Carolina and Philadelphia in free agency and continued to terrorize quarterbacks. Now the question is whether the Bucs have the same player. What Joe does know is that Reddick, 30, will be playing on a prove-it contract knowing that a good year will net him about $30 million in free agency in 2026. That’s serious motivation, if he even needs any.|2025-03-10 11:54:00|236|25|5|Haason Reddick|Reddick's history|6|Mixed reactions with optimism for Reddick's potential and concerns about defense and contracts.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""adam from ny"", ""post"": ""wow we got his for a steal\u202614 mil in these current times is still a heck of a big paycheck \u2013 but it doesn\u2019t blow out our cap"", ""post_time"": [""March"", ""10th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""12:57"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""gbobucsfan"", ""post"": ""he\u2019s 30\u2026will want one more fat contract after this year\u2026good signing, potentially great signing."", ""post_time"": [""March"", ""10th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""1:01"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""Bill Kilmer"", ""post"": ""I guess we will see, but yes has all the earmarks of how Licht likes to operate.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/the-bucs-new-fearsome-front/|The Bucs’ New Fearsome Front|UPDATED: The Bucs quietly, almost under the radar, produced one of the best front-three group of linemen in a 34 defense the league saaw in 2024. Calijah Kancey became one of the best defensive tackles in the NFL. That’s right. Not only did Kancey become a wrecking ball for sacks, he didn’t miss one tackle last regular season (per NextGen Stats). Vita Vea, his reputation precedes him. He is a beast of a tackle feared throughout the league. Logan Hall had his best season as a pro. He even got 5 1/2 sacks and became rock solid against the run. The Bucs wanted him to become the next Will Gholston and he has done that. Now? Well, the Bucs still have high hopes for edge rusher YaYa Diaby. He can still be that-guy. He has a world of talent. But now you have an edge rusher in Haason Reddick that, in the four seasons prior to 2024, had 50.5 sacks. Now the Bucs very easily can blow up to have an Eagles-like defensive front. Just think how much pressure Reddick takes off Vea and Kancey on passing plays? Teams used to gang up on Vea and Kancey and pretty much know they could have a safe pocket. No more. And now that teams will have to worry about Reddick, that likely means more single coverage on YaYa. This is what Joe has been beating up his keyboard for months about. And with the signing of Reddick, all the cards look to be falling in place for a ferocious pass rush. And nothing helps out a secondary like a pass rush. Nothing. Damn, Joe cannot believe what a great day this is!|2025-03-10 11:30:00|281|49|8|The Bucs|Dominant defensive front boosts Bucs' pass rush prowess.|8|Fans are optimistic about team moves, trust GM Licht, and look forward to more improvements.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Leopold Stotch"", ""post"": ""Take a bow Jason Licht"", ""post_time"": [""March"", ""10th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""12:32"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Oxycondomns"", ""post"": ""great day in tampa bay"", ""post_time"": [""March"", ""10th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""12:32"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""darengibo"", ""post"": ""The Licht House is shinging bright!

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/welcome-back-chris-godwin/|Welcome Back Chris Godwin!|UPDATED: The Bucs have brought back Chris Godwin. This is news only because his agent floated to someone with a lot of Twitter followers that he was headed to free agency. NFL Network says it’s a three-year, $66 million deal with incentives and $44 million guaranteed. Adam Schefter of ESPN said the Patriots were very interested in Godwin. (Now go add a year to Mike Evans’ contract in the name of decency!) When Godwin will be 100 percent healthy from his dislocated ankle remains unclear, but obviously the Bucs have no concerns. What a way to kick off free agency.

I believe with Cade Otton healthy and more of Devin Culp the Bucs can make greater use of tight ends to cover up for not using Godwin earlier in the year.  Plus a starting Bucky with more of Tucker in the short yardage situations will keep the chains moving.  Grizzard should follow the NFL trend of going for 4th and less than 2 when they have momentum and are moving the ball.  I would like to see Godwin used more vertically and running at sidelines.

And obviously Baker has shut you up ALL season long with his amazing play. But someone messed up so you are forced to use that as a Baker mess up because you have nothing else. As I said earlier PFT even said it was McMillan that ran his little route too deep. And there was a coach on the set that day and he agreed with the PFT staff, so\u2026  but I am sure you know more than everybody else. Baker must have really spanked your team in college to make you continually ignore the facts like you do, or are you just liberal? You and one other person on this blog are the ONLY people in the history of the game to ever accuse a quarterback that had a passer rating of 146.5 and a completion percentage of 83.3% of choking. That is so far beyond the pale of choking someone should write a book on the level of stupidity. Like I said earlier that is an all out spanking of Mahomes in the playoffs. He was 101.pitiful and 66%, spanking and mahomes fumbled a jet sweep just like Baker and McMillan with exception that his receiver ran a correct route. Why havent you been posting your fingers off on his fumble like you have been Bakers?? Pretty much proves you just don\u2019t like Baker. So we\u2019ll look at it that way when you post in the future. I guess Mahomes is a worse choker than Baker by your standard?? Anyway you better milk it for all it\u2019s worth because next year there  will be less mistakes and better play. Next year they won\u2019t be able to deny Baker the all Pro award. 3 years in a row in the pro bowl \ud83e\udd23 \ud83e\udd23 \ud83e\udd23  it is gettin down right embarrassing for you boys. I wonder if anyone has ever played in 5 consecutive pro bowls. Looks like old Baker could break that record too. Stay tuned!!! If they fix the defense there will be superbowl in our very near future.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/haason-reddick-to-the-bucs/|Haason Reddick To The Bucs!|Joe cannot believe it. This news has to be confirmed by someone else. It can’t be true. The Bucs signed an edge rusher??? There is a God! Per Adam Schefter, by way of NFL superagent oily Drew Rosenhaus, the Bucs will sign Haason Reddick. Joe wanted this Reddick in the worst way last year. Badly. From 2000-2023, Reddick had 50.5 sacks. Last year he tried to muscle the Jets — who traded for him from Eagles and Reddick didn’t want to go — for more loot and missed all of training camp and had a disaster of a season. Now with a fresh start in a quality organization, Joe expects Reddick to be just fine. Joe is in shock.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/d-j-chark-and-the-bucs/|D.J. Chark And The Bucs|UPDATED: Chris Godwin as re-signed with the Bucs. It’s noon! That means the NFL feeding frenzy of free agency officially has begun, though it already seems to have crashed social media and other football sites this morning. That brings Joe to the somber thought of Chris Godwin still unsigned. Will he be a Buccaneer again after a special eight-year career in Tampa? If he’s moving on, then the Bucs need a free agent receiver, Joe believes, and one that’s got more upside than Sterling Shepard, who also is a pending free agent. D.J. Chark intrigues Joe. A preseason hip injury messed up Chark last year with the Chargers. He played sparingly in their final six games but was no factor. Chark had one catch for 10 yards in their postseason loss. But Chark wasa  dynamic player prior to last season. He’s got a very high career average of 14.4 yards per catch through 212 receptions with the Jaguars, Lions and Panthers, plus four in L.A. last season. (Mike Evans’ career yards per catch is 15.2. Godwin is at 12.5) Chark turns 29 in September and was a Pro Bowler in 2019 with Gardner Minshew and Nick Foles throwing him passes on a bad Jags team. A pending free agent, Chark had a solid season for the miserable Panthers in 2023 (35 catches, 525 yards and 5 touchdowns) before Jim Harbaugh came calling for him in Los Angeles. Chark signed a one-year deal there for $3 million plus incentives. Joe is not saying Chark is a replacement for Godwin, but if the Bucs believe Chark is healthy again, then the former LSU standout with elite speed might be a very affordable and wise option.|2025-03-10 11:05:00|283|19|5|D.J.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/khalil-mack-off-the-board/|Khalil Mack Off The Board|UPDATED: The Bucs signed edge rusher Haason Reddick.  A lot of Bucs fans dreamed of beastly outside linebacker Khalil Mack coming to the Bucs. And football-wise, from all the established edge rushers, he may have been the best fit. But, like anything of quality, it costs. Well, the Chargers decided to meet Mack’s price per BSPN. Mack will sign a one-year deal with Los Angeles for some $18 million. Joe was hopeful the Bucs finally saw the light from last year, face the cold, hard truth they needed a proven edge rusher. But by watching Harold Landry and Khalil Mack, among others, sign elsewhere, that told “this Joe” the Bucs might bank on good ol’ hope for an edge rush, as usual.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/a-bucs-re-signing-and-a-long-list-of-pending-bucs-free-agents/|A Bucs Re-Signing And A Long List Of Pending Bucs Free Agents|The shrimp tacos and tots from Hooters arrive to JoeBucsFan.com world headquarters at 11:40 a.m. Joe is so fired up for the start of free agency at noon! And as founder and overall guru of ProFootballTalk.com Mike Florio noted this morning, free agency really started over the weekend. The Bucs have a long list of in-house, unrestricted free agents, guys the team is free to re-sign at any time. Bucs sacks king Shaq Barrett Kyle Trask Justin Skule Joe Tryon-Shoyinka Left guard Ben Bredeson Anthony Nelson K.J. Britt Chase Edmonds Will Gholston Chris Godwin Sterling Shepard Tavierre Thomas Mike Edwards Greg Gaines Robert Hainsey Bryce Hall Troy Hill Ryan Neal Eric Banks Royce Newman Sua Opeta But Joe will forget about them for a moment and focus on returning safety Kaevon Merriweather. Yes, per FOX Sports, the Bucs have made a deal to bring him back for 2025. Todd Bowles seems mesmerized by Merriweather’s transformation. Merriweather was cut during last season and signed onto the Lions’ practice squad. Then the Bucs brought him back two weeks later and he looked like a very different player. “Since the second half of the season when we got [Merriweather] back, he’s probably one of the smartest and most cerebral guys we have back there,” Bowles told the Buccaneers Radio Network. “The last couple of weeks of the season, he really carved out a niche for himself and [was] very consistent. I was very happy and very proud of the way he came back and played. He played like he was a 10-year vet.” Merriweather heading to Detroit and returning transformed is probably a coincidence the short amount of time he was there, but it does make Joe wonder what the future might hold for Joe Tryon-Shoyinka, who Joe hopes has a new team later this month.|2025-03-10 09:47:00|303|14|8|A Bucs Re-Signing And A Long List Of Pending Bucs Free Agents|Bucs re-sign Merriweather|5|Mixed sentiments with some optimism and some frustration about player movements and draft possibilities.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Jody"", ""post"": ""I agree Joe.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/a-peek-into-luke-goedekes-financial-future/|A Peek Into Luke Goedeke’s Financial Future|With the glorious free agency siren about to wail at noon today, Joe’s thinking a lot about Team Glazer loot. Of course, Joe remains somewhat obsessed with Graham Barton’s comments about a Luke Goedeke contract extension. So the new deal for old-man Falcons left tackle Jake Matthews had Joe’s interest. NFL Network reported yesterday that Matthews got a two-year, $45 million extension. Keep in mind Matthews is good but not great and is 33 years old, and he’s playing for a team that hasn’t had a special offense since 2018. So what will Goedeke be worth as a beastly young right tackle? When this season ends, his contract will be up and he will have just turned 27. Joe thinks what the Bucs do for pending free agent left guard Ben Bredeson, 27, will say a lot about how committed they are to keeping their ferocious offensive line together. Joe expects a Bredeson deal to pop in a matter of hours. Hopefully it’s not Jim Harbaugh signing his former player, or the Vegas Bradys swooping in.|2025-03-10 08:45:00|176|10|5|Luke Goedeke|Speculating future financial worth of NFL players.|5|Mixed sentiment with optimism and caution regarding players' contracts and performance.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""SteveK"", ""post"": ""Whatever makes it work, he\u2019s been great for us last two years back at RT.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/03/charvarius-ward/|Charvarius Ward And The Bucs|Two weeks ago at the combine, Bucs coach Todd Bowles preached about the need for “ballhawks.” He seemed embarrassed by his pass defense last year and is determined to do something about it. Now “this Joe” is down on Jamel Dean, but only because he cannot stay on the field. In particular, “this Joe” is disturbed that Dean rarely can be found on the field in crunch time in playoff games. That’s why “this Joe” wants to move on. No other reason. Well, if Bowles is looking for ballhawks, then there is a corner on the west coast that wants to put California in his rear-view mirror, and that is 49ers corner Charvarius Ward, 29. Two years ago, Ward had five picks and 23 passes defensed. Pretty good. Last year? No picks. But Joe is more than willing to give Ward a pass. Ward’s daughter, just shy of her second birthday, was very sick and was fighting for her life with a heart illness. She lost that battle in October. The loss hit Ward hard. Joe feels for the guy. His head or his heart (or both) wasn’t in the game. Joe can’t blame him one bit. Well, Ward has told the 49ers he really doesn’t want to play with them any longer. Money isn’t an issue. Rather, he told Nick Wagoner of BSPN, every time he visits the San Francisco area, he cannot get the memory of his sick little girl out of his head. “I’ve got a lot of trauma in California,” Ward said. “I had a lot of great times, but the worst thing that’s ever happened to me, that’s probably going to ever happen to me — knock on wood — happened in California. It can just bring up bad memories. Every time I get on a plane and come back to California, Santa Clara, San Jose, and show up here, it just brings up bad memories. “I go through that every day. I go home every night by myself because my girl, she doesn’t want to come back to California because of what happened. So, it is hard being alone, and she’s my strength right now. I need her, and so her not being able to be around me if I’m in California, it’d be tough.” So Ward wants a change of scenery. Maybe Tampa Bay would put his mind at ease? Mike Jones of The Athletic thinks that the Bucs may just be the right fit. Tampa Bay Buccaneers: CB Charvarius Ward The Buccaneers have a strong defensive front anchored by Vita Vea, but they really could benefit from adding a top-flight cornerback like Ward. He seems likely to depart San Francisco after a trying 2024, which included the death of his 1-year-old daughter, and could potentially benefit from a change of scenery. In 2022 and 2023, Ward never missed a game. Yes, he missed five games last year, but that was because he was dealing with his daughter’s issues. It doesn’t sound like Ward wants to retire. He just doesn’t want to play in California. Despite his personal battles, Ward doesn’t miss games and at least before last year, he was around the football.|2025-03-10 06:00:00|531|27|5|Charvarius Ward|Ward seeks change of scenery due to personal tragedy.|3|Mixed emotions, hopeful for player but also concerns about team's decisions.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Tony"", ""post"": ""SOMEBODY RIGHT NOW.
