https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/11/tristan-wirfs-still-limited-on-injury-report/|Tristan Wirfs Still “Limited” On Injury Report|So for the second conseuctive day, the Bucs only held a walk-through sesson and did not have a real practicce. Their Sunday opponent, the Panthers, have been practicing.  One approach isn’t necessarily better than another, but Todd Bowles loves going easy on his players. Regardless, the Bucs are required to post an official injury report, which represents an official guess when a team doesn’t practice. Below is the Bucs’ report. Mike Evans, who Todd Bowles and general manager Jason Licht insisted was 100 percent healthy before last Sunday’s game, remains on the injury report with his hamstring issue. Evans is listed as “full-go,” but notice how hamstring injuries for cornerbacks Jamel Dean and Zyon McCollum disappeared? Regardless, the Bucs have a short injury report for this time of year. Joe is thankful. Tristan Wirfs has been “limited” all week with a sprained knee. Joe expect Wirfs to return to the lineup Sunday in Charlotte, but it’s no given.|2024-11-28 21:34:00|158|12|7|Tristan Wirfs|Bucs injury report updates before Sunday game against Panthers.|5|Mixed sentiment with optimism and concern shown about player injuries and team performance.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""BigPoppaBuc"", ""post"": ""I hope their head is on right\u2026 this is a must win against a division opponent.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/11/murdering-the-stinking-panthers-on-third-downs/|Murdering The Stinking Panthers On Third Downs|The Bucs are behind the eight ball as far as fighting for a playoff berth. And Mike Evans is behind the eight ball when it comes to extending his record streak of 1,000-yard receiving seasons. Evans missed three games with a hamstring injury and really wasn’t fully lighting up defenses before his hamstring, either. Evans needs to average just a hair under 100 yards a game the rest of the way to keep his streak alive. That’s a high bar for a guy that defenses will clearly be trying to take out. But could that road begin Sunday? Per Rich Hribar of Sharp Football Analysis, few teams get roasted on a regular basis on third downs quite like the Stinking Panthers. While the Stinking Panthers give up the booty on third downs, the Bucs are one of the best teams in the league at converting third downs. * Tampa Bay has converted 50.4% of their third downs (2nd) and 33.3% of their third-and-long downs, the highest rate in the league. * Carolina has allowed opponents to convert a league-high 49.3% of their third downs. There you have it. And since Evans will be ganged up on, someone else ought to be open, too. Joe has to keep in mind it was the terrible Giants the Bucs faced last week. But man, Joe thought the Bucs looked crisper, sharper in the passing game. That had to be because Evans returned. Joe knows Bucs offensive coordinator Liam Coen sure thought so.|2024-11-28 12:00:00|249|23|5|Murdering The Stinking Panthers On Third Downs|Evans races to keep streak alive amidst favorable matchup.|6|Varied sentiments from optimistic to cautious with focus on winning and defensive challenges.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""MadMax"", ""post"": ""Forget the record\u2026.just stay healthy and available."", ""post_time"": [""November"", ""28th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""12:19"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""DoooshLaRue"", ""post"": ""What\u2019s our defense allowing on 3rd down?

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/11/playoff-chances-with-or-without-a-win/|Playoff Chances With Or Without A Win|Hey, you may have heard, the Bucs can’t afford to lose more than one game the rest of the way to play meaningful football in mid-January. So what are the Bucs’ chances with a win or a loss? Joe has that intel courtesy of the PFF tribe. Everybody and their brother seems to have a different calculation on the Bucs’ percentages of pulling off this feat: making the playoffs for the fifth straight season. So why not consult with the inventors of the game of football, the PFF tribe. Don’t think they know more than Bill Belichick, Andy Reid, Mike Tomlin or Bucs AC/DC-loving general manager Jason Licht? Well, just ask the tribe. With a win Sunday over the Stinking Panthers, the Bucs, per numbers cruncher Timo Riske, have a 57 percent shot of making the playoffs. But if the Bucs lose? Yikes. That percentage drops to 21 percent. No other NFC team has a postseason percentage swing that wide riding this weekend. The Bucs have no business looking ahead. At all. Todd Bowles said yesterday the Bucs are already in the playoffs in the sense they cannot afford a loss. Joe guesses most folks don’t like the Bucs’ chances of traveling to the City of Angels and beating Jim Harbaugh and the Chargers. So the other remaining five games are must-wins.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/11/bucs-fans-be-thankful-for-a-snuggly-soft-late-season-schedule/|Bucs Fans, Be Thankful For A Snuggly-Soft Late-Season Schedule|OK, since it is Thanksgiving, you’ve got to have a Thanksgiving story, right? It’s the law, ain’t it? You know, like an 11th commandment? So Jeffri Chadiha of NFL.com decided to type a piece earlier this week looking at what every NFL team has to be thankful for. And Chadiha believes Bucs fans ought to give thanks to the almighty NFL strongman Roger Goodell for giving them a pumpkin-pie-soft schedule the rest of the way to keep the Bucs in the playoff hunt. The remainder of the schedule. If there’s one reason to feel good about the Buccaneers — a team that had lost four straight games and five of its last six coming into this past weekend — it has to be the remaining slate of opponents. They just beat up on the Giants on Sunday coming off a Week 11 bye, and they’re only set to face one more team that currently owns a winning record (the Chargers). That’s the second-easiest schedule left in the league for a Tampa Bay team that is currently sitting at 5-6.  … “This Joe” is still uncomfortable how so many people both inside and outside of One Buc Palace think the Bucs can rip off six wins out of seven games, take over the division and make the playoffs. Could the Bucs do that? Sure. It’s just not something “this Joe” would lay any cash on. Is Joe hopeful? Of course. But Joe also lives in the real world. One slip up to someone like the Stinking Panthers on Sunday and this team is on the edge of doom.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/11/happy-thanksgiving-16/|Happy Thanksgiving|Joe sincerely wishes all readers (and the haters who are addicted to this here site) all the best today on one of Joe’s favorite holidays. In the list of holidays, Joe gives Thanksgiving a strong No. 2, just a step behind the Fourth of July. On what other day is unbridled gluttony and drunkenness embraced and celebrated like on Thanksgiving, with football on the tube all day long? What other day (and night) are you encouraged to eat like a hungry dog and drink like a thirsty fish while enjoying football from noon until nearly midnight? The first things we can be thankful for? A decent Bucs football team. Next of course is that the NFC South stinks. The Bucs are still in the playoff chase. Joe is very thankful for that, too. So, yeah, this is Joe’s kinda day. Food, alcohol and football. This is Thanksgiving Day. There’s no real reason to ever get off the couch except to shovel more turkey, dressing and pumpkin pie down your gullet, or to grab an(other) adult beverage or, well, you know, take care of personal business that comes thereafter. Joe has a lot for which to be thankful, but nothing is more important than Joe’s readers. If not for readers just like you, there’s no telling what Joe would be doing for a living — heck, maybe even doing time. This here corner of the Interwebs certainly would not exist without loyal, faithful readers. Joe never loses sight of that important fact. Thank you all! Now, bye-bye belt!

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/11/better-run-game-a-team-effort/|Better Run Game A Team Effort|The Bucs’ running attack has literally been a night-and-day difference this year. Last year Rachaad White ran like he read holes using Braille. Of course, his playcaller was allergic to at least using him to run behind Tristan Wirfs, which is a mystery Joe still cannot solve. This year with the addition of rookie Bucky Irving, maybe a little better blocking across the entire line and an offensive coordinator who has an idea what he’s doing with a run game, the Bucs have exploded with a ground attack. Last year the Bucs were a trash running team, dead-last in the NFL in total rushing yards and yards-per-carry. This year? The Bucs are No. 10 in rushing yards and No. 4 in yards per carry. That’s an incredible turnaround with pretty much the same players other than two offensive linemen and a new running back. Of course, the easy answer to the vastly improved run game is the addition of Bucky Irving. Yesterday Bucs coach Todd Bowles, while not dissing Irving, said there are a lot of moving puzzle pieces that have ignited the Bucs running attack. “You attribute it to the offensive line, you attribute it to the coaching staff, you attribute it to the running backs, tight ends, [wide] receivers blocking,” Bowles said. “It’s all-inclusive. It’s going to be different every ballgame. We’ve got to keep it up and keep at it.” Well, Irving sure hasn’t hurt. The guy is the total opposite of White in making guys miss. Between the tackles, White couldn’t make a mailbox miss. For Irving, that’s his specialty. And once he gets past a tackler, look the eff out! High standards! Aside from White, the biggest improvement Joe has seen is that this year the Bucs are willing to run behind perhaps the best left tackle in the game. Weird, isn’t it?|2024-11-28 00:00:00|308|26|7|Bucky Irving|Bucs transform run game with teamwork and new additions.|4|Mixed sentiments with varying opinions on players and coaches, some positive and some critical.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Buc1987"", ""post"": ""And the fans chant Buuuucky!"", ""post_time"": [""November"", ""28th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""12:25"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""David"", ""post"": ""It is an incredible turnaround, but I would hardly say mostly the same personal- \u201cThat\u2019s an incredible turnaround with pretty much the same players other than two offensive linemen and a new running back.\u201d and a new OC That is almost half the core group involved.
