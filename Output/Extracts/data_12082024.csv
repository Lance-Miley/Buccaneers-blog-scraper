https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/the-no-3-seed-is-in-play/|The No. 3 Seed Is In Play|While some Bucs fans are skeptical Tampa Bay will make the playoffs, despite leading the NFC South with a 7-6 record, Joe is looking up at the chances of scoring a No. 3 seed in the NFC playoffs. That’s right, No. 3. The Bucs lead the Falcons by one game in the division and currently hold that No. 4 NFC seed with four games remaining. Seattle is 8-5 and a game ahead of the Bucs as the NFC West leader and No. 3 seed. The Bucs have three snuggly-soft opponents remaining on their schedule. But Seattle? They’ve got the Packers (9-4) and Vikings (11-2) at home, plus the Bears (4-9) and Rams (7-6) on the road. That’s a brutal closing slate. But more important, Seattle is 4-4 against NFC opponents while the Bucs are 6-3. If the Bucs and Seahawks each win their division and have the same final record, the tiebreaker to determine playoff seeding would be won-lost record within the conferece. So the Bucs are looking strong with one remaining out-of-conference game against the Chargers, and NFC games against the Cowboys, Saints and Panthers, a trio that’s combined for 13 total wins.|2024-12-08 22:24:00|194|27|6|Joe|Bucs aim for No. 3 seed in NFC playoffs.|3|Uncertainty and skepticism regarding playoff chances and team performance.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""SteelStudBuc"", ""post"": ""4th"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""8th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""10:25"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Mac"", ""post"": ""Just hoping we get in.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/why-the-passing-game-may-have-bogged-down/|Why The Passing Game May Have Bogged Down|After the Bucs jumped out to a 14-0 lead, the offense, for whatever reason, seemed stuck in the mud. If the Bucs weren’t turning the ball over, they were punting. Baker Mayfield didn’t have a great game. He had four sacks and a pair of picks. So why did the Bucs’ passing game vanish until late? Jalen McMillan believes it was the Raiders’ pass rush. “I want to say just a lot of defense was getting home,” McMillan said. “We didn’t have a lot of time to run routes so we needed to just run our routes faster, come off the line faster, make sure we got open faster.” At about the same time the Bucs had trouble throwing the ball in the middle two quarters, it was clear that it was a rough day for the offensive line. That unit may have had its worst pass-blocking game of the season. Whatever the Raiders were doing on their defensive front to confuse and overrun the Bucs offensive line, well, Joe is pretty confident Chargers defensive coordinator Jesse Minter is going to throw that at the Bucs in Los Angeles next week.|2024-12-08 21:57:00|191|28|3|Passing Game Troubles|Bucs offense struggles against Raiders' pass rush.|2|Comments express concerns about turnovers, penalties, and offensive struggles, with mixed optimism about the team.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""BigPoppaBuc"", ""post"": ""A few penalties and some not so successful runs had us in third and long a lot.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/gamechanger-tykee-smith/|Gamechanger Tykee Smith|So the Raiders came out of the halftime break today and marched on the Bucs to the tune of a 15-play drive that ate up about 10 minutes. Joe was about ready to sprint to a toilet. What did the Bucs do at halftime, eat cookie dough? This was the Raiders and backup QB Aidan O’Connell, not a good offense. But the next play on 2nd-and-8 at the Bucs’ 10 yard line was a beautiful interception in very tight space by rookie third-round pick Tykee Smith. Back from a bad knee bruise, Smith was sharp today. And all season he’s forced turnovers and made impact plays. Without a shred of sarcasm, Joe can say this red-zone pick may have been his biggest play of the season, with the Bucs leading 14-10 and an ominous hush having overtaken The Licht House. Smith played the underneath throw perfectly and patiently, not getting too hyped and drawing a flag with a push of the receiver. Smith jumped the route smoothly and his hands were money. (Video below.) In just nine games, the rookie has two interceptions and three forced fumbles, and he’s tied for the team lead in both categories. Plus, Smith had another forced fumble wrongly taken away from him by referees. What a Round 3 snag by Buccaneers Ring of Honor General manager Jason Licht! When Smith is on the field, it feels like the Bucs can do more defensively, in addition to executing better than without him.|2024-12-08 21:57:00|247|23|8|Tykee Smith|Rookie Tykee Smith shines with game-changing interception for Buccaneers.|6|Varied opinions ranging from optimism to frustration and critiques of players and officiating.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""ElioT"", ""post"": ""\u201cThe best rookie on the field today was the Bucs\u2019 No. 23, not superstar tight end Graham Barton\u201d ???"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""8th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""10:03"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Jimm"", ""post"": ""What\u2019s the chances tykee wins DROY ?"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""8th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""10:04"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""MF Bucs"", ""post"": ""Check your captions Joe"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""8th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""10:05"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter3"": {""username"": ""Jbeachbuc"", ""post"": ""What kind of throw was that tho\u2026.?

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/ira-kaufmans-10-takeaways-from-bucs-raiders-2/|Ira Kaufman’s 10 Takeaways From Bucs-Raiders|BY IRA KAUFMAN As he reached for the Buc locker room door, with the Glazers lined up inside to greet him, YaYa Diaby spoke loud and clear for all to hear: “First place, baby, first place.” That kind of says it all as the Bucs vaulted to the top of the NFC South Sunday by beating the Raiders while the reeling Falcons were blitzed in Minnesota. All it took was three consecutive wins after the bye, coupled with Atlanta’s 4-game losing streak. Buc fans had to be both surprised and delighted by a stellar defensive effort that limited Las Vegas to 13 points and 286 yards. Injuries to Antoine Winfield Jr. and rookie sensation Bucky Irving didn’t deter the Bucs, who won despite three giveaways by Baker Mayfield. Todd Bowles had the right answers for rookie tight end Brock Bowers, who entered the game leading the league in receptions. Bowers caught only three passes for 49 yards and was never a major factor as the Raiders suffered their ninth consecutive setback. Irving gained only three yards before leaving with a back injury, but Tampa Bay’s surging ground game still rumbled for 152 yards. Rachaad White led the way with 90 yards, scoring once on the ground and once through the air. It was a big day for Buc rookies as Jalen McMillan caught a pair of TD passes and Tykee Smith registered an interception and two passes defended. Lavonte David led the defensive charge with seven tackles, a sack and a fumble recovery. Kaevon Merriweather was active all afternoon with seven stops and a sack on a day Oakland converted only 4-of-13 on third down. Mayfield started fast, throwing for 110 yards and a pair of scores in the opening quarter. The offense then bogged down in a major way as the offensive line struggled to protect Mayfield, who was picked off twice and also lost a fumble. The Raiders crept within 14-10 at the half and reached the Buccaneer 10 on the opening drive of the third quarter before Smith shadowed Bowers and intercepted Aidan O’Connell. Tampa Bay’s offense continued to plod along until Mayfield directed a 77-yard drive, highlighted by a 32-yard strike to Mike Evans and Sean Tucker’s 34-yard run that set up White’s 3-yard TD dash. Desmond Ridder, replacing an injured O’Connell, led a long drive capped by Daniel Carlson’s 27-yard FG with 3:05 left before the Bucs finished off the outcome in dynamic style. With the Bucs ahead 21-13, Cade Otton hauled in a 44-yard pass, dragging defenders for extra yardage. On third down, Mayfield beat the blitz by finding McMillan all alone in the right flat for a 29-yard score. Here’s how Tampa Bay reached the division summit by downing the Raiders 28-13: * The Bucs won’t be playing the Giants, Panthers or Raiders in Week 14. Next up is a trip to Los Angeles to face Jim Harbaugh’s Chargers, one of the NFL’s most physical teams. The Falcons play the reeling Raiders the following evening, so Tampa Bay will probably need to win to stay on top. * The Bucs couldn’t have asked for a better start, going up 14-0 after only 11 minutes. While Mayfield was sizzling, the Raiders gained one first down and 14 yards on their first two possessions. * White ran with fury and vision, topped by a classic stiff arm as he was approaching the left sidelines. The Bucs needed him to step up in Irving’s absence and he obliged — with a key contribution from Tucker. “Man, the big guys came out on fire out of the gate,” said White, who had his most productive rushing day since last December at Atlanta. * Calijah Kancey got away with a lapse in judgment on the play O’Connell hurt his knee. He shoved the Oakland quarterback to the ground well after the pass had left O’Connell’s hand. Somehow, the officials kept their flags in their pockets, failing to acknowledge an obvious penalty. * Tristan Wirfs said he enjoyed his battle against Raiders stud defensive end Maxx Crosby, who also lined up often against Luke Goedeke. Both of Tampa Bay’s tackles did a nice job on Crosby, who finished with two tackles and one QB hit. * Here’s the way Tampa Bay’s next six possessions went after taking a 14-0 lead: interception, fumble, punt, interception, punt and punt. The Raiders kept hanging around, but the embattled Buc defense would not allow the visitors to spring an upset. * For much of the game, the crowd supplied little juice for the home team. Buc fans can do better — and they will. * Mayfield’s final passing numbers (295 yards, 3 TDs), are impressive, but his knack for ball security has slipped in recent weeks. He has thrown 11 picks in the past eight games, giving opponents short fields and robbing the Bucs of momentum. * The 1,000-yard streak of Mike Evans is in serious jeopardy heading into the final month of the regular season. With 590 yards, Evans needs to average at least 102.5 yards the rest of the way to post his 11th consecutive 1,000-yard season. * Liam Coen’s attack has been carrying this team most of the year. That wasn’t the case on Sunday, when the youngry Buc defense rose to the occasion. It was a very gratifying effort for Bowles and a confidence booster for the team before the Bucs head cross-country. |2024-12-08 18:31:00|904|31|7|Ira Kaufman's 10 Takeaways From Bucs-Raiders|Bucs rise to NFC South's top spot after defeating Raiders.|4|Mixed sentiments with some frustration and optimism towards the team's performance and players.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""ModHairKen"", ""post"": ""Throw the ball to Mike Evans."", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""8th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""6:44"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Tom M Sumner"", ""post"": ""JUST WIN BABY!!!"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""8th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""6:50"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""Darin"", ""post"": ""Of course the bucs fans can do better.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/the-return-of-sean-tucker/|The Return Of Sean Tucker|Since Sean Tucker went nuts against the slimy Saints, running for 136 yards, the Bucs have put him on ice. Since that New Orleans game, Tucker had 14 carries for 26 yards. Until today. Tucker hurt the Raiders for 47 yards on three carries, including a key 34-yard run in the fourth quarter. He did it in place of Bucky Irving, who messed up his back and sat about two-thirds of the game. Bucs coach Todd Bowles was pretty impressed with Tucker’s production. “It’s a luxury that we are pretty lucky to have,” Bowles said of Tucker. “Not many teams have three guys that you kind of just can plug and play. They are all different backs and good at their own thing. “But having Sean come in there and add some physical runs in the gap game and be able to bounce the ball and create an explosive – that was huge for us.” Tucker’s run seemed to ignite the Bucs offense, which had been in a funk highlighted by turnovers. Having Tucker come off the bench somewhat fresh to jump-start the offense could become a huge weapon for the Bucs, especially with a beat up Irving.|2024-12-08 18:25:00|198|22|9|Sean Tucker|Tucker impresses with key runs|5|Mixed sentiment on players' performances, team dynamics, and coaching decisions.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Kenton Smith"", ""post"": ""4 more games is alot of season left to play.

You’ve heard the term “dropping like flies” to describe injuries, right? Well, that’s what is happening to the Bucs. The second and third levels of the Bucs defense has been ravaged by injuries. The Bucs are currently pulling dudes off the street if they ever played for Bucs coach Todd Bowles. Even fan favorite Ryan Neal was put on the practice squad. It’s getting that bad. And today, Antoine Winfield went down with a knee injury. “That’s always been me, to help out however I can,” David said. “And that’s what I did today. “Vi [Jones] game in and stepped up big time for us, made some big plays.” As for the Bucs now being in first place, David said he can’t get too worked up about that. Too much football left to start counting chickens. “Not [be] worried about what’s going on outside [the locker room],” David said about how the team regained the lead in the NFC South. “And just worry about and taking care of what’s going on in here.” The Bucs have two more road games, at Los Angeles (Chargers) and at Dallas and then close the season out with two division games at home: Carolina and New Orleans. Will three wins be enough to lock up the division?

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/just-win-baby-4/|Just Win Baby|Somewhere, Al Davis would be appalled at what has happened to his beloved Raiders. The Raiders have now, thanks to the Bucs, lost nine straight. Davis would have been so enraged he very likely would have had dead-man-walking Raiders coach Antonio Pierce fly home from Tampa commercial. And when Pierce returned to his office in suburban Las Vegas, he’d find his office cleaned out. The Bucs played sloppy, largely uninspired football today. The Raiders were worse. They seemed sunk when quarterback Aidan O’Connell suffered a leg injury in the third quarter. Specifics of the injury are unknown but Pierce said the injury “doesn’t look good.” The Bucs then seemed to wake up and took control of the game. Bucs coach Todd Bowles wasn’t concerned with aesthetics, he said after the game. A win is a win and that’s all that matters. When Bowles was asked about Baker Mayfield’s bad day, Bowles explained it doesn’t matter so long as you win. The Bucs lost a fumble and Mayfield threw two picks. Joe understands the Bucs may get away with that playing the trash Raiders. It’s unlikely the Bucs win with three turnovers in Los Angeles next week facing the Chargers. It’s all about winning. As Davis was famous for saying, “Just win, baby.” The Bucs did just that today.  |2024-12-08 18:09:00|218|14|3|Raiders|Raiders suffer ninth straight loss in sloppy game against Bucs.|4|Mixed sentiment with some optimism but also negativity and criticism prevalent in the comments.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""ModHairKen"", ""post"": ""They won.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/sterling-shepards-biggest-day-since-the-2022-opener/|Sterling Shepard’s Biggest Day Since The 2022 Opener|Yeah, yeah, two touchdown catches today for rookie Jalen McMillan. That was sweet, though Todd Bowles wanted McMillan to take a knee on the late TD rather than score.  Joe hopes that success sparks McMillan, who sometimes doesn’t seem in lockstep with Baker Mayfield. However, Joe is here now to celebrate veteran receiver Sterling Shepard, who “this Joe” will declare as the Bucs’ current No. 2 receiver with Chris Godwin lost for the season. What a free agent pickup Shepard has been. Shepard caught 4 balls today for 63 yards, his greatest yardage production since opening day of the 2022 season. In Week 3 of 2022, Shepard tore his ACL (knee) and was lost the rest of the season. In 2023, he seemed totally washed, catching just 10 balls and looking like a 30-year-old receiver about to be unwanted. The 2024 free agency calls weren’t there — or weren’t realistic — until Baker Mayfield picked up the phone. Shepard, 31, got hurt again this summer and started this season on the practice squad. Now, he’s caught 29 balls from Mayfield and 13 in the last three games. He’s become a critical chains-mover for the Tampa Bay offense. Joe’s a big Shepard fan and Joe also is starting to believe Shepard is just now getting fully healthy after that ACL. It often takes a receiver two years to get right. That could be a special reality for the Bucs offense. While Shepard doesn’t have significant postseason experience after eight years with the miserable Giants, he’s proven in Tampa to be a big-moments receiver when he’s not committing penalties. Shepard’s 400-plus career catches could prove to be very valuable experience in the playoffs.|2024-12-08 18:08:00|281|18|7|Sterling Shepard|Veteran receiver excels|6|Mixed sentiment with optimism for some players and frustration with coaching decisions.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""ModHairKen"", ""post"": ""Shepard looked great.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/todd-bowles-wins-the-hot-seat-trifecta/|Todd Bowles Wins The Hot-Seat Trifecta|He did it! Todd Bowles pulled it off. And Joe has to give a standing ovation. The Bucs’ head coach found himself entering last month’s bye week with a 4-6 record. So many close losses, so many coaching decisions to question, so many soft-zone-defense nightmares. Legions of Bucs fans were rattled. Joe included. How does a team that spanked the Lions in Detroit and throttled the Eagles enter a bye week at 4-6? Blame the head coach. Off with his head! Joe heard the drumbeats on local sports radio and fielded the nasty emails, and deleted hundreds of off-color comments that never reached these pages. Hey, that’s the NFL. Teams want fans to be engaged and fired up year-round, so the result is rabid lunatics looking for blood, from opponents or their own. The only fix for Bowles was to go out and win the next three games against the Giants, Panthers and Raiders. That would get national media off his back and restore faith in legions of Bucs fans. Find a way. Figure it out. Man up. Get the job done. This team was/is good enough to have a winning record. And here we are. The Bucs sit alone in first place at 7-6. The preseason-hyped Falcons are crying in their beers. Bowles called today’s victory “a sign of maturity.” Joe agrees. The Bucs let the Raiders creep back in the game but slammed the door very hard. This was no Anthony Nelson miracle; it was a physical ending for a head coach that’s weaved his way to 7-6 with a lot of room for improvement.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/baker-mayfield-turnover-machine-thrill-ride/|Baker Mayfield: Turnover Machine & Thrill Ride|Joe will dare say that Baker Mayfield is looking like a winner version of Jameis Winston in recent weeks, including today. It’s been a roller coaster experience, an Iron Gwazi ride 20 minutes south of Busch Gardens. Two more interceptions for Mayfield today came against the bumbling Raiders, and they can’t be blamed on receivers. Mayfield has 13 picks this season, which is three more than his 2023 total, and he’s throwing less per game — and going deep less. Mayfield also has 28 touchdown passes after three more today: two sent to Jalen McMillian and one to Rachaad White. That’s as many as Mayfield had last year and it ties his career high with four games to play. The Bucs’ franchise quarterback also made a huge throw to Mike Evans in the fourth quarter on a huge third-down play, a laser in crunch time. Mayfield was unhappy after the game about his interceptions and a lost fumble. Todd Bowles mentioned the fumble, too. But that’s the beauty of this wacky Bucs team. They’re in first place at 7-6 with a dangerous offense — and they have lots of potential improvement on the table. Joe’s not worried about Mayfield. He was a stud in the playoffs last season, and Joe expects that will happen again.|2024-12-08 17:25:00|215|38|3|Baker Mayfield|Up and down performance but optimism for improvement.|3|Mixed opinions on Baker Mayfield's performance, some critical, others supportive or neutral.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""#1bucsfan"", ""post"": ""I\u2019m a baker fan but this is why I don\u2019t think he\u2019s an elite QB.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/rachaad-white-comes-to-the-rescue/|Rachaad White Comes To The Rescue|NFL coaches always talk about the next man up when players go down. Today, one could argue that was running back Rachaad White. White, with Bucky Irving shelved early with an injured back, had to shoulder the load. And he came through. White had 109 yards from scrimmage with 90 yards rushing and 19 through the air. White scored two touchdowns, one on the ground and one receiving, the NFL game in which he caught and ran for a TD in the same game. The Bucs offense was sluggish through much of the game. White did his best to spark it when, late in the third quarter, he ran left and blasted Raiders rookie corner Decamerion Richardson with a ferocious stiff-arm very much like he did in the Bucs’ win at Munich two years ago over the Seahawks. Joe was stoked! White’s tough three-yard run through traffic up the middle gave the Bucs a 21-13 lead with 8:47 left in regulation. After the game, he didn’t seem interested in talking about the Bucs regaining first place in the NFC South with four games left. “It feels good just to get a win and be on a winning streak,” White said. “We’re just focused on who we have next.” After White’s touchdown run, the Raiders never seemed to bounce back. Playing with backup quarterback dismal Desmond Ridder after Aidan O’Connell was carted off, the Raiders never could recover from White’s second score. So today there were all sorts of players with the opportunity to break the glass ceiling with the next man up marching orders. It was White who did just that.|2024-12-08 17:19:00|271|19|8|Rachaad White|White shines in NFL game|5|Mixed sentiment with some optimism regarding the run game and player performances, but also some frustration.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""firethecannons"", ""post"": ""So it seems we have our run game corrected!

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/weve-accepted-that-reality/|“We’ve Accepted That Reality”|So this isn’t your 2023 Buccaneers. This team is ready to punish defenses with brute force. Center Graham Barton talked to Joe after today’s thrilling win against the Raiders, after Joe talked to another couple of offensive linemen. Yeah, those guys took a bit of a beating from the Raiders’ pass rush, but the line was again a punishing force as the Bucs ran for 26 carries for 152 yards, including a touchdown. Barton wasn’t in Tampa the past two seasons, but he knows how much becoming a running team was stressed since the day he showed up in April. “We’ve accepted that reality,” Barton said about the Bucs becoming a run-heavy, run-it-when-we-want-to team. That’s the identity the line strives to have, per Barton, and the success is undeniable. Sure, the Bucs couldn’t finish off a key 3rd-and-1 last week at Carolina and lost four yards, but that wasn’t happening today, and Tampa Bay got it done without Bucky Irving. He got hurt and had just four carries for 3 yards. It was Rachaad White and Sean Tucker carrying the mail for a combined 20 carries for 137 yards. “I think every offensive line in the world will tell you they want to run the ball a lot, and we’re earning that trust from [Liam Coen] and building and growing as the season goes along,” Barton said. “We’ve got excellent running backs.” Joe was impressed. The Raiders are a defense-first team that entered the game ranked ninth in the NFL in yards per carry allowed. That ranking is about to sink hard.|2024-12-08 17:06:00|262|41|8|Graham Barton|Buccaneers adopt run-heavy identity|2|Mixed sentiments with negativity towards certain players, positivity towards recent wins, and frustration at criticism.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""TheBucsAnthem"", ""post"": ""We\u2019ve accepted why Baker Poo Poo \ud83d\udca9  was released by 3 different teams before after another poopy game!"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""8th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""5:09"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""ModHairKen"", ""post"": ""White was outstanding today."", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""8th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""5:10"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""ModHairKen"", ""post"": ""And we have crybaby Bucs Anthem.

Tampa Bay started hot with a 14-0 lead in the first quarter and then fell apart but rebounded courtesy of a huge red-zone interception by Tykee Smith, plus big explosive plays by Mike Evans and Sean Tucker in the fourth quarter. Those two chunk plays by the offense sparked a Rachaad White touchdown run to give the Bucs a 21-10 lead. Joe thought that was the ballgame, but in came dismal Desmond Ridder, the Raiders’ third-string QB, and he carved up the Bucs for a field goal drive. Huge tackles by Kaevon Merriweather and Christian Izien kept the Raiders out of the end zone. Big-time plays. Joe is damn proud of that Smith pick. Great body adjustment awareness. It was his first game back after a knee injury and he brings a special element that cannot be replaced at nickel cornerback. And how about Sean Tucker bouncing back from two fumbles in New Jersey against the Giants to get a shot with Bucky Irving leaving injured! Tucker’s patient run and explosiveness was a thing of beauty for 34 yards. The Bucs put their foot back on the gas late in the fourth quarter for a late TD pass to rookie Jalen McMillan, his second touchdown catch of the day. Joe also is giving a standing ovation for Rachaad White, 17 carries for 90 yards and a rushing TD — plus 2 catches for 19 yards and a TD catch. The Bucs’ three-headed monster at running back has returned, and they might need all of them if Irving’s back injury lingers. First place, Bucs fans!

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/betting-the-bucs-week-14-edition/|Betting The Bucs (Week 14 Edition)|So Joe’s season-long record is 10-10 in Bucs-related picks after last Sunday’s bumpy ride against Carolina.  “Betting the Bucs” reveals where Joe is throwing cash within today’s Buccaneers game. Of course, it’s only Joe’s pregame picks, not in-game wagers. (Sports betting is legal in Florida but there’s only one government-regulated Florida sportsbook monopoly run by the Seminole tribe. That’s where Joe gets the betting lines.) Good luck!  Bucky Irving Over 3.5 catches (+120) — So Joe sees the Bucs getting back to their relatively dormant screen game today against the Raiders and Maxx Crosby. And Joe also sees the Bucs preferring to give Bucky Irving touches without slamming his bad hip/back into the line of scrimmage. Irving has caught three or more balls in each of the last six games.  Mike Evans Over 5.5 catches (+105) — Joe will continue to ride this because continuing Mike Evans’ streak of 1,000-yard receiving seasons is very important to everyone at One Buc Palace. Evans had 12 targets last week and caught 8, and he strongly implied he’s healthier now than he was seven days ago.    Raiders QB Aidan O’Connell Over 35.5 Pass Attempts (-125) — So manbeast Bucs defensive tackle Vita Vea was invisible last Sunday and he rarely has two bad games in a row. Combine that with Raiders ranking last in the NFL in yards per carry, and Joe sees the Raiders abandoning the run game early. And frankly, why wouldn’t any team attacking the Bucs focus on passing the ball? Surely, the Raiders have seen Tampa Bay’s soft pass defense. O’Connell played well and attempted 35 passes against the Chiefs last week.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/emphatic-sage-bucs-will-be-alone-tonight-in-first-place/|Emphatic Sage: Bucs Will Be Alone Tonight In First Place|So listeners to Friday’s Ira Kaufman Podcast heard The Sage of Tampa Bay Sports offer to bet any Bucs fan $20 that Tampa Bay will be alone atop the NFC South standings by dinnertime tonight.  The struggling Falcons, tied with the Bucs at 6-6, head today to the mighty Vikings (10-2) for a 1 o’clock kickoff. Their insane crowd will be eager to beat old man quarterback Kirk Cousins in his return to Minneapolis. Simultaneously, the Bucs host the two-win Raiders, a team in turmoil with a backup quarterback starting, a club that’s playing a ton of first- and second-year players. Kaufman, as he’s said for weeks, is a believer in the Buccaneers and expects them to beat the Raiders and close the season strong winning 10 or 9 games. The Falcons? Kaufman isn’t expecting them to have a winning record when the dust settles in January. So Sage Ira, in his 40th year covering the Bucs, went out of his way to tell Bucs fans they’ll be sitting pretty this evening with a completely clear path to their fourth consecutive division title. Joe loves the firm, bang-the-table optimism. It feels great. So would a win against the Raiders. Man, what a stunning division comeback Kaufman’s scenario would represent.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/will-home-cooking-return/|Will Home Cooking Return?|No, Joe is not resurrecting the “Den of Depression” nickname for the Bucs’ home turf on Dale Mabry Highway, the cathedral now known pridefully as The Licht House. The Bucs didn’t have a winning record at home in any season from 2009 through Bucco Bruce Arians’ first year in 2019. And the nickname evolved while the Bucs lost every home game in 2015, including tanking that season’s finale to secure the draft rights to Jameis Winston. Joe vowed to retire “Den of Depression” the moment the Bucs had a winning record in Tampa in a given season. That joy arrived January 3, 2021. However, the importance of winning at home hasn’t changed. Arians preached it and strong teams generally find an edge from the support of home fans and by avoiding travel. So Joe is extra eager today to see how the Bucs respond on their home turf. Why? Because Tampa Bay has a 2-4 record at home this season and hasn’t played before the Bucs faithful since Nov. 10. Home cooking should matter. Joe expects it will for today’s 1 o’clock kickoff against the Raiders. The Bucs were 4-4 on Tampa soil during the 2022 and 2023 regular seasons. They’ve got three games remaining at home to get to 5-4 for 2024: Raiders, Saints and Panthers. |2024-12-08 03:09:00|217|16|6|Joe|Bucs aim for better home record|3|Mixed sentiment towards the team's performance at home, fan support, and coaching under Bowles.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Ryan"", ""post"": ""Joe\u2013forgot to ask this on the Mike Evan\u2019s Walter Payton nominee post.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/bounceback-game-for-baker-mayfield/|Bounceback Game For Baker Mayfield|If you believe in the law of averages, then you likely are confident that Baker Mayfield will have a strong game today. Mayfield didn’t have a great game last Sunday in Charlotte, despite the Bucs winning in overtime. Mayfield also got dinged up and Joe believes one of his picks was directly related to his injury — as he came straight from the peep show tent and Bucs offensive coordinator Liam Coen had him throw on that very first play. Pick! In fact Mayfield, who has been one of the NFL’s best quarterbacks this season, had poor accuracy last week as documented by Rich Hribar of Sharp Football Analysis. His 18.2% inaccurate throw rate was his highest rate in a game this season. And Mayfield completed just 62.6 percent of his throws against the Stinking Panthers. That was his his lowest completion percentage in a game since Week 2 at Detroit (also a Bucs win) and his second-worst of the season for a QB completing more than 70 percent of his total passes this year. So if you believe Mayfield nearly bottomed out last week, then that means he will have a much better game today.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/the-brock-bowers-challenge/|The Brock Bowers Challenge|Joe has a hunch that Brock Bowers may as well be a wide receiver today because he’s likely going to get the most targets for the Raiders against the Bucs at The Licht House. The Raiders are a trash team. Minority owner Tom Brady probably doesn’t even list them on his resume he’s so ashamed (but not ashamed of the revenue stream). It is a safe bet the Raiders will have a new coach shortly after Black Monday (Mike Vrabel?). But the Raiders do have one seriously talented weapon on offense. And it’s a position that has given the Bucs fits this year with their soft defense in the middle (which is now softer since practice squad dude Vi Jones will likely start). Joe really believes Bowers, a leading candidate for Offensive Rookie of the Year, will get a ton of targets today. So many that Joe wouldn’t be shocked if Bucs corners will have to tangle with him. Bowers is a big dude. He’s 6-3, 243. That’s like trying to guard and/or bring down a truck. So Joe asked Bucs corner Jamel Dean how he plans to tangle with Bowers if the two cross paths. “To bring a [big] guy down you always have to go for his legs,” Dean said. “And then hold on for dear life.” Joe can sympathize. For a corner, Dean is good-sized. He’s not Bowers’ big. “Guarding [a big tight end], you have to mix up your technique,” Dean told Joe. “[Bowers is] a guy that can run and he’s big enough to throw you. “So you have to mix it up.” The Bucs seem to be so vulnerable if Joe was with the Raiders, he’d even have Mike Mayer — no small guy himself at 6-4, 265, a second-round pick from 2023 out of Notre Dame, cruising in the middle too. Bucs icon Lavonte David is going to have to have a whale of a game today. Somehow, someway, the Bucs are going to have to find a way to slow down Bowers.|2024-12-08 00:11:00|340|7|3|Brock Bowers|Raiders face Bucs|4|Mixed opinions on defensive strategy and Todd Bowles, acknowledging Raiders' potential.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Rod Munch"", ""post"": ""Here\u2019s an idea, since they\u2019re a one player offense, put two on that one.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/bucky-irving-makes-us-right/|Bucky Irving “Makes Us Right”|So in the past week, twice, Bucs running back sensation Bucky Irving, who isn’t fully comfortable dealing with the Tampa Bay pen and mic club, has pleaded with throngs of local media to instead pay more attention to the Bucs’ offensive line and to give them some love. Joe tries. Joe talks to offensive linemen and writes about them. Those guys generally like to talk and often have interesting things to say. So last week Joe spoke to center Graham Barton and right guard Cody Mauch. Interestingly, when Joe asked them about Irving, both had the exact same thing to say. And Joe believes they were genuine, not coached up by the Bucs media relations staff. “Bucky makes us right,” Barton told Joe on Wednesday. On Thursday, Mauch echoed Barton. “If we end up missing a block, he makes us right,” Mauch said. And both men’s faces lit up when Joe asked about Irving. “Just how elusive he is,” Barton raved about Irving. “He is hard to bring down. We like having him. He can extend plays. We appreciate him a lot.” When Joe asked Mauch about Irving’s ability to force missed tackles, Mauch raved. “Oh, it’s unreal,” Mauch said. “He makes us look so good. … He has been fun to watch.” And Irving also is fun for those guys — fun to block for a player like that. Coen likes to set up WHAM blocks to help spring Irving (and Rachaad White, too). And Mauch is all for a WHAM block, where he gets to pull and blast a defender trying to burst through a hole. “Yeah, they’re always fun,” Mauch said with his toothless grin. “You look forward to that.” Barton noted he believes Irving makes the offense hum. When Irving is getting chunks of yards, it benefits the entire offense. “He’s a really talented player,” Barton said. “We are lucky to have him.” Joe thinks Irving is having such a good past six weeks or so, his name ought to be brought up in Offensive Rookie of the Year chatter. It’s not, but Irving sure has support from teammates. Said Mauch of Irving being one of the best rookies in the league, “Those who know, know.”|2024-12-08 00:01:00|370|13|9|Bucky Irving|Offensive line praises Irving's impact & talent.|2|Comments are mixed with concerns about player usage and injuries overshadowing positive aspects.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""BucBoi25"", ""post"": ""Irving is definitely special at running the ball.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/gameday-tampa-bay-314/|Gameday Tampa Bay|Game 13 Raiders (2-10) at Bucs (6-6) Kickoff: 1 p.m. TV: CBS (WTSP-TV Channel 10, locally) with Spero Dedes, Adam Archuleta and Aditi Kinkhabwala.  Streaming: NFL+, Paramount+ (Geographic restrictions apply; subscription may be required). Radio: Buccaneers Radio Network WXTB-FM 97.9 in the Tampa-St. Petersburg region (Transmisiones de radio en español en WTMP-FM 96.1 y WMGG-AM 1470 en Tampa). Additional stations throughout Florida on the Buccaneers Radio Network can be found here. The game also will be broadcast on SiriusXM Channel 230 (Buccaneers Radio Network feed). Weather: A chilly start to a nice day, per AccuWeather.com.  Tailgaters might need a jacket as the temperatures will be in the low-50s. That will warm up quickly as kickoff looks to be 71, and temms will rise to 74 by game’s end — ll under sunny skies with zero precipitation expected and moderate winds. Odds: Per Hard Rock Bet, as of midnight, Bucs -6.5 (-325); over/under 46. Referees: Alan Eck and his gang are flat out homers, per Sharp Football Analysis. This season, home teams in games called by Eck and his posse are 13-3. Injuries: Raiders — Out: CB Nate Hobbs (ankle), RB Zamir White (quad). Doubtful: TE Justin Shorter (back). Questionable: RB Alexander Mattison (ankle), WR Jakobi Meyers (ankle). Bucs — Out: ILB K.J. Britt (ankle), S Mike Edwards (hamstring), CB Josh Hayes (hamstring), CB Troy Hill (foot/knee), ILB J.J. Russell (hamstring), OLB Joe Tryon-Shoyinka (ankle), OLB Markees Watts (knee). Questionable:  RB Bucky Irving (hip/back), WR Trey Palmer (hip),  DB Tykee Smith (knee). Outlook: Joe was outraged last week that the Bucs had to claw their way to a miracle win in overtime against the lousy Stinking Panthers. And Joe has the exact same standard and expectation for the Bucs today: a team fighting for its playoff life should stomp the stuffing out of garbage teams like the Raiders. Joe doesn’t give a damn if it’s the NFL. Good teams with their backs against the wall should destroy terrible teams. That’s Joe’s standard and expectation and many Bucs fans feel the same way. Toying with a trash opponent like a cat-and-mouse game is a recipe for disaster. Sadly, Joe believes this will be a close game. For example, Todd Bowles as an NFL head coach is 50-57-5 against the spread. That means over half the time, Bowles’ teams play closer games than expected. That’s not good, but typical for a defensive-minded head coach as their mantra is to “keep it close” defensively. Sadly, keeping it close means you keep the other team in the game. That’s setting the table more often than not for an upset. The Raiders are a sieve for points allowed (27.8 per game), which is 28th in the NFL. The Raiders are dead-last in the NFL in rushing with 78 yards a game. But the problem with the Bucs is their pass defense (258 yards a game), which is 30th in the league. And Raiders rookie tight end Brock Bowers is lighting people up. So if the Bucs don’t fix that — and why would anyone expect the Bucs to fix that this late in the season? — this game, Joe fears, will be another nail-biter. Good teams don’t let garbage teams fight to the end. The Bucs need to put their feet on the throats of the Raiders just like the Bucs did the Giants, not win by the skin of their teeth like the Bucs did with the Stinking Panthers. Fun facts: Last week against the Chiefs, two-bit Raiders QB Aidan O’Connell went bananas. He completed 23 of 35 attempts for a 65.7 percent completion percentage. O’Connell also threw for a career-high 340 yards (his first 300-yard passing game) two touchdowns and no picks. … RB Alexander Mattison has at least 60 scrimmage yards in three of his last four games. … TE Brock Bowers led the Raiders with 10 catches for career-high 140 yards and a touchdown last week against the Chiefs. It was his third game with at least 10 catches. … In his only game against the Bucs (while playing for the Patriots) in 2021, WR Jakobi Meyers had 8 catches for 70 yards. … DE Maxx Crosby had a sack and a tackle for loss last week. Crosby has 11 tackles for loss in seven road games this season. LB Robert “Mickey” Spillane had nine tackles against the Chiefs. It was his eighth game with at least nine tackles in 2024. … Bucs QB Baker Mayfield has Mayfield has the third-most touchdown passes in the NFL (25), second-most 300-yard passing games (four) and second-most three-touchdown passing games (five) and is the 18th-highest-paid quarterback. That, as the late, great “Big Dog,” Steve Duemig would say, is “value.” … RB Rachaad White has six touchdowns (four receiving and two running) in his past six games. RB Bucky Irving has been on fire. Last week against the Stinking Panthers, Irving had a career-high 185 scrimmage yards (152 on the ground and 33 through the air). The win over Carolina was also Irving’s first NFL game with over 100 yards rushing. Irving is looking for his third straight game with 150+ scrimmage yards and fourth straight game scoring a touchdown. … WR Mike Evans last week made his 101st career touchdown catch and the win over Carolina also marked his 37th-career game with 100 yards receiving. Evans has 14 receiving touchdowns in his last 13 home games. … LB Lavonte David has three tackles for loss in his three games playing the Raiders. … DT Calijah Kancey has five sacks and six tackles for loss in his last four games. In 21 career games, Kancey has 19 tackles for loss and 10 sacks. … CB Zyon McCollum had his 11th pass defended this season last week.
