https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/tom-moore-tristan-wirfs-the-5-play-rule/|Tom Moore, Tristan Wirfs & The 5-Play Rule|Yes, the Bucs have an 86-year-old assistant coach who works long hours and, three years ago, was spotted at the NFL Scouting Combine eating nachos and drinking a cold one at a hotel bar — close to 11 p.m.  He’s the sage of Buccaneers’ football, Tom Moore. All-Pro left tackle Tristan Wirfs brought up Moore during a recent chat with SportsGrid. Wirfs was reflecting on the Bucs’ many close losses last season and said the team is “right there.” A “one bounce” away theory feels right, Wirfs said, but he buys in deeper to the sage wisdom of Moore. Wirfs shared how Moore came to talk to him and his teammates at the University of Iowa years ago and lectured on how five key plays determine a game’s outcome, and every play counts because nobody knows what those five will be. For those counting, the Bucs had a 3-6 record in one-score games last season, including the playoff loss and a 1-2 record in overtime.|2025-02-18 14:51:00|165|17|7|Tom Moore|Wisdom of key plays in football outcomes.|7|Admirable respect for Tom Moore's coaching wisdom and dedication, uplifting sentiments flow throughout the comments.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Buccaneer Bonzai"", ""post"": ""Tom Moore is so cool."", ""post_time"": [""February"", ""18th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""3:07"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Jason"", ""post"": ""Pretty sure I remember Raheem Morris saying the same thing only he said 6 plays."", ""post_time"": [""February"", ""18th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""3:15"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""jameswillie"", ""post"": ""Tony Dungy got Tom Moore, Manning, Harrison and Wayne.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/josh-grizzard-details-ryan-fitzpatrick-guidance/|Josh Grizzard Details Ryan Fitzpatrick Guidance|There will be a little bit of Fitzmagic in the 2025 Buccaneers offense. No, Baker Mayfield is not growing out his beard. Rookie Bucs offensive coordinator Josh Grizzard was 26 years old when he joined the Miami Dolphins offensive staff as a quality control assistant back in 2017. Two years later, high-mileage NFL veteran QB Ryan Fitzpatrick landed on the Dolphins roster after two seasons with the Bucs. Grizzard told Joe that not only was Fitzpatrick a mentor to him, but Fitzpatrick’s teachings are still part of Grizzard’s approach today. Fitzpatrick recently blessed Grizzard’s promotion on social media. During his visit with The JoeBucsFan Show on WDAE radio, Grizzard described that as “pretty cool” and explained some of Fitzpatrick’s impact on his coaching. “He was huge for me,” Grizzard said of Fitzpatrick. “I learned so much from him. It might sound odd, the coach learning from the player [in Miami]. At that time, I’d only been in the NFL for a handful of years and he had played for so many organziations, and he just tried to tell me what he saw good and bad in coordinators and position coaches — and trying to eliminate things that are losing. He was just a wealth of knowledge and that was on the personnel side of it, and just on the field a competitor, love him to death.” Grizzard went on to say Fitzpatrick gave him a lot of feedback about planning for different scenarios, good and bad messaging, good and bad practice schemes and more. “[Fitzpatrick] had just seen so much that it was invaluable [guidance] and I still lean on some of those things today,” Grizzard said.|2025-02-18 11:18:00|277|18|8|Ryan Fitzpatrick|Grizzard learns valuable coaching lessons from Fitzmagic.|5|Mixed sentiments with some positive and negative comments about Fitz and Grizzard.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""HC Grover"", ""post"": ""Fitz is a real character."", ""post_time"": [""February"", ""18th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""11:36"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Aqualung"", ""post"": ""That was a hilarious bit when he wore DJax\u2019s swag for the presser.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/the-war-on-ben-bredeson/|The War On Ben Bredeson|Joe sometimes doesn’t understand where the disconnect began or how it evolved but we’ve now boarded the crazy train — with apologies to Ozzy Osbourne. What Joe expects and sees from offensive line play is truly a different prism from what others expect and see. Millions Of People Living As Foes. Joe is not sitting here trying to make the case that Bucs free agent guard Ben Bredeson is the next John Hannah (look him up). He’s not. But the guy certainly is not Garrett “Whoops!” Gilkey. Someone will have to point out to Joe how Bredeson was a “major liability” unless someone has a fully different definition of “liability.” Some media sells it and you live the role. The Bucs had the third-best offense last season with the fourth-best run game. How exactly can a team pull this off with a “liability” at left guard? A team doesn’t. But don’t tell that to Walter Cherepinsky, the man behind WalterFootball.com. To read his take on where the Bucs need to upgrade, you would think Cherepinsky was typing about Oniel Cousins. Guard: Ben Bredeson was a major liability on Tampa Bay’s offensive front, but his contract is set to expire anyway. This is driving Joe insane. Again, where is the evidence that Bredeson was so rotten? Joe read a stats outfit recently rank the Bucs as having the second-best pass-blocking unit in the league. You don’t do that with a turnstile at left guard. It seems Bredeson is living with something that just isn’t fair. Besides, Bredeson was playing next to a rookie center. If he was that awful, then Graham Barton would have been exposed as well. There are positions on the Bucs and starters who drag the team down. Bredeson is not one of them.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/bucs-need-a-playmaker-on-defense/|Bucs Need A “Playmaker” On Defense|It seems Mike Golic, Jr. is reading from the Football Book of Todd Bowles. The former Notre Dame offensive lineman and former BSPN NFL analyst almost seems to be trying to get a job with the Bucs because he pretty much parroted Bowles while explaining what is wrong with the Bucs. Specifically, Golic noted what’s wrong with the pass defense, as he told Mina Kimes of BSPN on her podcast. “They need a playmaker on that side of the ball,” Golic said. “What are they [at], six interceptions this season? Just like, I get that there is some variability and [personnel] turnover, but like, you got to have dudes in position to make plays.” Joe doesn’t fully disagree but Joe believes forcing turnovers is often as much luck as skill. A defense has to hope an offense makes a mistake. Regular readers know what Joe thinks of the word “hope.” And what’s the best way to make a good quarterback commit a mistake? You guessed it: The fear the quarterback has of getting his ribs caved in. But playmakers? Golic is not wrong there. Outside of Bucs defensive tackles and Lavonte David (who may or may not play this fall), and Antoine Winfield when healthy, what playmakers do the Bucs have on defense? “So I’m with you, defense, back end or pass rush, they go so hand in hand, would absolutely be the medicine,” Golic told Kimes. Because [Joe] Tryon-Shoyinka was never what they had hoped.” Joe doesn’t believe that good quarterbacks make mistakes when they have seven seconds to throw without an edge rusher within eyesight. Give a good quarterback time to throw and he will pick apart a good secondary. Joe will give a playmaker hat tip to Tykee Smith, the rookie who had a quiet finish to the season. He finished with a team-leading three forced fumbles (plus another stolen from him by officials) and 2 interceptions in 13 games.|2025-02-18 07:00:00|323|37|5|Bucs|Defense needs playmakers in pass defense for success.|4|Mixed opinions on defense, with some calling for pass rush improvement and others defending players.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Lt.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/espn-bucs-wont-use-a-franchise-tag-again-on-chris-godwin/|ESPN: Bucs Won’t Use A Franchise Tag (Again) On Chris Godwin|The reason why most people — including Joe — have never mentioned Chris Godwin getting franchise tagged is that if Bucs AC/DC-loving general manager Jason Licht tagged Godwin for the third time, Team Glazer might start wondering who spiked Licht’s coffee. If a player is tagged by a team three times, per the NFL’s bargaining agreement with the NFLPA, that player would have to be paid 144 percent of his previous season’s salary. Thus, Godwin’s 2025 salary under a third tag would be in the $29 million ballpark. The Bucs have already tagged Godwin twice. But, unless told otherwise, Licht just might have a lapse of reason. Per Jenna Laine of ESPN, her Bucs sources told her as much as the Bucs want Godwin back, paying him $29 million is unthinkable. So no, the Bucs won’t tag Godwin as tag season gets underway today. … They used the tag as a placeholder the last time Godwin was a free agent (in 2022), and they used it on him in 2021, so this would be his third time being tagged — therefore it would have to be a 144% raise, and I’m told there is “no chance” of that happening. They’ll do what it takes to re-sign him as a free agent. The Bucs are unlikely to tag anyone. At the price and salary cap hit to tag a player, he pretty much has to be one of the top players at his position. No pending Bucs free agent is close to that, with the exception of Godwin. If fact, no team in the NFL is expected to use the tag this season. The tag window is open from today through March 4. The free agency dinner bell rings the following week.|2025-02-18 03:45:00|291|40|2|Chris Godwin|Bucs unlikely to use franchise tag on Godwin again.|2|Mixed sentiments about Godwin's future due to injury concerns and contract negotiations.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Buc king"", ""post"": ""I love Godwin but will he make it through a season healthy?

He was already a legend at Iowa when he stepped in as a rookie for the Bucs in 2020 and dominated at right tackle blocking for Tom Brady. While appearing with Ari Meirov of The33rdTeam recently, Wirfs explained one of the biggest things he had to get used to in the NFL was, unlike at Iowa, you could lose two or more games and your season isn’t remotely over. “It was pretty insane, like, looking back on it now, like, at the time, I didn’t really know how crazy it was,” Wirfs said of his rookie season. “I mean, we lost, we lost like, three or four in a row there for a while or a little stretch? “And I was like, in college, you know, coming from college, you lose two — for us at Iowa, it was like, you lose two and we’re out of the big race for the Big 10 championship. “So, like, we lost two that year. And I was like, ‘We can’t — we’re done.’ And then we, you know, [coaches] come in, they’re like, ‘We can still do.’ We lost three. They said the same thing. ‘We can still do we want to do.’ We lost four. I was like, ‘This has to be it.’ But they said, ‘We still do we want to do.'” To be fair to Wirfs, the Bucs that season never lost more than two games in a row. In November 2020, the Bucs did lose three out of four games. And the Bucs didn’t lose their fourth game until late November. (In a subsequent sitdown on “The Pivot” podcast, Wirfs recounted the same story only he identified then-Bucs coach Bucco Bruce Arians as the coach who repeatedly reminded the team, “We can still do what we want to do.”) After the Bucs’ Week 13 bye, they never lost another game, racking up eight straight victories to win the Super Bowl. “It’s like looking back on it now, it was insane,” Wirfs said. “Three road games against three former MVPs [in the playoffs], you know, then to have a home Super Bowl? It’s unbelievable like it’s storybook stuff. “So looking back on it, it’s just incredible. But um, yeah, that was a wild year.” Joe thought it was cool that of all the things Wirfs learned as a rookie, he mentioned losing more than two games is no reason to panic or throw in the towel and the NFL is a sprint and not a marathon. Even though the Bucs finished with a sprint and a Vince Lombardi Trophy.|2025-02-18 00:00:00|444|6|7|Tristan Wirfs|Rookie lessons in NFL resilience and Super Bowl triumph.|5|Mixed sentiments about coaching and team performance, ranging from critical to positive.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Aqualung"", ""post"": ""Back when the Bucs had a full time winning head coach and a full time defensive coordinator reporting to him, things were better.
