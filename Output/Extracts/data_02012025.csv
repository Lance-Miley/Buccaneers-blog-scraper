https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/mike-alstott-devoted-baker-mayfield-fan/|Mike Alstott, Devoted Baker Mayfield Fan|Arguably the greatest lunch-pail warrior in the history of Bucs offenses, retired fullback Mike Alstott (1996-2006), has found a current Bucs player he absolutely adores. And it’s not Bucky Irving.  Alstott, the “A-Train,” joined WDAE radio last night and talked about the state of the Bucs. He was a big fan of the 2024 season, and it’s a safe bet he’s not in the fire Todd Bowles camp. “I loved it. I thought they were exciting, played with a lot of passion, a lot of heart,” Alstott said. “I think that goes a long way for future-building. I really beleive they have their nucleus in place. “I’m a big fan of Baker. … … Baker is just a gamer. He’s just a true gamer and oh, I love the guy. He’ll give up his body for the team and the first down and what not.” Alstott, 51, went on to praise team unity and focus, citing the Bucs fighting through injuries for 10 wins. “Everybody stepped up and I love that type of mentality. That reminds of when I was playing with [Tony] Dungy, ‘Next man up,'” Alstott said. “And it was like, ‘Hey, get’er done. It doesn’t matter who’s in.'” Interesting to Joe was Alstott being asked for his take on Irving, the rookie running back sensation. Alstott sort of punted. While he said Irving was strong, Alstott was more focused on the group effort to pound the rock. “It was great seeing a team running the football. You know what I mean?” Alstott said. “In today’s age of NFL, you just don’t see that too often, and sticking with the run.” Alstott noted the Bucs breaking runs late in games was a byproduct of their run commitment. Joe loved the Bucs’ success running, too, but remember that the Bucs ranked 10th this season in pass attempts and 10th in run attempts — and averaged 29.5 points per game. They were lethal — and committed — in all aspects of offense.|2025-02-01 16:56:00|332|34|8|Mike Alstott|Former fullback praises Bucs offense|7|Mixed sentiments with praise for certain players/coaches and criticism towards others, especially regarding defense.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""JimBobBuc"", ""post"": ""The OL under Carberry was vastly improved and they adjusted the blocking scheme to what type was working\u2026.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/mike-evans-unsure-if-hell-be-retired-in-2028-yes-2028/|Mike Evans Unsure If He’ll Be Retired In 2028. Yes, 2028.|Great news coming out of Disney World today.  Joe’s buddy Rock Riley was at Pro Bowl practice and asked Mike Evans about playing flag football in the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles. Evans expressed an Olympics interest last year. But today he said he’s unsure if it will fit his football schedule. Evans told Riley he might still be playing real NFL football. “This is good practice for me in the Olympics,” Evans said of the Pro Bowl flag football game. “Most likely I’ll be retired by 2028. How many years is that, three years? I don’t know. But if I am retired, I’ll definitely like to play in the Olympics.” This is Exhibit A why Joe scoffed when there was chatter from One Buc Palace and among media that the Bucs made Evans a “Buc For Life” with a new two-year contract before this season. The way Evans was talking today, he thinks he’ll play at least three more seasons 2025, 2026 and 2027 — but he’s only under contract for 2025. Sage Ira Kaufman has lobbied on his iconic podcast for the Bucs to extend Evans’ contract this offseason for one more year. Kaufman says Evans, who turns 32 in August, deserves the peace of mind and respect. Joe concurs. Remember, back in 2023, when Evans entered the final year of his then-contract without a new deal, he was not happy. He even went public with thoughts of a holdout.|2025-02-01 14:35:00|242|27|7|Mike Evans|Evans considers playing flag football in 2028 Olympics|6|Mixed sentiment on Mike Evans' future career longevity and legacy with some optimism.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Durango 95"", ""post"": ""Dude is such a great player.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/baker-mayfield-i-know-josh-grizzard-will-succeed/|Baker Mayfield: “I Know” Josh Grizzard Will Succeed|The man who stands to gain (or lose) most with the change from Liam Coen to Josh Grizzard as the man in charge of the Bucs offense is Baker Mayfield. And Mayfield, at Pro Bowl practices in Orlando today, summed up to local sports media icon Rock Riley a message of sorts to Bucs fans all over the globe. We got this. Of course, Mayfield deep down very likely doesn’t want yet another offensive coordinator. Grizzard will be Mayfield’s eighth  when the Bucs gather in April for OTAs followed by underwear football. But Mayfield pointed out to Rock he knows “Griz” well from working with him so much. Mayfield is fully confident that despite calling plays for the first time of his career, Grizzard will handle the responsibility. “It’s like Dave [Canales],” Mayfield said. “He hadn’t called plays until” he came to the Bucs. “How involved ‘Griz’ was — we were in every meeting together. So, how involved he was in the game plan, I know that he’s going to be a good playcaller.” Very assuring and comforting words from the Bucs’ franchise quarterback. Now here is the conundrum for Bucs fans: Do you want Grizzard to succeed? Because if he does, history will likely repeat itself and the Bucs this time in 2026 will be welcoming a new offensive coordinator again as Grizzard will be an NFL head coach elsewhere.|2025-02-01 13:17:00|231|31|6|Baker Mayfield|Mayfield confident Grizzard|5|Mixed sentiments about OC success and impact on team performance.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Tbbucs3"", ""post"": ""\u201cNow here is the conundrum for Bucs fans: Do you want Grizzard to succeed?\u201d"", ""post_time"": [""February"", ""1st,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""1:20"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""FilthyAnimal"", ""post"": ""I feel good about this.

Local sports media icon Rock Riley is killing it at the Pro Bowl practices in Orlando today. He was able to corner Bucs future Hall of Fame wide receiver Mike Evans. Evans said he really didn’t care who the Bucs hired as offensive coordinator to fill the void left by Liam Coen. Why didn’t he care? “It’s my job to get open and make plays for our team,” Evans told Rock. Evans also told Rock he had no input with the Bucs on who should replace Liam Coen. When Rock asked Evans what he thought of new offensive coordinator Josh Grizzard, Evans then broke out into a smile and said, “Me and Josh, we’re cool. We’re cool. So, I hope I get the ball a lot this year. … I think it’s a good hire.” Getting Evans the ball would be a very smart move. At least Joe thinks so.

Or begging for a job. That’s the reality of being Baker Mayfield’s offensive coordinator. As many have pointed out recently, Mayfield is now on his eighth different offensive coordinator (Grizzard) as he prepares for his eighth year in the NFL. One of those guys is unemployed and working national sports radio. One is working for Bill Belichick in North Carolina. Two are considered among the better offensive minds in football. His last two have become head coaches. Today, local sports media icon Rock Riley caught up with Hall of Fame quarterback Peyton Manning at the Pro Bowl practices in Orlando. There, Manning was asked about Mayfield. In short, Manning had both sympathy and respect for Mayfield. He noted that it’s not easy having a different guy in your ear with a different offense each season. But Mayfield has persevered. Props to Mayfield for that, Manning said. Manning also admitted it’s been fun to watch Mayfield play quarterback the past two seasons leading the Bucs to the playoffs each year. You can see the full clip below.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/liam-coen-on-josh-grizzard/|Liam Coen On Josh Grizzard|Some readers don’t appreciate that Joe is on the level with fans. Now Joe has no way of knowing if, back in December, then-Bucs offensive coordinator Liam Coen was being a good colleague and not wanting to be a glory hog at his own news conference. And, as a result, he wanted to spread good cheer right before Christmas. Or perhaps Coen was truly sincere. But Joe wanted to offer up Coen’s words then on his eventual successor, new Bucs offensive coordinator Josh Grizzard. The Bucs had the NFL’s best third-down offense this season. The Bucs converted 51 percent of their third downs! Coen told the local pen and mic club a week before Christmas that success was because Grizzard because is in his sphere of influence. Grizzard, per Coen, would break down tape of opponents’ and craft plays that could work on third downs and exploit defensive weaknesses or tendencies. He then would hand his work over to Coen. “I think, first of all, shoutout to Josh [Grizzard] and really the staff in general have done a phenomenal job throughout the whole year. The guys in charge of those areas – Thad Lewis is in charge of the red zone, ‘B-Mac’ (Brian McClendon) is in charge of two-minute, and ‘Grizz’ (Grizzard) happens to be in charge of third downs. “Their ideas, plays, and thoughts and schemes is what does come to life as what you see on Sunday. Definitely, not all of those plays come right from me – we have a full staff.” So if Coen was sincere, this explains why the Bucs wanted so badly to keep the band together. Not only because the Bucs had great success with that music, but Joe is going to take a wild stab and suggest responsibilities won’t change much, except for Grizzard’s. The same guys will be in charge of the same downs, though the Bucs may bring someone in to help Grizzard on third downs. So even though losing an coordinator causes disruption, it seems the Bucs are trying, with Grizzard, to mitigate it. And keep Baker Mayfield happy in the process.|2025-02-01 09:00:00|353|35|7|Liam Coen|Coen praises Josh Grizzard's success in coaching the Bucs offense.|3|Mixed sentiment with some frustration and uncertainty about Coen leaving and potential impact on the team.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""adam from ny"", ""post"": ""joe can you please make liam go away\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.asking for a friend"", ""post_time"": [""February"", ""1st,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""9:13"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Pahpahmike"", ""post"": ""Joe, that\u2019s the question I was asking in the last article.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/what-to-expect-from-josh-grizzard/|What To Expect From Josh Grizzard|So the Bucs have their man, Josh Grizzard to run the offense. What can we expect? A lot of fans wanted “continuity.” It may not be that simple. Fans know the NFL is a copycat league. Defenses have all offseason to study a team’s offense, what it did well, and how to stop it. So in reality, “continuity” is sort of a bad thing. The league catches up too quickly. Bucs coach Todd Bowles has often said he changes up things regularly on defense for that very purpose (maybe he doesn’t do enough?). So a few weeks into the season, Grizzard’s offense should be pretty well understood. Could the Bucs offense be just as lethal? Perhaps, but Joe doesn’t think those expectations are fair to Grizzard. Liam Coen did one of the best coaching jobs Joe has seen in a while. Think about it: With a rookie center, a rookie No. 3 receiver (for the most part) and a rookie running back, Coen took a running attack that for two straight years was the worst in the NFL and turned it into the No. 4 running attack. That is just absurd. Then, with an offense largely without Chris Godwin and three games without a Hall of Fame receiver Mike Evans, the Bucs were third overall in passing (250 yards a game). That’s just nuts. Grizzard could to improve on that, but those expectations are unfair for a guy calling offensive plays and running an offense for the very first time in his career. At least Coen had experience doing this in the SEC. Joe does think it is reasonable to expect Grizzard’s offense to be top-10. Those rookies should improve — if only because they have a full season of NFL football under their belts. Grizzard did spend two years as a quality control guy with Mike McDaniel. And McDaniel, like his mentor Kyle Shanahan, knows how to craft a run game. But really, how much of that seeps down to a quality control coach, which is what Grizzard was with McDaniel? Joe sure hopes whatever Grizzard absorbed from Coen and McDaniel is flushed out on Sundays.|2025-02-01 08:00:00|357|35|5|Josh Grizzard|Uncertain expectations for Josh Grizzard's offense in the Bucs.|8|Overall positive but with some concerns and skepticism expressed.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Lt.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/jalen-mcmillan-sure-seems-happy-about-the-josh-grizzard-promotion/|Jalen McMillan Sure Seems Happy About The Josh Grizzard Promotion|So the Bucs have a new offensive coordinator, you may have heard. To fill the void left by the departure of Liam Coen, who scurried off to Jacksonville, the Bucs promoted passing game coordinator Josh Grizzard to replace him. At least two Bucs rookies seem pretty happy with the move. Receiver Jalen McMillan took to his Instagram Stories account and had a screenshot of the Bucs’ Instagram post announcing the promotion of Gizzard yesterday. McMillan responded with an “AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH” with the popular Tom Brady cry written in an acronym, “LFG.” So McMillen is happy. Also in the Bucs’ Instagram post, tight end Devin Culp liked it. So that makes two Bucs rookies who are on board with this move. Tristan Wirfs also liked the Instagram post. But that’s it. Joe didn’t spend an hour looking up all Bucs players’ social media accounts. And they are spread out all across the Western Hemisphere right now so Joe is confident many are too busy living on a Friday evening and not glued to their phones. But it is cool that two rookie skill position players on offense were stoked enough with the Grizzard news to celebrate on Instagram. |2025-02-01 00:00:00|196|36|8|Jalen McMillan|Bucs promote Josh Grizzard|3|Mix of optimism and skepticism towards team changes and personnel decisions.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""ATLBucSolar"", ""post"": ""Great.
