Old Stinking Panthers nemesis Brian Burns along with Azeez Ojulari have a dozen sacks combined. That feels like four years’ worth of sacks from the Bucs’ edge.And in the middle is a guy, Dexter Lawrence, who Coen has so much respect for, he referred to Lawrence as “97” today, saying Lawrence is one of the better defensive players in the league“We have to be aware of him on every play,” Coen said. “We have got to have a plan for 97.”What Coen also sees from the Giants defense ois players that screw with quarterbacks.“They got multiple pass rushers that can affect the quarterback,” Coen said. “They have affected the quarterback, everyone that they have basically played, they’ve affected.“What they’ve been able to do and affect offenses has been impressive.”The Giants rank second in the NFL in sacks with 36. That likely also explains why the Giants have held opponents to the sixth-worst conversion percentage on third downs at 34.15 percent.Compounding the Giants’ ferocious pass rush is that Bucs left tackle Tristan Wirfs might not play. He had a sprained MCL (knee) against the 49ers. Yesterday, Todd Bowles said Wirfs’ availability would be “close” and that a decision will likely be made Sunday morning.Ira Kaufman Demands The Floor To Clarify His Stance On Jason Licht, Talks Post-Bye Miss, Mike Evans Realities, Bucs-Giants Predictions, And More", "post_time": "2024-11-21T21:45:07+00:00", "word_count": 306, "number_of_comments": 19, "article_sentiment_score": "9", "article_subject": "Giants Defense", "article_summary": "Giants defense strong", "responses": {"commenter0": {"username": "AJ Turn up", "post": "At the end of the day the Bucs have 3 RBs they can utilize to slow this pass rush down, Mike Evans coming back means Giants will most likely double him.

He blew out a hamstring in the loss to the Crows a month ago.Coen said the biggest issue for him if Evans plays is to know what Evans can or cannot do.“We really don’t know what his true availability will be,” Coen said. “It’s just going to be hard to tell with Mike right now. If he can go how much can he go? I don’t know.”Still, a limited Evans is better than the guys who played in his absence. Coen admitted he can’t be dumb with how he uses Evans.“How much do you want to send him all the way down the field on a long route,” Coen asked. “Because we’re trying to be smart. We’re trying to keep him going now if we get him back.”With a gimpy hamstring, sending Evans on a go-route might just see him pop his hamstring again. Then what? He’s out until Christmas?Joe got the sense from Coen that Evans will only be a short-field target and he’ll use Evans a lot in motion to seduce the Giants defense in a way that gives others an opportunity for an explosive play.Of course, watch how Evans ends up being sent deep and he scores three touchdowns.Ira Kaufman Demands The Floor To Clarify His Stance On Jason Licht, Talks Post-Bye Miss, Mike Evans Realities, Bucs-Giants Predictions, And More", "post_time": "2024-11-21T21:05:46+00:00", "word_count": 285, "number_of_comments": 11, "article_sentiment_score": "5", "article_subject": "Mike Evans", "article_summary": "Uncertainty surrounds Evans' availability due to hamstring injury.", "responses": {"commenter0": {"username": "A Bucs Fan", "post": "The Bucs should have protected him from himself and put him on IR before the Ravens game.

It didn’t happen in Tampa. However, Bowles had the Bucs in pads today.Because of injuries and short weeks, it’s been a while since the Bucs had a padded practice. All-World left tackle Tristan Wirfs said he was all for it.“I think it’s been a great week. Guys moving around. In pads today, so get a little pop, you know, coming off the bye.

Joe could see the Bucs forcing the ball to Evans in an effort to pad his stats. That could greatly backfire.As Bucs coach Todd Bowles said yesterday, the Bucs are first and foremost trying to win.“No, I don’t think it’s a concern,” Bowles said of Evans’ chase for 1,000 receiving yards. “We’re trying to win the ballgame.“Mike is a big part of the offense, so he’s going to be in the ballgame when he comes back. We’ll go from there – see how they’re playing us and take it from there.”In short, Bowles doesn’t seem on board with forcing passes to Evans. And he shouldn’t be.Bowles has to worry about the entire team. His team. The playoffs are not out of the question. Yet.

So two elements of Bucs history have Joe spooked about Sunday’s game against as the Bucs buckle their chinstraps for the final seven games of the regular season.The first element is recent history. The Bucs are on a four-game losing streak. What makes that worse is that in the last two games, the Bucs defense collapsed in the final moments as the Chiefs and 49ers each won on their final drive.Double-ouch!The second element is the history of Todd Bowles. In his six seasons as a head coach (four with the Jets ), Bowles is 1-5 in the first game after a bye, including four straight losses.Despite the doom and gloom and folks lined up at the Sunshine Skyway Bridge, Bowles yesterday preached calm and patience. He believes the Bucs are really close to launching into a winning streak.“It’s just everybody needing to do their job,” Bowles said. “If we take care of us and everybody has their responsibility, not trying to do too much, we’ll be fine.“[We’re] focusing on fundamentals and technique and that’s at every level of the defense – offensively, as well. We went over the Giants film, we went over our film. We need to take care of us. We need to get back to playing how we want to play. If we can do that, we’ll be okay.”Thankfully, Bowles said one of those fundamentals the team is focusing on is tackling.Joe hopes Bowles also simplifies things. Bowles often says he changes up his defense each year as not to have other teams figure him out.What drives Joe crazy is that Bowles recently was griping about a decreased pass rush from his interior defensive line. Yet on the 49ers’ first possession in the Bucs’ last game, on separate plays, Joe saw both Vita Vea and Calijah Kancey drop back into coverage.Knock it off!Look, Joe likes that Bowles will try something exotic to cross up an opponent. That’s smart and players tend to get excited about doing something different. But Joe would love to see a predraft report on Vea and/or Kancey that detailed how strong they were in pass coverage.Joe maintains such a report never existed.Stunts like that are for teams that have winning records, not for teams to get all cute when they otherwise cannot accomplish basic tasks and instead, are fighting for their playoff lives.Let’s start with that fundamental, shall we?

But Joe understands what Bowles is trying to say.Doesn’t mean Joe agrees with it, but Joe understands what Bowles and offensive coordinator Liam Coen are trying to do.Joe doesn’t think anyone who even casually has watched the Bucs the past two or three years can say with a straight face that Rachaad White is a better running back than Bucky Irving.When it comes to pass blocking and catching the ball, White is better. In fact, Joe thinks there aren’t too many backs who are as dangerous catching passes out of the backfield as White.Yesterday, Bowles was asked if Irving has earned more carries. Currently, Irving averages just under 10 carries a game.Bowles didn’t deny Irving has proved worthy of a bigger load. However, Bowles added Irving is still currently a situational player.“He probably has earned more touches, but there are certain situations that other guys have certain responsibilities that they have to play, too,” Bowles said.And this is where White comes into play. He can pass block better and catch the ball better.But as a running back, Irving, Joe believes, should be the Bucs’ No. 1.“It’s going to be by committee,” Bowles said of who gets on the field. “It’s going to be who’s hot during the week.”Now Joe didn’t like that quote.Who gives a flying s(p)it how a guy does in non-padded practices on a Wednesday? If a guy is tearing up a defense on Sunday, keep him on the field and feed him. This really isn’t rocket science.“We know Bucky can do a lot of great things, we know Rachaad [White] can do things, as well as Sean [Tucker],” Bowles explained. Irving will “continue to get his touches. Sometimes it may be more, sometimes it may not be. Depending on the situation that we’re in from a football standpoint, we’ve got to play it how we play it and see it – but he’s definitely earned more touches.”Joe thinks the crux here is the Bucs’ final drive against the 49ers. A touchdown would give the Bucs the lead. The Bucs had to kick a field goal to instead.And even a dude walking around with a white cane could see what was going to happen at that point: The Bucs’ soft defense once again bent over and allowed the 49ers to march down the field like it was an underwear football practice and kick the game-winning field goal.Thank you sir, may I have another?On the Bucs’ final drive, White was on the field. OK, Joe doesn’t have a problem with that if you were going to use him as a blocker (remember, Tristan Wirfs wasn’t in the game as he injured his knee). Or if the Bucs were going to throw the ball, one could argue White was the team’s best receiver available.But what did Coen do? He called for two runs between the tackles in the red zone, the very type of runs White is horrible at. The results were too predictable.If the Bucs planned to run, it was indefensible not to give the best running back the ball.Not using Irving there might have been the first egregious error Joe has seen Coen make.Joe just hopes come the middle of January we don’t look back at that decision possibly costing the Bucs a playoff berth like Hey Jude did in 2016 or a zebra did in 2010.", "post_time": "2024-11-21T08:45:42+00:00", "word_count": 574, "number_of_comments": 34, "article_sentiment_score": "3", "article_subject": "Todd Bowles", "article_summary": "Debate on running back roles and playcalling decisions.", "responses": {"commenter0": {"username": "Kenton Smith", "post": "Joe you have said that it’ll take til Thanksgiving for our OLine to be hitting on all cylinders.

He had two stints each with the Rams (2018-20, 2022) and the University of Kentucky (2021, 2023) before replacing Panthers head coach Dave Canales as Tampa Bay’s OC this past offseason. The Buccaneers’ offense has improved statistically, ranking fifth in scoring (27.9 points per game) despite Tampa’s ongoing four-game losing streak amidst injuries to its top receivers. Coen has the demeanor and personality for a head job. He may get a look.Joe believes two things will get owners’ attention with Coen. The first, of course, is quarterback.Always remember and never forget, the NFL is a quarterback league. You can holler “defense” and “team” all you want, but no quarterback, no shot. It’s that simple.And while Coen’s predecessor and current Stinking Panthers coach Dave Canales did a fine job with Baker Mayfield, Coen has taken Mayfield to even higher levels through 10 games.Do strong work with quarterbacks and you can damn near pick your head coaching job.The other is that in the three games following the injuries to Mike Evans and Chris Godwin, the Bucs offense barely missed a beat. Only in the last game against the 49ers did it feel like the Bucs were missing Evans and Godwin.Coen found a way to bridge the gap until Evans got back, and Bucs coach Todd Bowles said yesterday that Evans is “trending” to play Sunday at the Giants.That’s a good coach very valuable to NFL owners.

They’ve been key components to building the Bucs into a team that won three consecutive division titles after winning a Super Bowl. That’s an uncommon feat in NFL history.And that does not factor in Spytek and Greenberg helping craft the roster that was good enough for Tom Brady to select for his seventh Super Bowl.(No, Joe doesn’t blame the Bucs’ front office for Brady wanting to leave and play for the Dolphins.)However, it seems to be an annual tradition for NFL owners to show little to no interest in plucking gems from Licht’s staff.That could change soon. The Jets fired their general manager, after firing their head coach, and Greenberg’s name has been circulating.New York’s blowtorch sports radio station WFAN has its primetime afternoon/evening show hosted by Evan Roberts and Tiki Barber, and Barber was lobbying for Greenberg this week.The former star Giants running back called Greenberg a friend and noted “he’d be a great choice.”Greenberg grew up a Jets fan in New York, Roberts noted, and said he believes that is an important factor.Of course, Joe thinks it’s ludicrous to claim it’s important for a potential GM to have been a fan of a particular team as a kid. But Joe does believe Greenberg is a viable candidate.Greenberg isn’t the prototype GM because he didn’t play football at a high level, but that’s not a prerequisite to success. Heck, longtime Panthers GM Marty Hurney, now a front office advisor to the Commanders, was a sportswriter for 10 years before jumping into working for a team. (Does that mean Ira Kaufman could replace Greenberg in Tampa?)Regardless, Joe is pleased to see the Bucs’ front office getting a shred of respect very early in the hiring cycle for the 2025 season.It certainly would help the cause of Greenberg, Spytek and others on Licht’s staff if Todd Bowles can get his team to snap out of its funk and beat up on the five poor teams — Carolina twice — remaining on the Bucs’ schedule.", "post_time": "2024-11-21T00:43:27+00:00", "word_count": 380, "number_of_comments": 13, "article_sentiment_score": "7", "article_subject": "Mike Greenberg", "article_summary": "Greenberg mentioned as potential Jets GM from successful Bucs staff.", "responses": {"commenter0": {"username": "Dewey Selmon", "post": "Greenberg has helped this franchise with the ability to manipulate the salary cap to be able to keep players and sign free agents.
