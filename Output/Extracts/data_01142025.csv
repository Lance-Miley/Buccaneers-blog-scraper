https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/jason-licht-lauds-remarkable-todd-bowles-record/|Jason Licht Lauds “Remarkable” Todd Bowles Record|Joe knows there are still media types and fans in disbelief that Todd Bowles will be the 2025 Buccaneers head coach. Joe sort of understands. Heck, Joe was in disbelief when the Bucs decided to bring Doug Martin back for the 2017 season.  But that was a very different situation. Martin had a drug problem and was suspended to start the 2017 season after averaging 2.9 yards per carry in 2016. Bowles has clean urine, has built an impressive team culture and has won three consecutive division titles. Sports columnist John Romano of TampaBay.com — the internet arm of Tampa Bay’s pay-per-view, twice-weekly community newspaper — popped a piece today addressing fans wanting Bowles launched now. Romano talked to Buccaneers Ring of Honor general manager Jason Licht, who gave another endorsement of Bowles’ work. They won 10 games, and another division title. “It’s just kind of the cycle that we’re in with this team,” general manager Jason Licht said a few days before the Commanders game. “Two years ago when we had the — I don’t want to say rebuild — but we knew it was going to take some time to fill every spot on the defense. Is there some spots that we could add to? Of course. But it takes time. “And what he has done with what we have, I think, has been remarkable.” Joe’s not going to run through a laundry list of Bowles achievements and underachievements. Did the Bucs lose a very winnable playoff game at home on Sunday? Damn right. But the reality is Bowles has the team going in a good direction with a franchise quarterback who respects him, and he’s shown he’s open to making adjustments. Plus, the Bucs have been operating at a salary cap deficit that has nothing to do with Bowles and everything to do with glorious overspending during the Tom Brady era. Fans have various stances on Bowles, and Joe thinks that’s healthy. Regardless, the head coach is not going anywhere for the 2025 season, despite wild theories being floated across town.|2025-01-14 15:38:00|344|164|7|Todd Bowles|Praise for Todd Bowles amidst fan skepticism and playoff loss.|4|Mixed sentiment about coach and team performance, some dissatisfaction with defensive strategy and coaching.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Durango 95"", ""post"": ""Hate to be the one to break it to you big guy.

I was undaunted because I had seen what Baker had done with a franchise that went 1-31 in the two seasons before his arrival.(Speaking of coaches, the neo-Browns brought Hue Jackson back for another year.) I was thus torn between hope because of Baker and resignation because a rebuilding team is expected to be a losing team, of which I had had much experience. I did not expect a rebuilding team to win two division titles in two years, including a ten-win season. Some positive thoughts from my experience, especially related to coaching. First, How good are the players on paper? Before each season, critics, commentators, and gamblers project the number of wins to be expected based on an analysis of a team\u2019s roster. The first year I believe the consensus for the Bucs was about five-six games; this past season, six-seven games. Both years they performed well above the projections based on their talents. Second, they have been playing many young players, especially rookies, in key roles; and they have been victorious over or competitive with excellent teams. The two playoff losses were so close that many writers in these blogs claim that only one (an interception in Detroit) or two (a muddled handoff and a mistimed snap) plays kept the Bucs from winning. In the recent game the two misplays involved rookies playing in the tight fourth quarter of their first playoff game. Thus, I agree with those who see the team going in the right direction based on both improving records and ongoing addition of talented players. This is still a rebuild in progress. We should not be deceived because the team\u2019s record is much better than that of other rebuilding teams. I can\u2019t forget 1-31.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/did-the-bucs-just-fall-victim-to-the-new-tom-brady/|Did The Bucs Just Fall Victim To The New Tom Brady?|The Bucs may have just fallen victim to the newest fourth-quarter killer on the NFL’s landscape. Roger Staubach was the ultimate fourth-quarter comeback king of the 1970s. That guy was like a snake. Unless you had a four-touchdown lead on the Cowboys, that sonofagun would either win the game or have the Cowboys knocking on the door. There was no more of a clutch quarterback until Joe Montana came along and did just that to Staubach’s successor, when he and Dwight Clark teamed up on “The Catch” in 1981. To this day Joe swears Montana was throwing the ball away. Though Montana and Tom Brady never played on the same field, Brady eventually took the baton from Montana. As Joe saw first-hand with Brady playing for the Bucs, the man was dangerous in the fourth quarter. And while Pat Mahomes is no slouch with fourth-quarter comebacks, already in his rookie season Commandos quarterbck Jayden Daniels has shown he too has that fourth quarterback magic. And NFL observer Mike Tanier, typing on his Substack “Too Deep Zone,” believes the Bucs may just be the latest, and so far the biggest dragon Daniels has slain in crunch time. Daniels then did what he always does late in the fourth quarter: he led a game-winning drive. For once, it did not include any fourth-and-wow conversions, but he had already gotten those out of his system. So are the Bucs going to be part of the legend of Daniels some 10 or 20 years from now? Daniels now has five fourth-quarter comebacks for wins. Is famed JoeBucFan.com columnist and Hall of Fame selector Ira Kaufman going to wax poetic “in the room” about how the Bucs helped Daniels skyrocket to fame and fortune by helping Daniels launch his legend when Ira is 100-years old? If you have to lose, better to lose to an all-timer than to lose to Cooper Rush.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/philosophy-change-on-defensive-front/|Philosophy Change On Defensive Front|So head coach Todd Bowles and key players and coaches typically meet with TV broadcasters the day before each game. The idea is to give the broadcasters inside info so they sound smart and on point to the masses. Sometimes, a little bit of that intel trickles out on the game broadcast in the form of “Coach told us …” That happened Sunday night. Annoying NBC analyst Cris Collinsworth dropped this nugget after YaYa Diaby stuffed a 1st-and-goal run by Washington for no gain. “It was interesting as we were talking to Todd Bowles about changes; he said defenses change every 2 1/2 years, so he went from being big with the tackles to big with the edges,” Collinsworth said. “And it’s helped his defenses.” Joe will let fans chew on that over a plate of Hooters wings. Joe has heard Bowles talk a few times about needing to adapt/evolve his defense every two or three years. If not, he says, it’ll be figured out by offensive coordinators. Joe’s not sure where Bowles is in his cycle, but it’s sure appears to be time for a fresh tweak this offseason, and that’s most likely the plan.|2025-01-14 14:35:00|196|38|6|Philosophy Change On Defensive Front|Defensive philosophy evolving with insights from Todd Bowles for adaptation.|3|Mixed reactions regarding defensive changes, dissatisfaction with current coaching staff, calls for improvement.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""drdneastup"", ""post"": ""Does that mean he is going to stop dropping Diaby and other guys like Vea and Kancey back into pass coverage.

He’s a smart ex-player who actually watches most NFL games and does his homework.  The retired defensive end, who won Super Bowl rings with Belicheats and Eagles, has been on the Bucs’ bandwagon since before the season started. He was not in the loud crowd panting for Kirk Cousins and thinking the Bucs would win seven games. Yesterday, Long broke down the Bucs’ season-ending loss to Washington on Sunday and said the future of Todd Bowles as head coach must be studied. “If you’re talking about the Bucs coming into the offseason, I think we got to talk about Todd Bowles a little bit, man. I don’t like saying, ‘Hey, fire a guy.’ And I also have given him a lot of credit the last couple of years and this organization,” Long began. “But I want to say this, he’s got like a just-above-.500 record. It’s the worst division in football … over his tenure of the last couple of years. So my point is this: and I’m not saying fire the guy, but I’m saying you got to put him under the magnifying glass a little bit because of the way this team played down the stretch. “They were undisciplined down the stretch. There were games they were not ready to play. That Dallas game, they were not ready to play. That New Orleans game, they were not ready to play. They let Washington do exactly what Washington wanted to do. I know what Washington wanted to do; Washington wanted to possess the football and go on long drives and tire [the Bucs] out. And they did it. That shouldn’t be a team that can outphysical you. “On top of that, when you consider the fact that the record is just above .500 in the worst division in football, and the fact they could lose their offensive coordinator. I just think eventually a conversation has to be had about the future. And maybe it’s one more year but they got to [progress next season].” Long added that he did not think the Bucs played to their potential this season and Tampa Bay needs to be on a clear upswing next season for Bowles to be safe. He also added with a hint of Bucs-fan-like frustration. “… I just wanted to see better from this team [Sunday night].” Joe agrees to a degree, especially about how Bowles and the Bucs must show clear progress next season. Co-hosts and former NFL defensive tackles Nate Collins and Beau Allen countered Long, saying the Bucs “are still on a good trajectory” and they believe Bowles clearly deserves a 2025 season in Tampa to take the team to another level.|2025-01-14 13:10:00|457|80|5|Chris Long|Long discusses evaluating Todd Bowles' coaching future with the Bucs.|3|Mixed sentiment towards Todd Bowles, with dissatisfaction over recent performance and coaching decisions.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""AJ"", ""post"": ""This is what mccourty said and describes Todd Bowles.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/sam-darnold-is-no-baker-mayfield/|Sam Darnold Is No Baker Mayfield|So last night Joe watched Sam Darnold eat sack after sack against the Rams, nine total. It was like Joe tackling the midnight fried chicken fingers served in The Licht House press box. Joe has no love for the Vikings or Rams yet was heard shouting, “Get rid of the damn ball.” It started to feel like the game was fixed. First, officials mysteriously overruled a Rams fumble (video below), and then Darnold refused to throw the ball away. Joe brings this up because week after week, the 2024 edition of Darnold was compared to Baker Mayfield. Both were castoff quarterbacks and prime first-round picks. They were on the same Carolina roster in 2022 and both are in their late 20s. The difference? Mayfield played great ball during his two-game playoff run last season on his new team. Darnold was dreadful last week against Detroit (essentially a playoff game) and last night in his first playoff foray. Mayfield also was good Sunday night except for one brutal fumble. Joe is very pleased the Bucs have Mayfield, who is a true franchise quarterback turning 30 this year. He’s not a top-5 quarterback, but he’s certainly a top-10 guy. And the Bucs have him relatively cheap for the next two seasons. The Vikings aren’t quite sure what they have other than a quarterback controversy with free agent Darnold and injured rookie J.J.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/todd-bowles-is-safe-but-what-about-his-defensive-staff/|Todd Bowles Is Safe But What About His Defensive Staff?|Joe doesn’t have to guess. Joe can read how some Bucs fans are out for blood. Despite all logical signs, reason and information, including a very public statement from Bucs AC/DC-loving general manager Jason Licht of support for Todd Bowles, many, many, many fans are holding out hope that the head coach will be ousted. The Bucs, these Bucs fans are convinced, need to make someone pay for Sunday night. But the fans’ choice of the sacrificial lamb isn’t going anywhere. However, Joe doesn’t know about Bowles’ staff. Bowles has been unafraid to make staff changes on the offensive side of the ball when he sees fit. The defensive side? Not so much. Of course, for the second straight season, the Bucs finished with the fourth-worst passing yards allowed per game in the NFL. Once is bad, but two straight years? This year, four of the five teams with the worst passing yards allowed per game are all playoff teams (Baltimore, Detroit, the Bucs and Minnesota — Jacksonville was the worst). Two are still alive in the postseason. However, of the five worst 2023 teams in passing yards allowed per game (Commandos, Eagles, Chargers, Bucs, Bengals), only the Bucs have the same defensive staff as of last night. Cincinnati just let go of long-time defensive coordinator Lou Anarumo. The only 2023 team in the bottom-five for passing yards allowed per game that remained in the bottom-five for the 2024 season was the Bucs, despite an All-Pro safety, experienced players and a free agent safety brought in to shore up the pass defense. Something is not right on the defensive side of the ball.|2025-01-14 04:20:00|273|104|2|Todd Bowles|Fans want change in defensive staff despite loyalty to Bowles.|2|Overall sentiment is negative towards Todd Bowles, with criticisms about poor defense and coaching decisions.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""AllmanbrosBucs"", ""post"": ""\u2018YA THINK?????"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""14th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""5:35"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Joe in Michigan"", ""post"": ""I look forward to many, many, many years of pass rushers dropping into coverage to try to cover someone much faster or more shifty than them."", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""14th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""5:36"", ""am""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""FortMyersDave"", ""post"": ""Hey Joes, Ira mentioned something at the end of his podcast in that what if it becomes a sticking point if Bowles is asked by Team Glazer to hire a DC and/or launch some of his defensive coaches.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/todd-bowles-offenses-avoided-tykee-smith/|Todd Bowles: Offenses Avoided Tykee Smith|Tampa Bay’s rookie playmaker at nickel cornerback and safety had 2 interceptions, 7 passes defensed and 3 forced fumbles through Week 14. And that doesn’t count the one forced fumble Tykee Smith had stolen from him by referees. But in the final five games of the season, Smith didn’t register any of those stats. He was more quiet but not invisible. Joe asked Todd Bowles whether Smith’s playmaking fell off because he hit a rookie wall. Bowles said that wasn’t the case and even noted how offenses were respecting the rookie third-round pick. “He got banged up and he missed some time. He got banged up, he was playing with a knee [injury]. When he came back, he made the plays he was supposed to make,” Bowles said. “He set the edge, he did some good things and he was one of our best players on defense. “He didn’t hit a rookie wall at the end of the year. They started going away from him some and he started being a non-factor because the ball wasn’t showing up but he did everything he was supposed to do.” High praise there from Bowles. Frankly, Joe was surprised to hear the head coach say Smith was becoming “a non-factor,” but it was interesting to hear his belief teams were avoiding Smith. Joe knows Smith is held in very high regard at One Buc Palace. He’s certainly a rookie the team expects to take the second-year leap common among excellent players.|2025-01-14 04:19:00|248|19|6|Tykee Smith|Rookie Tykee Smith's playmaking impact analyzed by coach Todd Bowles.|3|Mixed sentiment towards the team's performance, some positive remarks but also criticism and concerns.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""OHBucFan"", ""post"": ""Good to hear but it also means that there were many other places on the field for the opponents to attack.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/he-was-crestfallen/|“He Was Crestfallen”|As Joe has typed many times, the Bucs won’t look the same when the team shows up for underwear football after the draft. Teams rarely are the same. The 2021 Bucs were the rare exception after winning the Super Bowl. The Bucs wanted to “run it back,” and they nearly did bringing back 22+1 starters. So a lot of current Bucs won’t be around in a few weeks. Off to other teams. Off to looking for work. Off to retirement. (Man, Kyle Trask’s locker was one of the few completely empty yesterday as players were cleaning out their year’s worth of mess. Someone did a fast getaway.) Former local sports radio voice Jay Recher has a bad feeling that Bucs legend Lavonte David is off to retirement. Recher didn’t like the vibes he got listening to David in the Bucs’ locker room after the playoff loss Sunday night. “He was crestfallen,” Recher said. “You could tell, man. There was a semblance of, ‘That’s it. That was it.'” Recher also cited how K.J. Britt, whose locker is next to David’s, appeared shook, which added to Recher’s hunch that Sunday was it for David. Well, it may very well be it for Britt. So Joe won’t put much stock into Britt’s reaction. He’s a free agent and has no idea about his future. Joe spoke with Britt yesterday at One Buc Palace. If David wasn’t seriously injured Sunday, once the pain wears off and the emotion fades, perhaps David will look back at his excellent season and remember he can’t find a few million dollars lying on the sidewalk — and decide he still has gas in the tank for another year. Joe sure hopes so.|2025-01-14 04:00:00|284|28|5|Lavonte David|Uncertain future for Buccaneers players after intense playoff loss.|7|Mixed sentiments with hope for Lavonte's return and concerns about the team's future without him.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""1sparkybuc"", ""post"": ""One more please.

Per Ian Rapoport of NFL Network by way of Josh Alper of Pro Football Talk, it appears Spytek is in a five-person race for the job, though six men are in their second round of talks with the Titans. So why does Joe think it’s just a five-man race? One of the six who advanced to the second round is the Bears’ assistant general manager. Really? The Bears? At first Joe thought this was a joke. Like one of the men responsible for building one of the worst organizations in football is a serious candidate for a general manager’s job? Yeah, sure. Give Joe a friggin’ break. Others in the running are, per Turron Davenport of BSPN, Bills director of player personnel Terrance Gray, Chiefs assistant general manager Mike Borgonzi, Colts assistant general manager Ed Dodds and Packers vice president of player personnel Jon-Eric Sullivan. Joe would hate to see Spytek go. Good guy. Clearly does good work. For Spytek’s sake, Joe hopes the Titans don’t ask Spytek about edge rushers.|2025-01-14 03:45:00|200|7|5|John Spytek|Spytek advances in Titans GM job race.|3|Mixed feelings about potential changes in management, uncertainty over future success and development.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Leopold Stotch"", ""post"": ""I still don\u2019t think that it\u2019s our front office that can\u2019t find edge rushers.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/was-the-jet-sweep-a-bad-call/|Was The Jet Sweep A Bad Call?|Joe sees a lot of howling comments from folks outraged that Liam Coen, the savvy Bucs offensive coordinator, called for a jet sweep late in the game deep in Bucs territory. Baker Mayfield botched the handoff to Jalen McMillan. Four plays later Jayden Daniels threw a touchdown pass to Terry McLaurin and that turned out to be the ballgame. Up in the press box on Joe’s laptop after the play, Joe had a looping replay of the NBC broadcast feed showing a tight portion of the field. Yesterday, a few statheads Joe respects were retweeting a message from someone named Theo Ash. The message was a plea for work, as this NFL analyst tries to make a living breaking down football videos on TikTok. Thanks to the ill-conceived TikTok ban set to kick in on Saturday, Ash and many, many others will be out of work soon. Ash also believes the jet sweep play was set up for a monster gain because of the lack of defenders on the left side. Ash noted that this season when Coen called this play, it almost always got good yardage. Once when defenders sniffed it out right away in Atlanta, Chris Godwin was held to just a two-yard gain but enough for a first down. Ash also showed how Mayfield used two hands to attempt the hand off to McMillan, whereas in the past, Mayfield used one hand. Is that why there was a fumble? Had the fumble not happened, Ash noted, McMillan would have had a “very soft edge” as the only two defenders near the play would have been blocked by Tristan Wirfs and Rakim Jarrett. However, Ash was only using the NBC broadcast feed tape to break down the play. Joe will look at the All-22 today. In all, this was an interesting breakdown by Ash. Joe wishes he heard of this guy long before TikTok goes poof.
