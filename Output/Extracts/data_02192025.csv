https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/mocking-a-receiver-to-the-buccaneers-in-round-1/|Mocking A Receiver To The Buccaneers In Round 1|So a premier NFL insider says his new 2025 mock draft is based on “doing it from talking to people, using my ears.” Those cochlear vibrations are inside the head of NFL Network draft guru Daniel Jeremiah. He’s the former Eagles, Ravens and Browns scout who also was a college quarterback. Jeremiah cranked out his second mock draft of this year’s silly season and placed University of Arizona junior wide receiver Tetairoa McMillan in Tampa Bay’s lap at No. 19 overall. He’s 6-5, 210 pounds and gives off some Mike Evans vibes. But would the Bucs dare to re-sign Chris Godwin and draft McMillan? It’s doubtful, but certainly not out of the question if the Bucs believe McMillan is a true stud to replace Mike Evans down the line. McMillan posted big numbers for usually bad Arizona teams. In Jeremiah’s scenario, McMillan is the first receiver off the board not named Travis Hunter. On the surface, picking McMillan might seem ludicrous, but Buccaneers Ring of Honor general manager Jason Licht is paid to work his magic deep below the surface. The practical side of Licht needs to consider who will be catching balls for the Bucs when it comes time to talk about renewing Baker Mayfield’s contract that expires after the 2026 season. Yes, Joe knows all about Jalen McMillan, the Bucs’ standout rookie receiver last season. But Joe doesn’t view McMillan as a No. 1 receiver.|2025-02-19 17:58:00|237|57|2|Tetairoa McMillan|NFL draft scenario with doubts on receiver selection by Buccaneers.|5|Mixed sentiment about focusing on defense, drafting WR, taking best player available, and past picks.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""MadMax"", ""post"": ""Lol, yeah ok"", ""post_time"": [""February"", ""19th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""6:15"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Redzone"", ""post"": ""All for it if it\u2019s BPA \u2013 Bucs need veterans to help their D imo not more draft picks to hopefully develop in the Spring and be ready day 1"", ""post_time"": [""Redzone""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""Rod Munch"", ""post"": ""The Bucs won a Super Bowl with Evans, Godwin, and AB at WR."", ""post_time"": [""February"", ""19th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""6:18"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter3"": {""username"": ""Danfan"", ""post"": ""I was reading through a Rod Munch comment and thinking what a pleasant surprise it is not to see him bang on about Baker\u2019s fumble, but of course, at the end it still came.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/john-franklin-myers-and-the-bucs/|John Franklin-Myers And The Bucs|Remember when the slimy Saints and their head coach Sean Payton let stud edge rusher Trey Hendrickson walk out of their building to Cincinnati in free agency? What a move! Their pass defense has never been the same. Payton now has another edge rusher/inside rusher that may be on the move because of salary concerns: John Franklin-Myers. Over at NFL.com, there is speculation in a piece about potential salary cap casualties that Payton’s Broncos will part ways with the 28-year-old pass rusher who found 7 sacks and 18 QB hits in part-time duty last season. The Broncos are right in the middle of the league in cap space and have a promising quarterback (Bo Nix) on his rookie contract, so they’re not in bad shape financially. That said, if they want to make extra room — perhaps to acquire some weaponry for Nix — the first candidate for release would be John Franklin-Myers. Despite appearing in all 17 games (16 starts), Franklin-Myers played just 46 percent of defensive snaps. He still managed seven sacks and 18 QB hits on those snaps, which is a solid production rate, but he carries a $10 million cap hit in 2025 and can be released prior to June 1 for $7 million in savings. It’s not a necessary move by any means, but it’s a possible one, depending on Denver’s priorities. Kudos to the Broncos for trading only a sixth-round pick to the Jets for the rights to Franklin-Myers during last year’s draft. Franklin-Myers is sort of a more ferocious version of Logan Hall. He can play the run and he can play outside and inside, though he certainly has been more dangerous as an inside rusher. Joe will put it this way, Franklin-Myers has 52 quarterback hits through the past three seasons versus 17 for Hall. Joe wouldn’t chase Franklin-Myers if he were cut, but Joe could see Todd Bowles absolutely loving Franklin-Myers for his size, versatility and juice. Perhaps he could replace Greg Gaines? Before fans ask why the Broncos would feel comfortable dumping the guy, Joe suspects it has a lot to do with the team leading the NFL with 63 sacks last season.|2025-02-19 16:40:00|363|14|4|John Franklin-Myers|Broncos may release Franklin-Myers due to salary concerns.|4|Mixed reactions to potential roster moves and strategic considerations in NFL team discussions.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Defense Rules"", ""post"": ""Joe \u2026 \u2018speculation in a piece about potential salary cap casualties that Payton\u2019s Broncos will part ways with the 28-year-old pass rusher who found 7 sacks and 18 QB hits in part-time duty last season.\u2019"", ""post_time"": [""February"", ""19th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""5:17"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Rod Munch"", ""post"": ""The NFL article reminds me of those ridiculous pieces about how the Bucs might cut Mike Evans this offseason.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/bucs-can-now-afford-a-real-edge-rusher/|Bucs Can Now Afford A Real Edge Rusher|The reasons for the Bucs not going out and getting an established edge rusher are about dried up thanks to an NFL news release today. Though the 2025 salary cap numbers are not yet finalized, the NFL announced salary caps are expected to rise by some $22 million per team, notes Dan Graziano of ESPN. That’s a big jump. So if you think a top-shelf defensive end makes $20 million a year, which Myles Garrett does, for example does, the Bucs can afford such a salary now. Before, the Bucs would likely have had to sacrifice someone like Chris Godwin to bring in a stud like Garrett. No more. However, Joe knows teams are somewhat aware of the pending annual salary cap increase before it is revealed. Joe was prepared to listen to the Bucs next month cry poor for passing (again) on an edge rusher saying they couldn’t mess up their salary cap. It’s valid rationale, if not smart and responsible. It’s also convenient. Now? Well, teams will have to concoct savvy reasons for not adding a key player at a crucial position — even if a team has a Grand Canyon-sized hole at said position. And for a team on the cusp of making a Super Bowl run like the Bucs, it’s even more critical to fill that void.

What a sweet day that will be. Free agency kicks off at high noon Monday, March 10, and the Bucs have money to spend (and they can craft more salary cap space if needed). Given the backup center Robert Hainsey is outta here, per Tristan Wirfs, Joe thinks the Bucs might be hunting a quality guy at the position. Even better if it’s a player who can give quality input to Graham Barton. That brings Joe to pending free agent Lucas Patrick, who started 10 games for the slimy Saints last season. Not only is Patrick a fellow Duke guy like Barton, he spent several years at Duke when rookie Bucs offensive coordinator Josh Grizzard was an assistant coach there. Patrick, 31, spent five years with Aaron Rodgers (two as a starter) before moving on to the Bears and Saints. He played last season for near the NFL minimum. Joe’s not saying Patrick is better than Hainsey, but he certainly has more experience and he’s played plenty of guard, as well. Undrafted in 2016, Patrick has grinded out a hell of a career for himself.

In his 2024 season wrap up, Todd Bowles singled out Luke Goedeke and Izien as players who took their games to another level. “I thought Christian Izien before he got hurt made great strides and did a lot of things well,” Bowles said. The Bucs list Izien at 5-foot-10, but that’s a big stretch because he was 5-8 when he came out of college. He played primarily in the slot as a rookie and then showcased his versatility last year as Bowles used him as a valuable chess piece, with rookie Tykee Smith assuming most of the nickel duties. “Izien’s a good athlete,” says co-defensive coordinator Larry Foote. “He’s quick, he’s fast and he likes to play the game. When we were looking at him at Rutgers, we knew he had the right DNA we would want.” The Bucs are hoping Antoine Winfield Jr. can stay healthy and rebound from an injury-riddled season. Jordan Whitehead was disappointing in his second stint with Tampa Bay and it should shock no one if Izien moves into a starting safety role this fall. At the moment, Bowles loves the ability to play Izien at strong safety, free safety and even corner. After the Week 10 loss against San Francisco, Bowles singled out Izien as Tampa Bay’s best defensive player that afternoon. Izien’s season ended prematurely in a 26-24 setback at Dallas when he suffered a pectoral injury. He was placed on I.R. and was sidelined the final three games, including the playoff matchup against the Commanders. Izien went out on a high note with 13 stops against the Cowboys, three more tackles than anyone else on the field at Jerry’s World. This is not to suggest Izien is a finished product. He’s a willing tackler, aggressive in run support, but Izien needs to take better angles and wrap up more efficiently. He also needs to improve his coverage skills, but there’s a reason Izien was on the field for 75 percent of Tampa Bay’s defensive snaps last season — Bowles loves his work ethic and competitive nature. “He’s a tough kid, very smart,” Bowles says. At the age of 24, Izien is young enough to absorb coaching suggestions and refine his technique. He plays hard, with an impressive burst, and Izien’s versatility makes him a valuable asset for a defense that allowed the most completions in the league in 2024. You’d better believe Izien isn’t satisfied with being considered a prized backup. The third-year pro aspires to be a full-time starter and if Whitehead fails to recapture his previous form, Izien just might get his wish.|2025-02-19 10:49:00|485|16|8|Christian Izien|Undrafted standout aims for starting role with Tampa Bay Buccaneers.|6|Mixed sentiment with some praise and concerns about depth and coaching strategy.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""JimBobBuc"", ""post"": ""He had some great games.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/bucs-assistant-named-to-risers-list/|Bucs Assistant Named To Risers List|The Bucs may have lost a top, young up-and-comer in the NFL when Liam Coen bolted to the Jags. However, The Athletic believes the Bucs were able to retain the services of another. Jourdan Rodrigue and Mike Jones cobbled together a list of the top 50 NFL people under 40 years old — NFL suits, media and (weirdly) agents — whose careers are on a steep upward trajectory. Hey, why not the cops who work games to keep us safe on Sundays or the best street food salesmen working the sidewalks outside the stadiums? The cops and the shish kabob vendors on Himes Avenue have a more direct impact with everyday fans than agents do. Anyway, Bucs quarterbacks coach Thad Lewis is on this list. The Athletic is of the mind that Lewis won’t just be a QB coach much longer. … …Lewis has played a role in Baker Mayfield’s career revival. The former Duke quarterback and NFL journeyman was a coaching intern with Tampa Bay in 2020 and then served as assistant wide receivers coach in 2021 and 2022. Lewis took over as quarterbacks coach in 2023 and helped position Mayfield for back-to-back 4,000-yard campaigns and a pair of Pro Bowl nods. As a result, Lewis has started generating interest on the offensive coordinator level. What Joe finds interesting is that on this list are a few either former Bucs coaches (like Coen and former Bucs receivers coach Brad Idzik, who is now the Stinking Panthers offensive coordinator) or guys the Bucs interviewed to replace Coen like Nate Scheelhaase and Grant Udinski. So it is clear the Bucs were swinging for the fences to look for the best man to fill Coen’s void. That’s a double-edged sword the Bucs are playing with. If the Bucs and Baker Mayfield have success again this fall, it’s a decent bet that offensive coordinator Josh Grizzard and/or Lewis will be working somewhere else next winter.|2025-02-19 10:30:00|322|19|7|Thad Lewis|Talented Bucs coach primed for bigger role.|5|Mixed opinions on coaching staff changes and potential success, with some skepticism and admiration.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Larry"", ""post"": ""If the Bucs had an offensive minded head coach this would never be a problem!!!"", ""post_time"": [""February"", ""19th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""10:42"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""AL121976"", ""post"": ""I think Grizzard will be here for at least 2 yrs as long as Bowles is HC"", ""post_time"": [""February"", ""19th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""10:44"", ""am""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""SlyPirate"", ""post"": ""Who wouldn\u2019t want to be a coach for the Bucs offense?

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/rasul-douglas-and-the-bucs/|Rasul Douglas And The Bucs|Anyone who just casually reads this site knows Joe has one singular goal, want, desire if not demand for the Bucs when the free agency dinner bell rings in two weeks. And that laser-focused target is for the Bucs to break down, have a come-to-Jesus moment, and go get a friggin’ edge rusher, for crying out loud! A legitimate one. Not everyone seems to agree with Joe. Include seven-year NFL safety and current Chicagoland high school coach and BSPN contributor Matt Bowen. Bowen instead thinks the Bucs need a cornerback (Joe doesn’t disagree but thinks this is Priority-B or Priority-C). And the man Bowen has in mind is current Buffalo corner Rusal Douglas. So doing simple math here, it seems Bowen is suggesting Douglas should replace Jamel Dean. Surely Bowen isn’t saying that Zyon McCollum, in his first full season as a starting cornerback and tied for third with the most passes defended, should be benched. Douglas seems like a nice fit. Best of all, he stays on the field. Douglas has played in 48 regular season games the past three years. He hasn’t missed more than two games in a season since he was with the Packers in 2021. Dean has played in 40 regular season games the past three years. Dean had more picks last season (one) than Douglas (none). Joe isn’t sure if Douglas fits what Todd Bowles wants. But gosh darn it, this Douglas answers the bell. So yeah, Joe would be OK if the Bucs sign Douglas.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/jason-licht-a/|Jason Licht Gets An A- For 2024 Rookies|Boy, now this is a tough grading curve. The Bucs’ 2024 rookie class was really something else. Only one rookie didn’t produce, and that guy is a backup on one of the best offensive lines in the game. In other words, Elijah Klein is in a logjam. Gennaro Filice of NFL.com decided to rank the rookie classes of 2024. He gave Bucs AC/DC-loving general manager Jason Licht an A- grade. It was well earned. Overall, Filice ranked the Bucs rookies as the No. 5 class overall. The running back position is returning to prominence in the NFL, while nickelback has never been hotter. So, kudos to you, Jason Licht, for uncovering a dynamic talent at each spot in the middle rounds of the ’24 draft. The sixth running back selected in what was widely viewed as an underwhelming prospect crop at the position, Bucky Irving wasn’t just the best rookie RB but one of the most elusive players in the entire league. Next Gen Stats credited him with forcing a missed tackle on 35.8 percent of touches — the top rate in the NFL (min. 100 touches). NGS also had him averaging 5.5 yards per carry on rushes outside the tackles (fifth-best, min. 50 such carries) and 5.3 yards per carry on rushes inside the tackles (second-best). Oh, and he paced all rookie backs in catches (47) and receiving yards (392). Just an all-around baller — like Tykee Smith, who flourished in the nickel role as a savvy defender against the run and pass. With Todd Bowles praising the versatile DB throughout his rookie campaign, the only thing that really held Smith back was a midseason knee injury that cost him four games. It’s a testament to Irving and Smith’s stellar play that I’m only now getting to Tampa Bay’s first-round pick, Graham Barton, who provided exactly what the Buccaneers desired at the pivot. … In the passing game, Jalen McMillan started slow but finished with a flurry … Look, even Todd Bowles and Licht were getting production from a seventh-round pick. Tight end Devin Culp showed the NFL isn’t too big for him late in the season when the games really mattered. Culp averaged nearly 18 yards a catch. That’s pretty freaking good for the 246th pick in the draft. Filice’s top four teams were Washington (remember: Even when it’s not about the quarterback, it’s about the quarterback), Los Angeles Rams (with their first- and second-round defensive line arsekickers), Los Angeles Chargers (Joe Alt is the next Tristan Wirfs) and Las Vegas. It’s hard to argue against Washington and the Los Angeles Rams but other than those two, Joe doesn’t see a draft class better than the Bucs’.|2025-02-19 03:45:00|449|15|10|Jason Licht|Exceptional rookie class earns A- grade|4|Mixed opinions on Bucs draft performance, with some optimism and skepticism expressed by commenters.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""stpetebucsfan"", ""post"": ""Two rookies stood out so much that clearly the Bucs are #2."", ""post_time"": [""February"", ""19th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""5:19"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Vanessa Anne"", ""post"": ""I can see the Commanders and the Rams.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/contract-agreement-between-bucs-chris-godwin-suggests-serious-talks-underway/|Contract Deadline Agreement Between Bucs, Chris Godwin Suggests Serious Talks Underway|This seems to Joe that the odds (whatever they may be) that Bucs receiver Chris Godwin may return for the 2025 season just got better. Per Greg Auman of FOX Sports, Godwin and the Bucs have agreed to extend a deadline that buys both parties a couple of weeks to hammer out a deal to keep Godwin with the Bucs before Godwin hits free agency. The Bucs and Godwin now have until March 12 to work out a contract. At 4 p.m. on March 12, the new league year begins. It’s also when the free agency dinner bell rings. (Legal tampering begins March 10. Illegal tampering ramps up next week at the combine.) If Godwin’s contract had voided on Tuesday, which it was originally supposed to do, per Auman, it would have sparked an $18 million dead money cap hit against the Bucs’ 2025 cap. So if the Bucs are able to ink a deal with Godwin before the new league year/start of free agency, it will save the Bucs a nice piece of change against the cap.|2025-02-19 00:00:00|178|30|8|Chris Godwin|Contract extension negotiations progressing positively.|7|Mixed sentiments with optimism about potential resigning but concerns about salary cap management.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""MadMax"", ""post"": ""\ud83d\ude42"", ""post_time"": [""February"", ""19th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""12:04"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Brian in St Pete"", ""post"": ""This is a good sign.
