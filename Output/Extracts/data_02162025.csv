https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/bruce-arians-says-health-drove-him-from-bucs-job/|Bruce Arians Says Health Drove Him From Bucs Job|The story behind Bucco Bruce Arians retiring as Bucs head coach three years ago always seems to take a slightly different form each time it’s told by the guy who knows the whole truth. When Arians stunned the NFL world and stepped down in late March of 2022, he gave the story to longtime NFL writers Sam Farmer and Peter King in an exclusive interview. Farmer didn’t mention Arians’ health in his feature story, and Arians personal statement made it clear his retirement wasn’t about health. Arians wrote the following: “Before you start thinking this is about my health, don’t. This is the best I have felt in many years.” Then Arians told Rock Riley last February that health was a factor in him stepping down. During a sitdown last month with retired college basketball coach Mark Gottfried, Arians made it sound like health was a major factor in him handing the job over to Todd Bowles. “Health, it got very, very hard for me to stand on the sidelines [in 2021]; I tore my Achilles like the third week of the season — 90 percent of my Achilles,” Arians said. “So I had those damn high heels on and back pain. I mean, I had to have help get undressed after the games. And it got to the point I was like, ‘I don’t know if I can physically do this, I’ll do it for one more year.’ “Because Tom [Brady] was going to retire, alright, I didn’t want to hand it over to somebody without a quarterback. So Tom decided to come back, I said, ‘Phew, perfect. You know, I can step back and give this thing to Todd knowing that he’s got a shot. He’s a better shot than he had in New York.’ It was time for him because one more year wasn’t going to do anything [for me] anyway. But physically, it got really, really hard. And I can’t imagine standing on the sideline for four hours now, you know, just with the bad back I have. That part you miss. When I was sitting on the bench during games, I knew it was time. I used to go over to talk to the quarterbacks just so I could sit down.” Joe is always interested in Bucs history, and what a stunning moment it was when Arians stepped aside for Bowles. It remains bizarre why, in 2022, Arians didn’t want the world to think health was a reason he quit, yet he’s leaning more and more into that reason with each passing year.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/chris-godwin-and-the-bucs-defense/|Chris Godwin And The Bucs Defense|Will the Bucs be able to keep Chris Godwin or will he walk out the door? That should be answered in the next three or four weeks. Maybe sooner. The long-time Bucs Pro Bowl receiver is a pending free agent. The free agency dinner bell is about to ring. Legal tampering begins March 10. Illegal tampering ramps up next week at the combine (yes, next week!). Years ago, Team Glazer liked saying the Bucs have never let a good player walk out the door of One Buc Palace that they wanted to keep. We shall see with Godwin. Scott Smith of Buccaneers.com, who has an office inside One Buc Palace, believes the Bucs will do their best to keep Godwin. As of today, the Bucs rank in the bottom-third of available salary cap space. So how do the Bucs plan to allocate that Team Glazer loot? The Bucs were 4-3 with Godwin on the field last season. They were 6-4 without him. With all the needs on defense (Lavonte David’s status remains a mystery), do the Bucs try to talk themselves into believing they can win without Godwin? The Bucs have a damn good running game with a damn good offensive line. New Bucs offensive coordinator Josh Grizzard likely wants to ground-and-pound. When he spent over an hour with the local pen and mic club two weeks ago, he didn’t give any indication that he’s a pass-happy guy. So does Team Glazer balk at paying two receivers at least $20 million each if the Bucs aren’t going to be a pass-first team, especially with so many holes in the defense? In theory, you want the ball most often in the hands of your best and highest-priced offensive skill position players. You know, earn your daily bread? Look, Joe wants Godwin back as much as the next Bucs fan. But Joe can also see how the Bucs could hoodwink themselves into believing Godwin, who turns 29 this month, is more a luxury than a necessity. The Bucs were done in last year by their p!ss-poor pass defense, not the absence of Godwin.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/free-agency-countdown-22-days-the-bucs-and-shaquill-griffin/|Free Agency Countdown: 22 Days — The Bucs And Shaquill Griffin|The keg is ordered, the trays of Hooters boneless wings and Mahi tacos will arrive early. The dessert pies will come pre-sliced. The menu at JoeBucsFan.com world headquarters is set for the start of free agency at noon on Monday, March 10. Now who will the Bucs sign? A year ago, the Bucs ran out and got a veteran outside cornerback early in free agency. That was Bryce Hall, and he was set to be the No. 3 corner behind Jamel Dean and Zyon McCollum. In Week 1, Hall dislocated his ankle and broke his leg. He never played again. Joe thinks that injury impacted the defense. The team was painfully thin and inexperienced behind Hall. Might the Bucs bring back Hall on a minimum contract? Or will they look to replace him in free agency? That brings Joe to pending Vikings free agent Shaquill Griffin, the 29-year-old St. Petersburg native and 2019 Pro Bowler out of the University of Central Florida. The 2017 Seattle third-round pick signed a huge free agent contract with the Jaguars in 2021. Then he bounced between the Texans and Panthers and last year found a home in Minnesota within the blitz-happy Brian Flores defense. Griffin played all 17 games (3 starts) and finished with 2 interceptions, 6 passes defensed and 41 combined tackles. Simply put, he can still play. Might Griffin want to come home? If the Bucs keep injury-prone Dean, then they certainly need a capable body behind him. Griffin earned $4.5 million last season and likely will cost in that same neighborhood if Minnesota lets him walk.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/josh-grizzard-talks-not-having-to-fake-it-and-communication-skills/|Josh Grizzard Talks Not Having “To Fake It” And Communication Skills|Rookie Bucs offensive coordinator Josh Grizzard is 34 years old with eight seasons of NFL coaching experience. How did he climb the ladder so quickly? Joe previously shared Rachaad White’s comments on Grizzard after he was hired to replace Liam “El Serpiente” Coen last month. “Swaggy dude. Brilliant mind. Young, electric, good energy” is how White described Grizzard. During an exclusive interview on The JoeBucsFan Show on WDAE radio yesterday, Joe asked Grizzard about White’s assessment. “I appreciate Rachaad saying that,” Grizzard began. “I like to bring energy and be enthusiastic about what I do. And it’s not something for me to be able to fake it because I generally enjoy coming to work. It doesn’t feel like work. It’s not fun to lose, but I love being around the players, the coaches, behind the scenes creating the plays, and then see them executed on gameday.” Bucs running backs coach Skip Peete told Joe that all coaches can communicate to players but Grizzard relates to them extremely well, and that should make him very effective. “Yeah, I feel like I’m just speaking to [players] how I normally speak,” Grizzard said. “And so, I think maybe based on my age that that can resonate with even some of the younger guys a little bit more. When it comes to the football side of it, I do feel like I can try to take something that is somewhat complex and be able to compare it to something else that simplifies it in their mind — to be able to go out an execute at a high level on game day.” “I think that’s at the root of coaching, is showing guys that you care. And then once they know you care, then you’re able to communicate with them at a level to explain what you want to get out of a a play or a concept.” Grizzard added that it’s important to treat players differently, to understand “how learn how they learn, how they operate, how they work and meet them halfway on getting a point across.” Ira Kaufman Talks Jason Licht Popularity, Decision-Making Conversations, Chris Godwin, Underachievement Debate, And Much More |2025-02-16 09:11:00|360|8|7|Josh Grizzard|Young offensive coordinator excels in communication and coaching effectiveness.|6|Mixed sentiment about new coach Grizzard, ranging from optimism to concerns about accountability.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""BUC CHEEKS"", ""post"": ""\u201cDescribed Coen?\u201d  Think you meant Grizzard yeah?"", ""post_time"": [""February"", ""16th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""9:21"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Mac"", ""post"": ""I think before long with will be saying Grizzard the Wizard.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/the-dominance-of-tristan-wirfs/|The “Dominance” Of Tristan Wirfs|The late, great Martin Fennelly, sort of an iconic sports columnist/humorist, who worked for both the Tampa Tribune and the Tampa Bay Times, had a saying he often used. That would be, “You can’t write enough about the stars.” Fennelly should have been a network TV executive. That’s the way national sports networks are programmed. Feature the stars and the eyeballs will come. So who is the star with the Bucs? Probably Mike Evans, though he’s sort of a quiet type. The quiet types get less buzz because, well, they prefer being in the background even if their play puts them on a pedestal. (This should apply to Lavonte David but his play never seems to put him on a pedestal even though his play has been elite throughout his career.) Baker Mayfield is sort of a star. He certainly was in college and some of that shine has carried with him to the Bucs. He’s backed that up with his play, too. But this past offseason Mayfield has been David-like — staying in the shadows. How about Tristan Wirfs? A two-time All-Pro, Wirfs just pulled off the unthinkable by being named All-Pro this past season for his play at left tackle after winning the award at right tackle. That was a first in NFL history. Wirfs showed up at Radio Row at the Super Bowl and made appearances on big-time shows and podcasts. So Wirfs, arguably, if you combine his play with his newfound national media hype, is probably the Bucs’ star as we stand in the middle of February. Zack Rosenblatt of The Athletic recently documented how much of a hot streak Wirfs has been on. Wirfs took a leap into dominance in 2024, not allowing any sacks in 638 pass-blocking snaps — and he’s held opponents without a sack for 776 consecutive pass-blocking snaps dating back to last season. He allowed one QB hit all season (to star edge rusher Maxx Crosby) and only allowed nine pressures in true pass sets. That’s damn dominant. And Wirfs is only 26 (he turns 27 a week from tomorrow). So long as Wirfs stays healthy, damn, Joe can only imagine how good Wirfs can be. Joe doesn’t think you could ask for a better player and a better guy for the Bucs to embrace as a star. And he’s just getting started.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/02/two-edge-rushers/|Two Edge Rushers?|Joe doesn’t think Bucs AC/DC-loving general manager Jason Licht would do this. Still, it’s an interesting thought. Does Joe need to repeat how badly the Bucs need an edge rusher? It’s pretty clear to most people but Joe isn’t sure if the right people fully embrace this notion. How bad is the edge rushing? Bad enough that Joe would add two pass rushers this offseason. If the Bucs wanted to draft an edge rusher and add a legitimate edge rusher — not some dude who gets four sacks and comes with hope of repeating another accident like when Shaq Barrett blew up — Joe would be fully OK with that. But Joe doesn’t believe Licht will do that. The man behind WalterFootball.com thinks if the Bucs are serious about contending for a Super Bowl, they have to address the Bucs’ biggest hole, which also happens to be at its most important defensive position. Two Edge Rushers: YaYa Diaby has emerged as a dangerous edge rusher, but Tampa Bay’s other young edge rushers have disappointed. The Buccaneers need some better pass rushers so they don’t have to blitz as often. Joe wouldn’t call YaYa “dangerous.” Joe likes the guy a lot. But Joe’s line of demarcation is 10 sacks. Sort of like batting .300 in baseball. If you can’t hit .300, then you’re not a special hitter. Consequentially, if a guy cannot get 10 sacks in 17 games, in Joe’s mind he’s not a dangerous sack guy. I f YaYa had help from the other side, he may just hit double-digits. What about second-year man Chris Braswell? No, Joe’s not giving up on him but he had pretty close to zero production last year. If he wasn’t on the roster, he wouldn’t have been missed. He had 1.5 sacks. History suggests the vast majority of rookie edge rushers are underwhelming. So Joe isn’t going to kill Braswell. But 1.5 sacks for Braswell on a team that didn’t have good edge rushers playing ahead of him? That’s just 1.5 more sacks than you and Joe — and a guy with a nice salary who couldn’t put the bong down (allegedly) to go to one practice. Joe doesn’t believe in banking on hope and right now banking on Braswell in 2025 is just that. It’s not crazy for the Bucs to add two edge rushers. If the Bucs do that, it tells Joe they really believe they can unseat the Eagles as the big dawgs of the NFC.|2025-02-16 00:00:00|415|33|4|Jason Licht|Bucs consider adding two edge rushers to strengthen defense.|2|Mixed sentiment with frustration over edge rusher situation and coaching decisions.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""MadMax"", ""post"": ""Serious question.
