https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/report-liam-coen-tells-bucs-see-ya/|Report: Liam Coen Tells Bucs, See Ya!|It appears Joe can now start to refer to Liam Coen as “former Bucs offensive coordinator.” Per Jeff Howe of The Athletic, Coen has informed the Bucs he won’t be back with the team. He’s moving on. He found another job. Coen told the Bucs he will accept an offer as the new coach of the Jags. There are reports floating around that Coen was offered “Ben Johnson money,” which is some $13 million annually. Oh, and Coen gets to pick his general manager. Hey, Joe can’t blame any guy for bolting for $13 million a year to run your own NFL franchise even if it is in snowy Jacksonville. But the way Coen went about it using a sick child as a shield to hide why he (allegedly) wouldn’t respond to the Bucs all day while instead (allegedly) secretly fly to Jacksonville (allegedly) without the Bucs knowledge (if you believe multiple reports).

LaVonte, Mike, Chris, Tristan, Cade, Luke, Antoine, Kancey, McCollum, and a kicker! And we outplayed the 2022 team! Then 2024 and Barton and Bucky and Tykee and that rookie receiver with 8 TDs. Forget his name. Anyway McMillan?  Whatever, a strong group with good leadership and young. Notice how Canales and Coen weren\u2019t even mentioned in this group? Hey guys not very much has changed except we keep getting a little better each year. We don\u2019t know what went down in Coen deal except for speculation. I like Liam and that kind of money would be impossible to turn down. He and his family are set for life. I have no interest in bashing his decision. I only hope if the jag off Jags are on our schedule one day that we will beat them in the most cruel and disgusting way possible. Otherwise we have a draft to get ready for and a few coaches to hire. Easy Peasy with the crew we\u2019re working with!!

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/thad-lewis-bruce-arians-and-the-next-bucs-offensive-coordinator/|Thad Lewis, Bruce Arians And The Next Bucs Offensive Coordinator|So with heralded Bucs playcaller Liam Coen’s departure feeling imminent (that rat bast&^%), who will be handed the job of offensive coordinator? Joe thinks the Bucs are yearning to stay in house, though that doesn’t mean they will. And in house is quarterbacks coach Thad Lewis, the former NFL backup and Duke graduate who was hired to be a Bucs offensive assistant in 2021. Lewis was handpicked by Bucco Bruce Arians after serving the Bucs as a coaching intern. Arians talked the guy up publicly and privately as a future offensive coordinator. Lewis was promoted to quarterbacks coach for the 2023 season. Joe has seen plenty of QB coaches get a lot of credit for their quarterbacks’ performance over the years (see Dave Canales in Seattle), so how much love does Lewis deserve for Mayfield’s two-season resurrection and surge? Joe can’t answer that, but Joe can say that Lewis certainly understands the current Bucs playbook and how it evolved this season, and how it was transitioned from the Canales Bucs playbook in 2023. Lewis also got a second year as QB coach. If Mayfield didn’t respect him, that wouldn’t have happened. It’s unclear whether Lewis can call plays, but would Arians be willing to come back to the coaching staff to mentor Lewis during the offseason on playcalling? Working alongside legendary playcaller Tom Moore? Arians is insanely loyal and Lewis is “his guy.” It’s very important to Arians to have his guys get opportunities and advance their careers. Lewis interviewed for the job Coen got a year ago. He’s well liked, Joe has heard, and that includes among many of his former teammates. If Mayfield doesn’t want to learn a brand new playbook from scratch, and he wants great input into the offense, then Lewis might have a leg up on replacing Coen. Especially if Mr. Arians is willing to step up.|2025-01-23 22:49:00|312|58|4|Thad Lewis|Potential promotion to Bucs offensive coordinator under Arians.|3|Mixed sentiments towards potential OC hires, varying from optimism to skepticism and disappointment.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""OR Buc"", ""post"": ""This sucks.

Sounds appropriate. But a bunch of national media types earlier today claimed the Bucs (no names mentioned, of course) were trying to reach Coen for many, many hours but couldn’t. Welcome to the circus off Dale Mabry Highway. “Liam Coen said he reached out to Bucs HC Todd Bowles to inform him of his interest in interviewing for the Jaguars head coaching job,” ESPN insider Adam Schefter wrote on Twitter. Earlier, Schefter wrote, “the Buccaneers have had no contact today with Liam Coen or his representation. The team has made multiple efforts to reach him and has not.” Perhaps Bowles didn’t take the call or open the text? Maybe he was afraid to, or perhaps he was unafraid of Coen heading to the mess that is the Jaguars. After all, the Bucs may have the strongest team culture in the NFL, so they say at One Buc Palace. This is all very intriguing.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/door-should-still-be-open-for-liam-coen-in-tampa/|Door Should Still Be Open For Liam Coen In Tampa|Updated 11:15 p.m.: Egos don’t win football games. (UPDATE: Liam Coen will be the next Jaguars head coach. The Bucs’ door is closed.) Yes, it appears Liam Coen pulled a low-class snake move on the Bucs by taking a second interview for the Jacksonville head coaching gig today when he told the Bucs he wouldn’t. He may get the Jags job. He may not. The Jags still have more interviews to conduct. Bucs fans are pissed off. So is Joe. But Joe thinks some fans should dial back their Coen rage that has them completely writing off Coen whether he gets the Jacksonville job or not. Joe sure hopes the folks at One Buc Palace aren’t taking that approach. Coen is the best offensive coordinator for the 2025 Bucs. If there’s a way to keep him in the job next season, it has to be done. Team Glazer and Jason Licht can hold their nose if they have to, but if the Bucs are serious about winning, the Coen has to remain the priority until he’s unavailable. Tom Brady himself tried to leave the Bucs after the 2021 season when he was under a Bucs contract in a shady deal with the Dolphins that brought massive NFL sanctions. The Bucs acted like it never happened and brought Brady back the following season. Joe’s not claiming Coen is Tom Brady, but the value to the offense the offense in the respective seasons in comparable. Joe gets the fan rage at Coen, but rest assured, not one player (well, maybe one) on the Bucs offense is going to care that Coen tried to get a fat bag in Jacksonville but came up short.|2025-01-23 20:40:00|281|63|2|Liam Coen|Coen's actions spark controversy among Buccaneers fans and management.|2|Mixed sentiment with negative tones, concerns about character, and loyalty issues raised.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Uhhmm"", ""post"": ""Reminds me of Brady and the Dolphins a bit\u2026\u2026"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""23rd,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""8:42"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""#99 the big fella"", ""post"": ""They better figure out a way to keep him.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/gerald-mccoy-as-buccaneers-d-line-coach/|Gerald McCoy As Buccaneers D-Line Coach?|With assistant coach Kacy Rodgers bailing to the Bucs’ defensive line room for the warm sunny skies of Detroit, an opening is now on Todd Bowles’ staff — perhaps for a man who’s coached up his share of Bucs defensive lineman.  Six-time Buccaneers Pro Bowl defensive tackle Gerald McCoy has always loved working with young players, Vita Vea included, and he’s a friend of Todd Bowles and is on good terms with the important folks at One Buc Palace. McCoy was seen working with Calijah Kancey this summer. And he was seen on social media today implying that he’d be interested in filling Rodgers’ shoes. Joe loves this idea. McCoy turns 37 soon and would be a high-energy, devoted teacher bringing very diverse experience. Remember, McCoy played for several defensive line coaches in Tampa and was with the Panthers, Raiders and Cowboys after leaving the Bucs. Perhaps Bowles could consider pairing McCoy with another D-line coach for a one-year trial shot of teaching and juice. Joe is sure if McCoy were to take the gig, he’d be 100 percent committed.|2025-01-23 20:27:00|180|45|6|Gerald McCoy|McCoy possibly joining Bucs as D-line coach.|4|Mixed feelings on hiring Sapp or McCoy.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/albert-breer-liam-coen-already-violated-terms-of-proposed-contract/|Albert Breer: Liam Coen Already Violated Term Of Proposed Contract|With the news that Mr. Clean, Robert Saleh, is now in Jacksonville to interview with the Jags, one way or the other, Liam Coen’s days with the Bucs may be over. That’s the word from Albert Breer of SI.com. Few if any reporters are more plugged-in than Breer in NFL circles. And Breer Twittered out Thursday night that there was one major stipulation in the proposal by the Bucs to make Coen the highest-paid offensive coordinator in the NFL. If Coen had a second interview with the Jags, the contract offer was null and void and pulled off the table. It almost sounds like someone in Jacksonville leaked this intel to Pearl Harbor Coen’s chances of returning to the Bucs, making it virtually a done deal that Coen would stay in Jacksonville.|2025-01-23 19:48:00|132|95|3|Liam Coen|Coen may leave Bucs for Jacksonville after contract violation.|3|Mixed sentiment, leaning slightly towards pessimism.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Richard Dickson"", ""post"": ""Did he honestly think the Bucs wouldn\u2019t find out about the second interview if he didn\u2019t get the job and came back to Tampa??"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""23rd,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""7:49"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Simeon4HOF"", ""post"": ""Jacksonville wanna go to war or what"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""23rd,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""7:49"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""StormyInFl"", ""post"": ""Frank Reich or Doug Pederson on line 1\u2026."", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""23rd,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""7:50"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter3"": {""username"": ""Simeon4HOF"", ""post"": ""Somethings fishy goin on"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""23rd,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""7:51"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter4"": {""username"": ""Simeon4HOF"", ""post"": ""NFL should step in and blow up the whole deal at this point.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/jordan-schultz-liam-coens-chance-to-reach-his-dream-may-have-won-out/|Jordan Schultz: Liam Coen’s Chance To Reach His Dream May Have Won Out|Joe has learned when it comes to Liam Coen, unless and until the Jags officially announce he’s their new head coach, there’s a chance he isn’t. FOX NFL insider Jordan Schultz, just before his appearance on “Speak for Yourself” seen weekdays on FS1, got off the phone or text chain with his contacts with the Bucs and Jags and had background info on the Coen drama between the Bucs (former?) offensive coordinator, and maybe Jags head coach. Apparently, after Coen told the Jags thanks but no thanks yesterday, Jags owner Shad Con Khan aggressively stalked and hounded Coen to get him to change his mind. Schultz noted that Coen had a helluva setup in Tampa. Winning team. Maybe a Super Bowl team next fall. Loads of Team Glazer loot and his close relationship with Todd Bowles and Baker Mayfield. As Coen said in his last press conference with the local pen and mic club, his dream was to be an NFL head coach. Now he had a chance with a former No. 1 overall pick at quarterback (like Mayfield), a decent running back and a special rookie receiver. What changed Coen’s mind? Trent Baalke. The former Jags general manager was fired by Khan the moment Coen told the Jags no. Schultz said now, Coen could have a chance to hire the general manager of his choosing, which of course could buy him years of job security. Think about it: Khan was ready to hang on to Urban Meyer and Baalke until it became impossible to retain their services. And years of job security means millions and millions of dollars. You can see and hear Schultz describe what happened with Coen yesterday and today in the FS1 video below.  |2025-01-23 19:27:00|288|21|3|Liam Coen|Coen's NFL head coach dream may become reality.|0|Pessimism and anger directed towards coach leaving for another team.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Aj"", ""post"": ""bum (no class)"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""23rd,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""7:30"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""M Core"", ""post"": ""And now we will have the real Lovie Bowles stand up and give us a sub .500 season and then he\u2019ll be fired."", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""23rd,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""7:32"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""Benedict Coen"", ""post"": ""Absolute scum.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/cbs-liam-coens-agreement-with-bucs-meant-nothing/|CBS: Liam Coen’s Agreement With Bucs Meant Nothing|Very good point made by the top dog of NFL news for CBS. Jonathan Jones took to Twitter a short while ago and, with Bucs fans (and apparently the Bucs, too) outraged that (former ?) Bucs offensive coordinator Liam Coen apparently reneged on a deal to return to Tampa to be one of the game’s highest offensive coordinators, Jones put this issue in proper perspective. The agreement doesn’t mean jack. @jjones9: Coen’s deal with Tampa is unsigned but even if it were signed, it’s my understanding that still wouldn’t prevent him from entertaining the Jaguars and ultimately taking a deal to be their head coach. Joe made that point earlier. Coordinator contracts can’t prevent a guy from leaving for a promotion. Now the contract could have been written that included substantial penalties if the contract were broken, or broken early. But that doesn’t prevent the owner of a new club from cutting the new coach a signing bonus to pay the penaties. So in the big picture, Coen’s contract is just a talking point, a distraction. It’s pretty clear to Joe that this “agreement” was used by Coen as leverage to get the general manager he wanted in Jacksonville.  |2025-01-23 18:50:00|199|88|6|Liam Coen|Coen leveraged agreement with Bucs for desired GM in Jacksonville.|4|Mixed sentiments with disappointment and frustration over Coen's departure and pessimism regarding future coaching decisions.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""ReenYeing"", ""post"": ""Don\u2019t care that he did it, just care how he did it.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/bucs-thought-they-had-an-agreement-with-liam-coen/|Bucs Thought They Had An Agreement With Liam Coen|This is pretty wild. Someone with the Bucs is talking. And he or she is reaching out to the national guys. And whoever is doing the talking is clearly p!ssed. It seems, by way of Diana Russini of The Athletic, the Bucs thought they had Coen back with the team in the fold. Per Russini’s contact, the Bucs thought they had an agreement with Coen to return as offensive coordinator. Instead, Coen headed to Jacksonville and is in the process of negotiating a contract to be the Jags’ next coach. So it appears Coen played both sides of the fence. Hey, he likely came out the winner, so Joe guesses props to him. But that’s kind of shady to say, yeah, I will come back and then just use the Bucs as a fallback plan if he couldn’t get the Jags job. Guess the next time, you better get a pen on paper before the guy walks away (for good). And, of course, pen on paper doesn’t mean much in the NFL coaching world.|2025-01-23 18:33:00|174|77|6|Liam Coen|Bucs thought they had agreement|1|Pessimism and disappointment towards Coen leaving Bucs for Jags, questioning loyalty and leadership.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Steven #55"", ""post"": ""Classless"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""23rd,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""6:36"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Brian"", ""post"": ""Can\u2019t wait to see him get fired after 2-3 years.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/bucs-couldnt-reach-liam-coen/|Bucs Couldn’t Reach Liam Coen|Joe has no idea what happened and won’t try to interpret what this means, but it is newsworthy. Apparently, per Adam Schefter of ESPN, the Bucs tried to reach out to (former?) Bucs offensive coordinator Liam Coen today. What the purpose was of the attempting was, Joe won’t speculate. But the Bucs could not reach him. @AdamSchefter: Buccaneers have had no contact today with Liam Coen or his representation. The team has made multiple efforts to reach him and has not. Coen is in Jacksonville discussing a deal to become the head coach. Does this simply mean Coen was too involved in talks with the Jags to respond? Your guess is as good as Joe’s. A sad, sad day for the Bucs. The second-best offensive coordinator the Bucs had (second only to Bucco Bruce Arians) is nearly gone. Joe knows the defense better step up in 2025 because Joe fears without Coen pulling the levers for the offense, it won’t be any better than it was this past season.

Frank Frangie is the afternoon drive time voice on 92.5 FM sports radio in Jacksonville (something Joe has spent way too much time listening to lately). Frangie also is the Jaguars’ radio play-by-play man. Today, Frangie’s show was an ear-popping experience for any Bucs fan tuned in. Frangie said the Jaguars-Liam Coen dance for their vacant head coaching job is not over. Adam Schefter reported Tuesday that Coen would stay in Tampa as offensive coordinator and turn down his second interview for the head coach gig in Jacksonville scheduled for Wednesday. Then the Jaguars fired general manager Trent Baalke hours later and resumed pursuing Coen. “The Jags obviously made a run back at [Coen],” Frangie said. “I think that’s probably widely known in the football world,” Frangie said. “What happened from that point forward, I don’t know. What I do know is at 4:22 p.m. on Thursday, there’s still no announcement [from the Bucs] that Coen has signed [a new contract with Tampa Bay]. … “I will tell you, [Coen] is torn. I can tell you there’s a lot of things at play here.” Frangie specifically noted his “sources” are “good,” and he shared very unique tidbits on Coen, such as claiming Coen’s wedding anniversary was Tuesday night or Wednesday. Frangie also said Seahawks offensive assistant coach Jake Peetz is Coen’s best friend and is eager to be reunited in Jacksonville with Coen. (Frangie even apologized to Peetz on-air in case Frangie crossed a line by making that comment). Peetz was a scout in Jacksonville for four seasons before moving into an offensive assistant coach role there in 2012. He worked with Coen on the Rams’ staff (2022). They’re the same age and Frangie said Coen likely would bring Peetz with him to Jacksonville as offensive coordinator. To steal Frangie’s line of thinking, Joe will note it’s 5:35 p.m. and there’s still no official announcement of Coen’s new contract from the Buccaneers.|2025-01-23 17:36:00|330|28|7|Liam Coen|Jaguars pursued Coen for head coach|4|Speculation, drama, uncertainty, mixed reactions, some negativity towards Coen and the organization.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""BallHawk75"", ""post"": ""Perhaps the reason the defensive coaches are bolting is because Bowles is about to get canned so Coen can stay on as HC,"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""23rd,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""5:46"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""BallHawk75"", ""post"": ""Then bring father Dungy back as the DC!!!!"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""23rd,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""5:49"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""Durango 95"", ""post"": ""Bucs have always made it a point to not announce signings until the time it was actually signed.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/lions-to-interview-larry-foote/|Lions To Interview Larry Foote|It sure smells like the Bucs will have new defensive coaches for the 2025 season. FOX NFL insider Jordan Schultz reports the Lions will interview Bucs inside linebackers coach Larry Foote for their open defensive coordinator position. With Kacy Rodgers already gone and apparently with Foote having one foot out the door, that tells Joe there will be multiple new defensive staff members. And Joe doesn’t think that is unwarranted. When your defense doesn’t force one punt in a playoff game (yes, Joe knows it forced two turnovers on downs) people need to take a serious look at why that was. Now what Joe wonders is, will the Bucs have Todd Bowles name someone else as defensive coordinator?

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/liam-coen-cant-lose/|Liam Coen “Can’t Lose”|Bucs offensive coordinator Liam Coen may have made the smartest move of the 2025 coaching cycle. Who said that? Why the football sophist we all love by way of CBS. And that would be prickly Pete Prisco. When Prisco learned Coen pulled his name out of the running for the Jaguars head coaching gig and instead agreed to a new contract with the Bucs, Prisco took to Twitter to talk about Cown pulling the plug on his second interview with the Jags. Prisco, who is based in Jacksonville, was impressed by how Coen played this all out. Coen at least appeared “this close” to taking the Jags job when Team Glazer swooped in with a new contract. And in the process, Coen set himself up with a good job for 2026 no matter what happens, Prisco believes. @PriscoCBS: Coen can’t lose. If the Bucs are good and the offense is again good, he can go somewhere next year. If the team stinks, he will almost certainly take over as coach. Whoa! So Prisco believes Bucs coach Todd Bowles is on the hot seat already and that Team Glazer would simply promote Coen to take over for Bowles? Then that prompts more questions. What keeps Bowles in his job after this season, a winning record? Another division title? A playoff win? What if the Bucs win the division with eight wins like Bowles did in 2022?

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/todd-bowles-bill-parcells-and-rushing-differential/|Todd Bowles, Bill Parcells And Rushing Differential|So head coach Todd Bowles is a stop-the-run guy and the Bucs’ run defense is very good. He also wants to run the ball well — and often. Fresh insight into that Bowles’ philosophy has emerged. Bucs defensive line coach Kacy Rodgers (thought he’s is interviewing with the Packers for the same job) has long been by Bowles’ side but is not from the Bucco Bruce Arians coaching farm. Rodgers was a defensive line coach for Hall of Fame head coach Bill Parcells with the Cowboys in 2003. Two years later, Bowles joined the staff. A few years ago, Parcells talked about Bowles taking the Buccaneers’ head coaching gig and called him one his “homeboys.” So Joe thinks it’s fair to say some Parcells principles are part of the approach at One Buc Palace. Rodgers spoke on the Buccaneers Radio Network last week and referenced a Parcells formula to get a 7-point edge on an opponent: outrush the other team by 100 yards. The Bucs accomplished that six times this season and were 5-1 in those games. The only loss came at Dallas. The Bucs outrushed the Cowboys 134 yards to 31 yards but allowed backup quarterback Cooper Rush to carve up their soft, soft pass defense. In the end, of course, that loss didn’t hurt the Bucs and had no bearing on their No. 3 seed in the NFC.|2025-01-23 09:43:00|230|17|7|Todd Bowles|Philosophy influenced by Bill Parcells|4|Mixed sentiments on team performance and coaching decisions with some negativity and defensiveness.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Buddha"", ""post"": ""That is how the Eagles win."", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""23rd,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""9:51"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""PSL Bob"", ""post"": ""So, you\u2019re telling me if we had a pass defense comparable to our run defense we might win more games?"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""23rd,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""9:57"", ""am""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""Buchen61"", ""post"": ""The glorification of Todd Bowles continues\u2026 Smh"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""23rd,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""10:25"", ""am""]}, ""commenter3"": {""username"": ""Buchen61"", ""post"": ""I heard Todd Bowles and Vince Lombardi both loved spaghetti\u2026 Could be something there"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""23rd,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""10:28"", ""am""]}, ""commenter4"": {""username"": ""JimBobBuc"", ""post"": ""HOF coach Parcells was in a different era with different NFL rules for protecting QB\u2019s and WR\u2019s."", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""23rd,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""10:35"", ""am""]}, ""commenter5"": {""username"": ""Lt.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/chatter-that-liam-coen-wasnt-getting-jaguars-job/|Chatter That Liam Coen Wasn’t Getting Jaguars Job|One of the high priests of NFL insiders shared a different take on Bucs offensive coordinator Liam Coen removing himself from the Jaguars’ head coaching search. NBC Sports insider and ProFootballTalk.com founder Mike Florio talked about the Coen retention today and dropped this interesting nugget. “Somebody yesterday who has got some knowledge of the search said that Coen pulled his name out because he wasn’t going to get it,” Florio said via NFL on NBC’s YouTube channel. “That’s usually what prompts someone to pull their name out.” Florio went on to acknowledge that on the surface, it appears Coen may have been a top Jaguars candidate because of how the Jags organization fired their general manager, Trent Baalke, hours after Coen pulled the plug. “It looks like Coen pulls out because of Baalke so they fire Baalke,” Florio said, noting the logic of the timeline but without necessarily buying it. Florio also added that Coen may have gotten a Coach-in-waiting promise in writing from the Bucs and the team is completely free to lie about what it did or did not give Coen. Multiple unsourced reports have claimed the Bucs gave Coen no such promise. Joe puts limited stock in unsourced reports, which helps make following the NFL so much fun.|2025-01-23 07:10:00|211|56|6|Liam Coen|Coen's withdrawal from Jaguars job speculation and coach-in-waiting rumor.|3|Mixed opinions, skepticism, and conflicting information regarding coaching speculation and team dynamics.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Couch Fan"", ""post"": ""Like I said yesterday if there was a promise made, they would do everything possible to not let it come out.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/the-man-who-led-the-charge-to-keep-liam-coen/|The Man Who Led The Charge To Keep Liam Coen|This might rattle the cages of the “Fire Bowles; Promote Coen” crowd, or those already hatching plans for ways to nudge Team Glazer to can Todd Bowles a year from now. From the fingertips of FOX NFL insider Jordan Schultz, the man inside One Buc Palace who hounded Bucs AC/DC-loving general manager Jason Licht and Team Glazer to find a way to keep Coen was the very same person who hounded Licht to sign Baker Mayfield two years ago. That would be Bowles. Bowles aggressively worked behind the scenes with Team Glazer and Licht to find a way, so Coen didn’t bolt for the first head coaching offer available. When Coen landed a second interview with the Jags, Team Glazer, checkbook in hand, pounced off the top rope Randy “Macho Man” Savage style with Elizabeth (Licht) watching ringside. So for those who want to run Bowles for having the nerve to win 10 games, the very reason many fans are hung over today from partying last night because Coen stayed with the Bucs, it was Bowles himself who helped make sure that Coen was taken care of.|2025-01-23 06:20:00|187|78|4|Todd Bowles|Bowles ensured Liam Coen stayed with Bucs through efforts.|3|Mixed sentiments with concerns about Bowles' performance and praise for Coen's impact.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""OHBucFan"", ""post"": ""Classy guy.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/e-j-speed-and-the-bucs/|E.J. Speed And The Bucs|Joe’s got the calendar alarm set. At noon on March 10, the 2025 NFL free agency frenzy begins. That’s when teams can talk to pending free agents not on their roster, and agree to deals that can be consummated on March 12. By the night of the 10th, dozens of players will have new teams. The reports will be flowing from Adam Schefter, Ian Rapoport and other multi-millionaire media friends who get rewarded with the news because their organizations have massive financial ties the league. It’s a glorious day. This year, Buccaneers Ring of Honor general manager Jason Licht gets to play in that expensive sandbox. The Bucs have salary cap room for a change (not a lot), a limited number of in-house free agents to retain, and the ability to craft more cap room with re-negotiated deals to guys like Mike Evans, Tristan Wirfs and more. So where will the Bucs look to fortify their roster with an experienced player? That’s unclear, but Joe is somewhat confident the Bucs will be chasing an inside linebacker, regardless of what Lavonte David decides. Might that be Colts tackle machine E.J. Speed? Speed is an interesting cat, the No. 2 linebacker in Indianapolis alongside NFL tackles leader and Pro Bowler Zaire Franklin. Speed turns 30 in June but he has very low mileage on his body. The six-year veteran barely played on defense in his first four seasons when he was known as one of the NFL’s best special teams players. He got to start in 2023 and made the most of it with 102 combined tackles in that season and 142 last year. The 2019 fifth-round pick out of the Division II ranks won’t be confused with a Pro Bowler, but he can play, and he can cover better than K.J. Britt the PFF Tribe will have you believe. Joe can’t see Speed commanding a ton of money after completing a two-year, $8 million deal. Perhaps this is a guy Todd Bowles feels he can get more out of? One interesting red flag on Speed is his podcast with Franklin. It’s R-rated and has generated some controversy, not the kind of thing that fits into Licht’s version of a Buccaneer man. But maybe the podcast ends when/if Speed leaves the Colts.|2025-01-23 06:00:00|380|27|5|E.J.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/cbs-jags-pursuit-of-liam-coen-isnt-over-yet/|CBS: Jags’ Pursuit Of Liam Coen Isn’t Over (Yet)|If someone told Joe that Bucs fans lit fireworks in the cold of yesterday morning after word got out that Bucs offensive coordinator Liam Coen was staying, Joe wouldn’t be one bit surprised. Joe can never remember a Bucs assistant flirting with another team that had almost every Bucs fan on two feet about to freak out. Oh, there was anxiety and hand-wringing when Mike Smith about about to bolt the Bucs for another job after the 2016 season. Team Glazer also came swooping in and made it worth Smith’s time not to pursue a head coaching gig, just like they did Coen yesterday. (Joe has heard the deal was in the works for days.) But the near-freakout was nowhere near the level of Bucs fans yesterday. Thankfully, it all worked out. But did it? Jonathan Jones is of the mind that the Jags will take another run at Coen. Probably with more loot, and maybe with an opportunity to pick his general manager. That’s because after Coen told Jags owner Shad Con Khan, thanks but no thanks, Khan realized he missed out on both Ben Johnson and Coen because nobody wants to work with Jags general manager Trent Baalke. That is former Jags general manager Trent Baalke. After Coen rebuffed Khan, then Khan canned Baalke. Jones of CBS has a hunch Khan will take another run at Coen with Baalke out of the way. @jjones9: With Baalke out and knowing how interested the franchise has been in Liam Coen, it would not be shocking to see the Jaguars make another run at the Buccaneers offensive coordinator. They make him tell them no twice. Well, as Joe typed earlier, Coen knows the Jags are a trainwreck of a franchise compared to the Bucs. If Coen plays his cards right, he could be coaching Arch Manning in a year or two somewhere and be set for a decade or longer.  |2025-01-23 03:45:00|319|33|4|Liam Coen|Jags may pursue Coen again due to franchise issues.|3|Various opinions and uncertainties about Liam Coen's future as a coach.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Hodad"", ""post"": ""When asked earlier in the year about getting a HC job Coen indicated that\u2019s the plan, but he was having fun here, and was in no hurry.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/did-trevor-lawrence-spook-liam-coen/|Did Trevor Lawrence Spook Liam Coen?|So this is weird: A couple of guys on Mike Greenberg’s podcast were talking NFL, including Bucs offensive coordinator Liam Coen, but Greenberg wasn’t on his own podcast. Strange. Anyway,Coen’s decision yesterday to throw in the towel on the Jags and instead stay with the Bucs seemed to trigger someone named Qiant Myers. And Myers already has a culprit for the breakdown in the Jags’ pursuit of Coen. That would be Jags quarterback Trevor Lawrence. But Myers can’t believe Coen chose Baker Mayfield over Lawrence. “I’m old enough to remember a time, because I was more than five years old, in which Trevor Lawrence was supposed to be the next John Elway. He was supposed to be the best prospect since Andrew Luck. “What the bleep happened? I cannot imagine a scenario, I could not imagine a scenario, in which Trevor Lawrence, who was anointed, who was the chosen one, who was going to be the messiah of Jacksonville, [that a coach] would have had a job opportunity available to coach him this early in his career. “And a coordinator given the opportunity to do that pulling his name out of the running to coordinate an offense quarterbacked by Baker Mayfield instead.” That’s kind of harsh. Mayfield is one of the better quarterbacks in the league. He’s certainly better than Lawrence. And sadly, Joe fears that inept outfit in Jacksonville screwed up Lawrence for good when they stuck him as a rookie with an option quarterback guy who actually thought Dwayne Haskins was a better quarterback than Joe Burrow. Yes, that would be Urban Meyer. Lawrence was never the same. Coen bet on himself yesterday (with Team Glazer loot, of course). Coen figures more jobs will open up where the organization in question will have an idea or a clue to what they are doing unlike the modern-day Bill Bidwill, Jags owner Shad Con Khan. By betting on himself, if Coen plays his cards right, he could be coaching Arch Manning somewhere in a year or two. Y ou really think the Manning Clan will let Arch Manning go to some Mickey Mouse outfit like the Jags (that plays home games in London each year) That’s why they wouldn’t let Eli Manning sign with the Chargers 20 years ago — the Manning Clan thought the Spanos Gang was over its head.|2025-01-23 00:00:00|391|22|4|Trevor Lawrence|Turmoil surrounding Liam Coen's coaching decision and criticism of Lawrence.|2|Mixed sentiment with some negativity and skepticism towards certain coaching decisions.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Cometowin2"", ""post"": ""Just glad Liam is back for 2025.
