https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/todd-bowles-already-sending-message-to-his-players/|Todd Bowles Already Sending Message To His Players|Joe has mentioned the following a few times already because Joe thinks it is so profound. We all know Todd Bowles is a laid-back kind of guy. Doesn’t mean he isn’t passionate about winning, he’s just not a cartoon character on the sidelines. So when he gets visibly upset — a very rare occurrence — you can bet that whatever has ticked him off is big. After watching his defense pretend they were playing a game in a Pasco County high school flag football summer league and getting roasted like a hog on a tailgate grill, Bowles, in his customary halftime spot on the Buccaneers Radio Network, blurted, “DB’s have to get their heads out of their asses.” For Bowles, that was a Parcellsian explosion. Of course, the Bucs defense played significantly better in the second half yesterday, even without starting corner Jamel Dean who was hurt (again). Maybe thinking he has to get ahead of things for this Sunday’s game given the magnitude of the stakes — win and the Bucs are in the playoffs — Bowles already began harping on fundamentals in his day-after presser this afternoon. “They have to do the little things right,” Bowles said of what he expects in Sunday’s game against the slimy Saints. “They shouldn’t respond any other way than they responded yesterday. “We have to do the little things right. It’s a division opponent, we know it’s going to be a dogfight. We had to win one last year – last game of the season [at Carolina], it was 9-0. It was a dog fight with Carolina so we expect the same thing.” Well, the Bucs offense is a bit different than last year’s Stinking Panthers. The Bucs have a dominating run game. Last year there was nothing remotely dominating about it. And, as the age-old football saying goes, a run game will open up the pass game. And Baker Mayfield is a hot quarterback right now.|2024-12-30 15:05:00|325|72|7|Todd Bowles|Bowles urges team focus and improvement for playoffs contention.|5|Mixed opinions on Todd Bowles, defense, and past players' impact on the team.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Matt_PcAfee"", ""post"": ""Joe any update on Pro Bowl voting?"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""30th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""3:12"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Upstate NY BUC"", ""post"": ""Just take the ball first Sunday, should be no prob!!!!

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/confident-baker-mayfield-top-5-qb/|Confident Baker Mayfield = Top-5 QB|Baker Mayfield has fired 39 touchdown passes this season. Consider that no NFL QB hit that total in 2023 and only one got there in 2022. His success this season somehow doesn’t feel as special as it really is because Mayfield isn’t considered one of the NFL’s glamour quarterbacks. You know the names. They’re the guys the national media slobbers over. Only Joe Burrow has more TD throws than Mayfield this season (42), and a couple of ex-QB analysts were showing the love today after Mayfield’s five-touchdown outing yesterday. Dan Orlovsky was barking on ESPN’s “First Dump” about how when Mayfield is playing confidently like he has been recently, the result is top-5 quarterback play. “He just cuts it, man,” the former Bucs QB ranted. NBC guru Chris Simms, another ex-Bucs QB, noted how Mayfield throwing fastball after fastball fearlessly is very impressive and speaks to his confidence in the players around him. Mayfield isn’t throwing to a special receiving/tight ends group since Chris Godwin went down injured, Orlovsky added, agreeing with his co-host’s notion that Mayfield has the quietest 39 touchdown passes in NFL history. Joe hopes Mayfield keeps getting left out of most star quarterback discussions. It seems to motivate him.|2024-12-30 13:19:00|203|83|7|Baker Mayfield|Top-5 QB with quiet success and motivation.|5|Mixed opinions about Mayfield, some skepticism, some support for his abilities and potential success.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""stone crab sam"", ""post"": ""And to think the bucs got him for 100 mill. 3 years.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/the-steal-of-the-draft/|“The Steal Of The Draft”| Man, Joe loves how Bucky Irving love is finally flowing effortlessly inside One Buc Palace. Earlier this season, it felt like a lot of players and Bucs decision-makers were mindful not to throw too much love at Irving to protect fellow running back Rachaad White’s feelings. Irving got his second start of the season yesterday and his prior start only came because White missed a game injured. Todd Bowles’ postgame comments were simple regarding the decision: “Bucky was playing better,” he said. Collectively, Bucs fans could be heard screaming: “That’s been obvious for months, Coach!” No huge deal. Irving has 44 more carries than White this season, so Irving was getting plenty of action already. But Joe is glad the team formally has come around to hanging the bellcow on Irving. Consider how ESPN insider Jeff Darlington went on record with the Bucs’ new gameplan before yesterday’s game in his report from The Licht House. And then there was Buccaneers legend Mike Evans saying Irving was “the steal of the draft” after the game. Joe will agree with Evans, considering Irving was a fourth-round pick. Does Irving ever have a bad game? In addition to his 1,033 rushing yards on only 188 carries, Irving leads the NFL in catch percentage (45 of 47) and is averaging an impressive 8.8 yards per catch, which bests White’s strong season receiving last year. As Joe has noted, it appears the Buccaneers control the “Buckyneers.com” internet domain and are pointing it to their official website. If Irving can keep rolling, Team Glazer might have to consider going all-in and blowing out Buckyneers merch. Embrace all things Bucky.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/slimy-saints-offense-just-what-ailing-bucs-defense-needs/|Slimy Saints Offense Just What Ailing Bucs Defense Needs|How bad was it yesterday in the first half? Bad enough to get Bucs coach Todd Bowles mad. The Bucs’ pass defense in the first half was so wretched, Joe thought it was a flag football game. Pasco County high schools used to have a summer flag league for the schools’ football teams that Joe used to attend, and Joe swore that was what the Bucs defense looked like yesterday. Stinking Panthers receivers, specifically Adam Thielen, were running wild and free through the Bucs’ secondary. It was absolutely shameful! The duck could have guarded Carolina receivers just as well. It was right on par with watching the Bucs under Mike Smith try to guard Julio Jones with Ryan Smith. Bowles was so angry that on the Buccaneers Radio Network in his customary remarks heading to the locker room, Bowles said, “DB’s have to get their heads out of their asses.” Whoa! That was (and is) so out of character for Bowles. Man, he must have been about to erupt. Given the gravity of yesterday’s game, Joe understood the frustration. So here come the slimy Saints marching into The Licht House on Sunday in a win-and-in game for Tampa Bay. A win for the Bucs means the NFC South title and hosting a playoff game. And it seems the ailing Bucs defense, which saw cornerback Jamel Dean hurt (again), will get a break the way the slimy Saints offense is playing of late, documents Jeffri Chadiha of NFL.com. Given that the Saints have suffered three straight losses and scored a combined 29 points in those contests, it’s hard not to like Tampa Bay’s chances next Sunday. This is just what the Bucs need: An impotent passing offense for their shaky (to be polite) defense to slow down (forget stop). This ought to be a fun week leading up to Sunday’s win-and-in game. And Sunday should be loads of fun.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/buccaneers-run-game-is-best-in-team-history/|Buccaneers’ Run Game Is Best In Team History|Some ancient Bucs fans of the 1979 team might be a little annoyed by the following: The current Bucs have 2,357 yards rushing through 16 games. That’s the highest total in Tampa Bay since ’79, when the Bucs gained 2,437 yards on the ground in their 16-game season. But by NFL standards 45 years ago, that was only an above-average rushing attack. Those ’79 Bucs averaged 4.0 yards per carry, which ranked 14th in the NFL. Today’s Bucs rank third in yards per carry at (5.2 yards) and have the fourth-most rushing yards in the league. So Joe is calling it today. Bucky Irving, Rachaad White, the beastly Bucs offensive line and friends are the greatest rushing attack in the history of the franchise. It’s that good. Team Glazer has commissioned a documentary on the history of the franchise to be released near the start of the Bucs’ 50th season next year.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/no-3-seed-in-play/|No. 3 Seed In Play|While securing the No. 3 seed in the NFC playoffs would come with potential advantages for Tampa Bay, the No. 4 seed would, too. So the Rams (10-6) officially won the NFC West last night. No matter what happens Sunday, the Rams own the tiebreaker edge on Seattle (9-7). The Rams hold the No. 3 playoff seed but could lose it to the Bucs (9-7) if Los Angeles falls to Arizona on Sunday and the Bucs beat the slimy Saints. But do the Bucs want the No. 3 seed? That would set up Tampa Bay to host Green Bay or Washington on wild card weekend. Considering the Lions and Vikings, each 14-2, will battle to the death for the No. 1 overall seed on Sunday night, Joe thinks it could be advantageous for the Bucs, as the No. 4 seed, to host the loser of that game. The loser would become the No. 5 seed and have less rest and presumably more wear and tear than Washington or Green Bay. Regardless, the Bucs only want a ticket to the dance, and it probably makes a lot more sense to be the No. 3 seed, which comes with a higher chance of hosting the NFC Championship game.|2024-12-30 09:59:00|206|36|7|No. 3 Seed|NFC playoff seed scenarios and potential advantages discussed.|1|Mixed sentiments with cautious optimism.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""MadMax"", ""post"": ""We\u2019re nothing\u2026.keep getting beat by bad teams, win against the good ones, except yesterday\u2026.where does that drunken craziness end?

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/tone-setter-calijah-kancey/|Tone-Setter Calijah Kancey|Sack No. 7 1/2 came early yesterday for defensive tackle Calijah Kancey. He leads the team in that department but Joe likes how Kancey’s takedowns often set a tone and aren’t in garbage time. While the Bucs blew out the Panthers yesterday 48-14, it’s easy to forget this was a close game early. With 25 seconds remaining in the first quarter, the Bucs led 10-7 and Carolina had the ball: 3rd-and-9 and their 31 yard line. Kancey lined up on the left edge, stunted inside and used his blur-like explosiveness to drop quarterback Bryce Young (video below). The first sack of the Bucs’ five-sack day. Those kinds of early hits get in a quarterback’s head and can prove so important. Kancey missed five games with a calf issue but leads the team tackles for loss, sacks and quarterback hits.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/tristan-wirfs-raves-about-the-bucs-run-game/|Tristan Wirfs Raves About Bucs’ Run Game|Nothing seems to make offensive linemen happier than a good running game. Well, except for cold beer and hot steaks. The Bucs bulldozed the Stinking Panthers on the ground yesterday, racking up 202 yards on 40 carries, a hair over five yards a carry. Tristan Wirfs may have been most proud of Bucky Irving surpassing 1,000 yards rushing. Irving became the first Bucs rookie to put up those kinds of numbers since Doug Martin in 2012. “That was awesome,” Wirfs said of Irving’s feat. “We knew he was close, and we definitely wanted to get that for him because that’s huge.” Wirfs then noted how Rachaad White and even Sean Tucker contributed big runs. In short, Wirfs is very proud. “That was a statement run from him,” Wirfs said of a 16-yard run by White. “Then ‘Tuck’ [Sean Tucker] comes in and he gets stopped in the backfield, does a little spin thing and gets positive yards out of it. “We have three great [running] backs back there who we have all the faith in the world in and they’re going to go out and do their job when they need to.” The old football adage about having a good run game in the playoffs may pay off for the Bucs. That is, if they arrive to playoff games p!ssed off like the offense was yesterday.|2024-12-30 09:00:00|226|23|8|Tristan Wirfs|Bucs linemen proud of strong run game performance.|5|Mixed sentiments on offense, defense, coaching, upcoming games, and player performance.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""TheBucsAnthem"", ""post"": ""I think this the BEST offensive line I\u2019ve ever seen in Tampa Bay Buccaneers history\u2026..yes, even better than Brady\u2019s Superbowl season."", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""30th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""9:05"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""pewter941"", ""post"": ""Looked great now that White finally got benched for fumbling.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/baker-mayfield-and-pat-mahomes/|Baker Mayfield And Pat Mahomes|This is the first time Joe can recall Baker Mayfield and star Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes linked outside of the mentions that they both played for Kliff Kingsbury at Texas Tech. (Mayfield later transferred to Oklahoma where he played for Bob Stoops and Lincoln Riley). Well, NextGen Stats shows Mayfield pulled off something yesterday that hasn’t been seen since it was pulled off by Mahomes, arguably the best quarterback in the league. Simply put, if yesterday was the real Mayfield, Joe hopes teams blitz him. Why? Mayfield completed all 12 passes against a blitz, which also included all five of his touchdown throws. Those five TD passes against the blitz are the most since Mahomes in Week 1 of the 2022 season. If you do something great that hasn’t happened since Mahomes climbed the same mountain, Joe thinks you’ve landed in elite company.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/five-things-84/|Five Things|Happy Victory Monday! Fun game yesterday. But Joe senses Bucs fans couldn’t fully let loose with robust hilarity and emotion because they were on pins and needles over the Dixie Chicks game late last night. But everything turned out fine. So grab your mug of coffee and let’s roll! Win and In Yes! The Commandos made Bucs fans sweat gallons of perspiration last night. Joe got a text from a hardcore Bucs fan who mocked the Dixie Chicks, typing “Good thing Atlanta’s defense is worse than the Bucs’.” With the score Atlanta 17, Washington 14 in the third quarter, Joe replied to the text, “Not bad enough.” Joe just wanted to barf when Kyle Pitts hung on to an absolute rope of a pass from Dixie Chicks rookie QB Michael Penix. (Who is laughing at Atlanta for drafting Penix now?). But one of the best clutch quarterbacks in the league, fellow rookie Jayden Daniels, once again pulled out a win in the final minutes or overtime. Next time Joe is in our nation’s capital, Daniels’ beers are on Joe’s tab. So what does this all mean? Very simple: Win and in. If the Bucs win Sunday against the slimy Saints (1 p.m. kickoff at The Licht House), Tampa Bay will win the NFC South and host a playoff game (again) two weeks from now in the wild card round. Yes, Joe has vivid, haunting memories of The Lost Decade, so while Joe was typing “again” in regards to hosting a playoff game, Joe had the shivers thinking about how surreal that would have sounded just five years ago. No need to muddy the waters or cloud the objective: Beat the slimy Saints and win the division. Joe doesn’t want to start thinking about the help the Bucs would need from the Panthers (!) in Atlanta if the Bucs cannot get the job done Sunday. Sadly, Bucs fans know too well what happens with this team after they curb-stomp an opponent, like they did crushing Carolina 48-14 yesterday. Beat the Lions; get your arse handed to you by the Broncos. Beat the Eagles, and choke against the Dixie Chicks. Kneecap the slimy Saints and then get MMA’ed by the Crows. Knock the socks off the Chargers and then look like dog manure against the Cowboys. While the goal is simple as can be and the Bucs will play a 5-11 team Sunday, Joe knows the Bucs’ pattern this season all too well. Regardless, should be a fun week leading up to the game. Stay Locked In Yesterday, Joe spoke to several offensive players and found out something interesting. Joe’s observation of the first half when the Bucs scored all their first five possessions was the team played pissed off. It was almost as if Bucs offensive coordinator Liam Coen was ashamed how sloppy his offense was last week in Dallas. They came out flaccid rather than strong and the Bucs never recovered. Yesterday felt like Coen had been on his offense’s case all week and was pressing the pedal to the metal knowing the defense needed a break. And if the Bucs offense played to its potential, the Stinking Panthers couldn’t keep pace. That’s pretty much what happened. Tristan Wirfs admitted to Joe that Joe’s observation was credible. Other players said they had an intense focus and a rapt attention to detail on Sunday. Joe sure hopes that attitude sticks next week. January football is not the time to play uninspired football and not have an ironclad-like focus. Mike Evans, Baker Mayfield Within Striking Distance Of Records  Future Hall of Fame receiver Mike Evans needs just 85 yards next week and he will have 1,000 yards receiving for 11 straight seasons, tying the great Jerry Rice’s all-time mark. It would have been a little less had the Bucs not accepted a penalty that wiped out an Evans catch for six yards. Evans also now ranks 21st all-time in total NFL touchdowns surpassing former Bucs receiver Tim Brown and Packers icon Don Hutson. Evans has 107 touchdowns. Also, Baker Mayfield is one touchdown pass away from 40 this season. Only one Bucs quarterback has thrown for 40 or more touchdowns. That would be Tom Brady in 2020 (40) and 2021 (43). The Duck Joe hopes whatever Bucs staffer carried the Bucs’ lucky duck off the field yesterday takes care of the thing and brings it back to The Licht House next week. The Bucs can use all the luck they can get on Sunday. The duck took on a life of its own in the stadium and even the players were playing along crediting the duck for luck. If someone is just waking up from an all-day snooze, Joe will set the scene.  Midway through the third quarter the Stinking Panthers were back to punt. All of a sudden, both the CBS network feed and the Bucs’ JumboTron showed that a duck had circled and landed on the field of The Licht House and waddled up to Trey Palmer who was back to receive the punt. Palmer, Buccaneers Sideline Reporter T.J. Rives told Joe after the game, was startled by the duck. He kept looking to the Bucs’ bench thinking play would be halted or looking for advice so the poor thing wouldn’t get trampled. Instead, as if the football gods were protecting the duck like a guardian angel, Joe Tryon-Shoyinka (!) blocked the Johnny Hekker punt. The loose ball went straight to J.J. Russell who scooped and scored from 23 yards out to give the Bucs a 41-14 lead. The game was oh-vah! “I don’t even like ducks,” Bucs receiver Jalen McMillan said, noting the duck was taking attention away from Bucs players who deserved run. Why the disgust over the duck by JTS and McMillan? They played for Washington in college. Their hated rival is the Oregon Ducks. They probably even despise Daffy Duck. So the legend of the duck lives on. Hopefully, the duck got care and a lot of corn to munch on this week so it can make a grand reappearance at The Licht House, sort of like the Auburn eagle. Impressive Rookie Class You know it was a good day for the rookies when Chris Braswell came out of hiding to record a sack. But look at the rookies who had an impact just yesterday: Center Graham Barton was pretty much invisible outside of an early holding penalty, which means he did a helluva job. Didn’t even notice a bad snap. Tykee Smith has had a solid, not great, but solid year. The nickel back got burned once or twice but overall he’s a solid if not dangerous member of the Bucs’ secondary. Jalen McMillan had two touchdowns and was wide-ass open on both his touchdown catches. He has six touchdown catches in the past four games. Bucky Irving? What do you want Joe to say? He’s a beast. Even seventh-round (!) pick Devin Culp was making plays yesterday with three catches for 52 yards. That’s a helluva draft class. The lone rookie you didn’t see yesterday was Elijah Klein and you don’t want to see him. That would mean the Bucs have an injured offensive lineman.|2024-12-30 05:00:00|1201|46|Sentiment score: 6|Five Things|Bucs victory reflections and future optimism.|2|Mixed sentiments with some optimistic and nostalgic comments but also concerns about future performance and decisions.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""MadMax"", ""post"": ""We were spying Penix\u2026.thats how we came across McMillan and Kulp\u2026just shh\u2026options are always open, Baker was our man, but what if he asked for too much\u2026.thats why you check, double check, triple check all options and what ifs\u2026"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""30th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""5:13"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""MadMax"", ""post"": ""Culp\u2026sorry"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""30th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""5:15"", ""am""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""FortMyersDave"", ""post"": ""Great article Joe!

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/the-jamel-dean-knee-injury/|The Jamel Dean Knee Injury(ies)|Here is what the Bucs have said about Jamel Dean injuring his knee late in the second quarter of yesterday’s destruction of the Stinking Panthers. Very little. When asked about Dean’s injury yesterday, Bucs coach Todd Bowles pretty much shrugged his shoulders when asked about what happened with Dean and the severity of his knee injury. “I don’t know at this time,” Bowles said. “We will see during the week. I’ll get results when I go back in.” So no light was shed. The CBS broadcast team said Dean injured both knees. As Joe walked into the Bucs’ locker room after the game, Dean was leaving. He was not on crutches, which is a good thing. But he was obviously limping. It almost looked to Joe that he may have needed crutches. Joe quickly asked Dean how he was doing and all he said was, “I’ll be fine” and headed out the door as quickly as his bum knee would allow. He smiled and seemed to be in a good mood. Masked emotions? Yesterday in place of Dean, cornerback Josh Hayes logged quite a few snaps. No, that’s not comforting. Bowles will have an update at his day-after presser shortly after noon on today.
