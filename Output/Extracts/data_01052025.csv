That winning streak has propelled the Bucs into the playoffs by winning the NFC South for the fourth straight season. In fact, Todd Bowles has known nothing but being a division champion as Bucs head coch. He’s the only head coach in team history that can boast a division crown in his first three seasons. But Bowles doesn’t seem to be a big believer that regular season momentum can sweep the Bucs all the way to New Orleans and the Super Bowl. The regular season is now in the past, Bowles said after today’s 27-19 win. Bowles has a good point. Just because you won games despite playing badly against bad teams, like today against the slimy Saints, that doesn’t mean you can get away with being sloppy and unfocused in the first half of a playoff game. The Bucs made it. They are in the postseason. So many teams are envious. Now it’s time to play like they are a division champion.|2025-01-05 20:21:00|174|43|5|Todd Bowles|Bucs playoff hopes cautious despite winning streak.|3|Mixed sentiments towards Todd Bowles' coaching, performance, and playoff prospects.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Oxycondomns"", ""post"": ""lets see how far the we do what we do mentality gets the bucs. im pulling for him but there needs to be consequences if bucs cant overcome a halftime deficit due to be ill prepared"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""5th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""8:28"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""LVMYBUCS"", ""post"": ""Look I like Bowles as a person but he doesn\u2019t have what it takes to get us deep into the playoffs.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/what-was-todd-bowles-thinking-about-on-the-final-play-to-mike-evans/|What Was Todd Bowles Thinking On The Final Play To Mike Evans?|Look, Joe knows Bucs coach Todd Bowles, at his core, is an old-school defensive guy. He played for Joe Gibbs. Worked for Bill Parcells. In a one-score game with the playoffs on the line, and only needing a kneel down to ice the win, would Parcells or Gibbs have allowed their quarterback to throw a pass, historic individual record on the line or not? Hell, no! All it would take is one slip up and the slimy Saints would be in position to doom the Bucs’ season. So when Bowles was asked about the final play, a short pass to Mike Evans so he could reach 1,000 yards, and giving Liam Coen and Baker Mayfield the green light to throw, Bowles confessed this was on his mind. “I didn’t want an interception,” Bowles said. LOL Spoken like a true old-school defensive coach. But at least Bowles was open-minded and trusted his coaches and players with the green light to try and keep history alive. Don’t think Bowles seriously discussed or thought of taking a knee? Remember, this is the same coach who, when Tom Brady was leading the Bucs on a game-winning drive in the final minute against Cleveland in 2022, pulled the ball out of Brady’s hands to play instead for overtime. Bowles said after that game his reasoning was Brady could have thrown a pick. To that point in the season (Nov. 27) Brady had a grand total of two picks. So Joe wants to thank Bowles for trusting his coaches and players enough to help Mike Evans make a little history and extend his streak to 11 years.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/ira-kaufmans-10-takeaways-from-bucs-saints-10/|Ira Kaufman’s 10 Takeaways From Bucs-Saints|BY IRA KAUFMAN From a nightmare to sweet dreams, all in 30 minutes. The Bucs rebounded from a sloppy, uninspired opening half to overwhelm the Saints 21-3 in the final two quarters Sunday, earning a fourth consecutive division title behind another stirring late-season surge. In the process, Mike Evans ran down history with a consequential 9-yard catch in the final seconds of a 27-19 triumph. It would have been prudent for Baker Mayfield to end the game by taking a knee, but thousands of fans and every member of the organization would have bemoaned the end of a historic 1,000-yard streak by a beloved Buccaneer. Jason Licht was waiting for Evans outside Tampa Bay’s locker room and their post-game embrace was long and emotional, knowing the Bucs accomplished their twin goals. Evans said he was determined to “chase history” and now he has crossed the finish line — just in time for a home playoff game. Just as Evans approaches the final years of a Hall of Fame career, a rookie receiver continues to open eyes across the league. Jalen McMillan’s 32-yard reception early in the fourth quarter put Tampa Bay ahead 20-19 and gave the third-round pick seven TD catches in the past five games. McMillan also hauled in a 33-yard pass on fourth-and-8 to set up his own score. Baker Mayfield threw for 221 yards and a pair of TDs, but much of his damage came on scrambles as he ran nine times for 68 yards, including a 28-yard dash on third-and-14 from his own 12 in the final minutes with New Orleans desperate to force a punt. “Baker’s been our rock all year,” said Evans, who finished with 74 catches for 1,004 yards and 11 scores. Once again, this team reminded its fan base that it’s foolish to count the Bucs out. A year ago, a 5-1 stretch run overcame a 4-7 start. The 2024 Bucs approached the bye week at 4-6, with a 4-game losing streak. No problem. This time, Tampa Bay won 6-of-7 to overtake the fading Falcons and claim a postseason berth for the fifth consecutive season. “The guys in this room don’t quit,” said guard Cody Mauch. “We just don’t.” Spencer Rattler had his way in the opening half, throwing for 181 yards as New Orleans grabbed a 16-6 advantage. Tampa Bay’s defense couldn’t get off the field due to missed tackles, missed assignments and general lethargy. Everything changed in the final 30 minutes as the Saints were limited to 61 yards, going 0-for-5 on third down. Helped by Mayfield’s scrambles, the Bucs ran for 179 yards while New Orleans averaged only 3.4 yards on 19 carries. Payne Durham chipped in a 6-yard TD catch and Bucky Irving ran for 89 yards and a score. How do you measure mental toughness? The Bucs showed their mettle by outscoring opponents 152-70 in the fourth quarter during the regular season. They’ve proven they know how to dig out of holes and now the Bucs stand on level ground in time for the NFL’s second season. Here’s how the Bucs overcame a dreadful start Sunday to finish 4-2 in the NFC South, sweeping the Saints and Panthers: * Buc fans have grown accustomed to Irving breaking off a long run and he obliged with a 25-yard dash against the Saints. The 125th player chosen in the draft, Irving ended his stunning rookie year with 1,514 yards from scrimmage. He shows no signs of hitting the rookie wall and Irving is now perhaps the No. 1 focal point for every defensive coordinator preparing for the Bucs. * From the stands to the sidelines, the reaction after Evans made his historic catch was electric. Buc fans stood and applauded Licht’s first-ever draft pick while teammates raced onto the field to show their appreciation. Keeping the streak alive for an 11th consecutive season meant a lot to both Evans and Mayfield, putting No. 13 on a pedestal shared only with Jerry Rice — the most prolific wide receiver pro football has ever seen. * The Bucs overcame 12 penalties and failed to force a turnover against the 5-12 Saints, who held halftime leads in both matchups this season. Tampa Bay outscored New Orleans by a combined margin of 48-3 in the second half and you have to wonder how long it will take for the Saints to be relevant in a weak division. * Mayfield shook off a dismal first half and willed the Bucs to victory with the season on the line. He finished with 41 TD passes and 4,505 passing yards, proving last year was no fluke. In the broadcast booth at Raymond James Stadium, Tom Brady couldn’t help but marvel at his successor’s competitive fire.  * YaYa Diaby was a force all afternoon with a sack, four tackles for loss and four of Tampa Bay’s six QB hits. * Zyon McCollum missed a tackle or two, but his four passes defended are evidence he was around the football from start to finish. * Tampa Bay’s offense has been the driving force behind a 10-win season, but it’s worth noting that Buc opponents averaged only 17 points in the final seven games. * Liam Coen wanted a diversified attack and his offense met the challenge. Evans led the way as four Buccaneers (Evans, Rachaad White, Irving and McMillan) scored at least eight TDs. Coen’s unit reached the end zone 57 times and converted third downs at a 51 percent clip. Those are heady numbers, especially considering Chris Godwin missed the final 10 games. * Sorry to break it to the Bowles haters, but he’s not going anywhere. In fact, the Glazers may be thinking about a contract extension. * For the second time in three weeks, the Buc defense was a step behind in the opening half. Cooper Rush and Rattler had too much time and receivers had too much space. That’s not a recipe for postseason success. BONUS TAKE * Going forward, the Bucs still look like the team to beat in the NFC South. The Falcons folded after opening a 3-game lead on Tampa Bay, the Saints need a quarterback and the Panthers are desperate for more playmakers. What makes the difference? Productive draft classes. |2025-01-05 18:51:00|1040|44|10|Ira Kaufman|Bucs dominate Saints|5|Mixed feelings about Bowles, playoff excitement, some dissatisfaction with coaching decisions and player performances.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Zzbucs"", ""post"": ""Agree on everything Sage, specially on the Bowles haters\u2026..they need to apologize!"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""5th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""7:09"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Bucsfan1988"", ""post"": ""Looks like we are going to play the Redskins!

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/four-nfc-south-titles-after-the-super-bowl-win/|Four NFC South Titles… After The Super Bowl Win|Some people wonder why Joe often refers to Jason Licht as the “Buccaneers Ring of Honor” general manager. This confuses Joe. Licht is the best GM in team history. He’ll be in the Buccaneers Ring of Honor. Tampa Bay won a Super Bowl, and then proceeded to win four consecutive NFC South titles under Licht’s watch. The last was crowned today as the Bucs beat the slimy Saints 27-19. Did the Bucs win those four division titles thanks to historic coaching jobs? Absolutely not. Joe is not collectively slapping around Bruce Arians and Todd Bowles, only noting that Licht put enough quality groceries on the field in all those seasons — despite being way over his salary cap credit card limit in 2023 and 2024. So few teams in NFL history have won four division titles after winning a Super Bowl. It’s an achievement that must be recognized. Do the Bucs have the best rookie class in the NFL? They might, but it’s absolute in the top-tier of NFL teams. And that group arrived after the Bucs got to the playoffs last sason with double-digit rookies on the roster.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/teammates-react-to-mike-evans-extending-streak/|Teammates React To Mike Evans Extending Streak|For a moment Joe thought he was watching a baseball game. Mike Evans had just reached 1,000 yards for the regular season on the very last play from scrimmage today, catching a nine-yard pass from Baker Mayfield. Evans spiked the ball, came to the sidelines and was mobbed by teammates. They surrounded him, suffocated him, jumped on top of him and tried to tackle him. It reminded Joe of a key home run to win a baseball playoff game when the hero crosses the plate. Bucs linebacker K.J. Britt was in that mosh pit. Britt told Joe after the game that was a demonstration of how much Evans’ teammates respect him, like him and were focused on trying to help push him past the finish line. The streak is now 11 seasons, tying the great Jerry Rice with the most consecutive years of 1,000 receiving yards. “That’s historic, you know?” Britt told Joe. “To see Mike tie up Jerry Rice’s record, how many times will you see that in your lifetime? To witness that and be a part of that, it showed how much it meant to the team and how much it meant to Mike. “This team is unbelievable. A bunch of selfless guys that just want to play football and win. At the end of the day, that’s how this team is going to make it far: Guys that want to play football and see [teammates] win.” There were other signs that today just wasn’t about the Bucs, but also the team’s greatest offensive player. Maybe 15 feet away from Britt was Vita Vea’s locker. Sunday was a hat-and-T-shirt game. Win the game, win the division, make the playoffs and get a cap and T-shirt! But Vea’s NFC South Champions cap was in his locker. Was it too ugly for him? No. Instead of wearing a brand new 2024 NFC South Champions cap, Vea was wearing a pewter and red Mike Evans cap. Saluting a fellow warrior. Every Bucs player Joe spoke with in the locker room admitted Evans’ streak was very much on their minds all game long. Zyon McCollum said on the final slimy Saints’ drive, he was telling other Bucs defensive backs that they had to get the ball back so Evans would have a chance. When the defense was on the sidelines, Joe was told there was constant chatter, “How many yards does Mike need?” Cody Mauch also told Joe the offensive players, even when in the huddle, were thinking of getting the ball to Evans. “Everybody wanted that for him,” defensive lineman Logan Hall said. “There wasn’t a single person on the sidelines that wasn’t thinking about it. Really happy for him, really excited for him. He’s probably the most deserving person out there.” Mauch noted Evans’ streak was a constant stream of thought throughout the game. “We were all aware of it. First things first. We had to go down and get the lead and if Mike can get it along the way, that’s great.” Mauch said on the ensuing slimy Saints possession after Bucky Irving gave the Bucs a 27-16 lead just before the two-minute warning, he knew the defense would get the ball back. Why? They knew Evans and the Bucs offense depended on them. “Oh, 100 percent,” Mauch said. “It was in the back of our minds for sure.” Mauch suggested to Joe that the fact Evans, through all his injuries and missed time and the team’s adversity they fought through today, was still able to keep his streak alive showed how much of a stud he is. Mauch said that for years, when someone asks how good Evans is, he will point to the final play of the game in which Evans pushed past 1,000 yards receiving. “I think every person in the building knew where that ball was going to go,” Mauch said. “And he made the play anyway. He’s one of the best to ever do it — the best to ever do it.”|2025-01-05 18:27:00|668|23|8|Mike Evans|Team celebrates Evans' historic 1|6|Fans are overwhelmingly happy and supportive of Mike Evans' record-breaking achievement in football.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""PSL Bob"", ""post"": ""I was so happy to see Baker throw to Mike on that last play.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/all-bucky-irving-zero-rachaad-white/|All Bucky Irving; Zero Rachaad White|Strange look for the Bucs offense today. Rachaad White didn’t touch the ball once and Joe didn’t like it. It was the first time in White’s career that he didn’t get a touch in a game. Look, Joe’s no cheerleader in the White fan club, but damn, White is a valuable contributor. In the biggest game of the year, offensive coordinator Liam Coen pulled the plug. Strange. Even No. 3 running back Sean Tucker got two carries (16 yards). White finished the regular season with 144 carries for 613 rushing yards and 3 TDs. He also racked up 6 receiving touchdowns, as part of his 51-catch season for 393 yards. Think about that. White had 1,000+ yards from scrimmage this season and the Bucs had no use for him today. When the Bucs made Bucky Irving the starting running back last week against Carolina, they really meant it! Joe hopes the Bucs find a complementary role for White. He remains a weapon.|2025-01-05 17:51:00|162|67|3|Rachaad White|Bucs offense strange without White's contribution|3|Mixed opinions on White, some criticizing his performance, others defending his value and potential trade.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""FrontFour"", ""post"": ""Tuck & Buck next season.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/a-streak-snapped-at-the-licht-house/|A Streak Snapped At The Licht House|So the Mike Evans streak wasn’t the only streak on Joe’s mind this afternoon. And thankfully, fortunately, this streak is oh-vah! The Bucs entering today’s game against the slimy Saints were 0-6 this season when the opponent scored first. It was a baffling factoid. The Bucs offense was so good yet this team couldn’t ever overcome a measly 3-0 deficit. Then, on Blake Grupe’s 35-yard field goal, the slimy Saints took a 3-0 lead. Joe just wanted to shove his head in an oven. How depressed was Joe? Joe seriously considered beginning to tap out stories on how the Bucs choked away a gift-wrapped NFC South title. It wasn’t easy for the Bucs today. Last week Bucs coach Todd Bowles flatly stated the slimy Saints game would be a “dogfight.” Boy, was he right. The Bucs had to scratch and claw and fight right down to the last minute to pull out the win. But here we are. The Bucs have another home game next weekend. The Bucs, for the fourth-straight season, are NFC South champions. That grotesque streak of letting the opponent score first and win is now a thing of the past.|2025-01-05 17:35:00|194|34|5|Joe|Bucs break losing streak|7|Mixed sentiments with praise for Todd Bowles' coaching and success, but some criticism as well.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""TheBucsAnthem"", ""post"": ""Well that\u2019s a Todd Bowles mantra Joe!"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""5th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""5:37"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""ModHairKen"", ""post"": ""Bowles delivered."", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""5th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""5:37"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""Goodbuc'nlife"", ""post"": ""TheBucsAnthem Says: January 5th, 2025 at 5:37 pm Well that\u2019s a Todd Bowles mantra Joe!"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""5th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""5:43"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter3"": {""username"": ""LakelandSteve"", ""post"": ""Baker was an absolute beast in the 4\u2019th quarter.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/jalen-mcmillans-historic-finish/|Jalen McMillan’s Historic Finish|So the regular season just ended with rookie Jalen McMillan hauling in 24 catches, 316 yards and 7 touchdowns through his final five games. Joe’s never seen a guy pull off those kinds of numbers with limited targets. McMillan seemed to take it all to another level today with two massive catches with the Bucs’ season on the line, the biggest on a 4th-and-8 bomb from the Saints’ 42 yard line. That was followed by a 32-yard touchdown grab, the game-winner, two plays later. Mike Evans and Todd Bowles talked about McMillan’s growth and development after the game. Bowles even shrugged off McMillan’s personal foul for making a gun-looking gesture; Bowles said McMillan’s fingers were taped together so his gesture wasn’t what it appared to be. Regardless, Joe is impressed. McMillan didn’t have the greatest rookie season for Bucs receivers. He fought through injuries and drops. Heck, he caught two fewer balls than Trey Palmer did last season. But McMillan proved to be dangerous. Eight touchdowns is not luck. McMillan looks like a true No. 2 receiver, whereas Palmer and many others before him never have. A full offseason in an NFL weight room will do McMillan a lot of good, as will playoff experience and more seasoning alongside Baker Mayfield and Mike Evans. What a special finish by McMillan.|2025-01-05 17:29:00|220|38|8|Jalen McMillan|Rookie season ends with impressive performance & growth amidst challenges.|6|Fans are optimistic about WRs but have mixed feelings about Godwin's future with the team.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""William Walls"", ""post"": ""Our WR room has two legit #1 receivers, plus a clear #2 now.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/liam-coen-watch-begins/|Liam Coen Watch Begins|Joe understands that maybe after the Bucs beat the slimy Saints to win the NFC South title today, not every Bucs fan will still consider Bucs offensive coordinator Liam Coen to be the next Bill Walsh. However, one game doesn’t make Joe think Coen won’t be working as a head coach somewhere else next month. In Joe’s mind, Liam Coen Watch has just launched. The Patriots canned coach Jerod Mayo after one season this afternoon. Look out, Coen. Joe thinks of all the current openings, New England is the greatest threat of pulling Coen away from the Bucs. Coen from Rhode Island, grew up a Patriots fan and, most important, New England has a budding star rookie quarterback. Coen isn’t going to any team that doesn’t have a stud quarterback. That’s career suicide. Why not the Bears and Caleb Williams? That organization is a train wreck. New England, under creepy Bob Kraft, is a solid if not strong organization with its act together. New England is one team that frightens Joe. And now that job is open.|2025-01-05 17:25:00|177|52|5|Liam Coen|Speculation on potential move to New England from Tampa Bay.|8|Fans are generally optimistic and supportive of retaining Liam Coen as the offensive coordinator.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""FirstTimePoster"", ""post"": ""Back up the Brinks truck.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/more-history-for-mike-evans/|More History For Mike Evans|What an emotional day for Mike Evans, Bucs players and fans. Eleven regular seasons of Mike Evans needed an exclamation point — five more yards to hit 1,000 receiving for the season and a tie of Jerry Rice’s all-time record. The game was over. Any additional Bucs snap would risk a catastrophe that potentially could cost the Bucs their NFC South crown in the final seconds. Still, Todd Bowles didn’t care. The Bucs called a play for Mike Evans and he got the yardage. The emotional video is below and the home fans were on their feet. “You saw the stadium erupt; you saw the sideline erupt,” Baker Mayfield said, noting how special the record was for all involved. “History is hard to come by,” Evans said. Of the fans, Evans was fired up. “It was amazing. They made it that much sweeter. … I love those guys to death.” When Bucky Irving scored a touchdown to put the Bucs up eight points, Evans said he wasn’t dejected, but he was jacked up for the defense to stop the slimy Saints and give him one more catch. “I was hoping we’d get a stop because I can’t pass up history,” Evans said. What a day. Even Joe got emotional. Evans said hitting 1,000 this year was extra special because he missed games with injuries. Evans said his pulled hamstring was perhaps the worst of his career. He also added that he had years worth inspiration from Randy Moss. Years ago, Evans broke Moss’ record of consecutive 1,000 seasons to start a career. He said Moss told Evans after that to set a high bar and get 1,000 in every season he plays.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/welcome-back-todd-bowles-bucs-win-nfc-south-by-2-games/|Welcome Back, Todd Bowles! Bucs Win NFC South By 2 Games.|Rough day for the legions of Bucs fans that aren’t supporters of head coach Todd Bowles.  Tampa Bay finished the season today with a 10-7 record after a somewhat ugly 27-19 win against the slimy Saints. That’s 10-7 after losing Chris Godwin and Antoine Winfield for a half a season. And the Bucs lost starters Jordan Whitehead and Jamel Dean to injured reserve at points this season, and starting right tackle Luke Goedeke also was lost four games with a concussion, plus Mike Evans missed 3 1/2 games and wasn’t healthy in others. Joe could list other injuries and self-inflicted wounds, but the Bucs and Bowles grinded, grew and perservered through it all. Bowles closed 6-1 after the bye week, possibly exactly what he needed to save his job. Well done, Coach!

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/career-high-rushing-day-for-baker-mayfield/|Career High Rushing Day For Baker Mayfield|The Bucs needed every one of Baker Mayfield’s 68 yards rushing today. Yeah, sixty-eight! That was by far a career high for the Bucs’ franchise quarterback, who got most of those yards in the fourth quarter in today’s division-clinching win against the slimy Saints. On 3rd-and-14 at the Tampa Bay 12 yard line with 4:15 remaining and the Bucs leading 20-19, Mayfield scrambled up the middle for 28 yards. Joe’s not sure the Bucs win the game without that play. Huge! But that wasn’t Mayfield’s only big run of the day. He had a season-high nine rushes. Overall, Mayfield had 62 rushes this season, same total as last year except Mayfield more than doubled his production. The sometimes hidden rushing element to Mayfield’s game was in the spotlight today. Joe expects plenty more of it in the postseason.|2025-01-05 16:31:00|138|43|7|Baker Mayfield|Career-high rushing performance propels Bucs to division-clinching victory.|8|Fans express high optimism for Baker and the Bucs, praising his skills and resilience.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""SB~LV"", ""post"": ""Saved the day!"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""5th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""4:32"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""BucsBeast"", ""post"": ""Baker is our Franchise QB for the next 10 years."", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""5th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""4:33"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""NCFloridiot"", ""post"": ""Has nothing to do with you Joe"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""5th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""4:35"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter3"": {""username"": ""Herbiebuc"", ""post"": ""That pass to Jalen McMillan when got called for taunting was so clutch!"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""5th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""4:35"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter4"": {""username"": ""SlyPirate"", ""post"": ""HUMONGUS EFFORT \u2026"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""5th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""4:35"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter5"": {""username"": ""Mr_Barf"", ""post"": ""That possession started at our 5 & he willed us to the td pressure response by Bucs 1-43 now"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""5th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""4:36"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter6"": {""username"": ""Permanently Moderated"", ""post"": ""Straight up stud."", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""5th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""4:36"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter7"": {""username"": ""TheBucsAnthem"", ""post"": ""Honestly, Baker probably is one of the biggest reasons the Bucs even had a chance in the playoffs "", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""5th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""4:36"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter8"": {""username"": ""Buddha"", ""post"": ""Watch out for Carolina next year.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/buccaneers-27-saints-19/|Buccaneers 27, Saints 19|How bout those Bucs!! With everything on the line, the Bucs came out and dropped a runny deuce on the field of The Licht House. No duck flew in to save them. But someone found plenty of Imodium and Angel Soft and the Bucs found themselves in the fourth quarter. Tampa Bay is 10-7 and NFC South champs for the fourth consecutive season! Blame Todd Bowles. Blame Liam Coen (damn, what a time for a rough playcalling game). Blame the punter. Blame injuries. Blame the soft zone defense. Blame penalties. Blame whatever you want for the brutal start against a bad slimy Saints team. “These unforced errors, you just can’t have those in these types of games,” Tom Brady said on the FOX broadcast. It doesn’t matter. Baker Mayfield and Jalen McMillan pulled the Bucs out of their funk with fourth-down heroics — and then a touchdown bomb — on the early-fourth-quarter drive that gave the Bucs a 20-19 lead. Yaya Diaby came to play with 4 tackles for loss and a sack. Zyon McCollum wasn’t perfect but he made some huge plays. The Bucs again got huge catches from backup tight ends Devin Culp and Payne Durham. And what can Joe say about Mayfield. He was spectacular in the fourth quarter, on the ground and through the air. Mike Evans even got his 1,000 yard streak on the game’s final play — and the $3 million bonus that came with it. Props to Bowles for risking the game a meaningless play. It’s on to the playoffs!|2025-01-05 16:16:00|257|130|5|Buccaneers|Bucs win division title in intense game against Saints.|7|Positive excitement and support for the team, especially in achieving milestones and victories.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Red86"", ""post"": ""Great Job getting in the playoff.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/big-vita-vea-nearing-big-career-year/|Big Vita Vea Nearing Big Career Year|Now Joe doesn’t know if it was the Bucs’ sports science people or the trainers or analytics specialist Jackie Davidson or if it was intuition from Bucs coach Todd Bowles. Last offseason, the Bucs (you pick who) ordered/pleaded with Pro Bowl nose tackle Vita Vea to drop some weight. When he was shown at Washington’s spring game, Vea almost looked like a different person. Well, Vita is “this close” to having a career-year in several categories, even though he missed a chunk of the Lions game and all of the Broncos game with a sprained knee. Here is where Vea is about to have a career-year: • Needs a half-sack to tie his personal best of 6.5. • Needs one quarterback hit to tie his personal best (13). • Needs four tackles to match his career-high (43). • Needs two solo tackles to tie his personal best (28). Just based on how well Vea has played this year with all of these season marks about to fall, whoever hatched the plan for Vea to shed weight knew what the hell they were doing.|2025-01-05 01:17:00|183|19|7|Vita Vea|Vea close to career highs in key stats.|5|Mixed sentiments about weight loss impact on career, health, and performance of player Vita Vea.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Mac"", ""post"": ""We were all worried that shedding of weight may hurt his game and it hasn\u2019t at all thankfully.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/jalen-mcmillan-and-randy-moss/|Jalen McMillan And Randy Moss|Here’s a stat that blew Joe’s mind. Jalen McMillan is on the cusp of having the greatest streak of touchdowns for a rookie receiver this century. Yeah, Joe knows that a lot of Bucs fans were grumbling a month or so ago that McMillan was way overhyped and hasn’t come close to living up to raves that floated out of One Buc Palace this summer. Well, as Keith Olbermann would say, that grumbling about McMillan may have been premature jocularity. McMillan, as Sara Walsh of NFL Network points out, has six touchdowns in his last four games. If McMillan catches a touchdown today, that will be five straight games with a touchdown for the rookie. The last time a rookie receiver had more than five straight games with a touchdown was back in 1998. That rookie’s name was Randy Moss. Moss finished that season strong like McMillan is in his rookie year. Moss ended his rookie regular season with seven straight games with a touchdown catch. Any time a rookie receiver is somehow linked to Moss, that’s a major compliment. Just ask Mike Evans, who was also compared to Moss as a rookie. How’d that work out?|2025-01-05 01:03:00|197|27|7|Jalen McMillan|McMillan on the verge of breaking rookie touchdown record this century.|6|Mixed reactions with some optimism, concern, and frustration expressed by commenters.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Whit"", ""post"": ""Go Bucs"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""5th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""1:29"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Crickett Baker"", ""post"": ""YAY!

As BSPN points out, the slimy Saints, today’s Bucs opponent, haven’t broken 20 points in a game for the past five straight games. That’s bad. Further, this five-game streak is currently tied for their franchise-worst. If the Bucs can hold the slimy Saints to 20 points or below, it will be the worst streak in slimy Saints history. Don’ cha’ just wanna cry? The Bucs are in the middle of the pack of the NFL in average points allowed, 17th. But with this offense, the beat-up Bucs defense ought to have a respectable outing this afternoon. Since the slimy Saints’ bye week in Week 12, New Orleans has averaged 11 points a game. That’s brutal. If the Bucs somehow throw away this game and let the New Orleans’ offense go crazy, it will go down as one of the worst choke jobs in history.|2025-01-05 00:35:00|158|36|2|Slimy Saints|Slimy Saints offense struggles|3|Mixed feelings among commenters, from trade analysis to team rivalries and game predictions.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""JTHV"", ""post"": ""Myles Garrett"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""5th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""12:41"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""MadMax"", ""post"": ""Take it serious!!!!

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/gameday-tampa-bay-318/|GameDay Tampa Bay|Game 17 Slimy Saints (5-11) at Bucs (9-7) Kickoff: 1 p.m. TV: FOX (WTVT-TV Channel 13, locally) with Kevin Burkhardt, Tom Brady and Erin Andrews.  Streaming: NFL+. (Geographic restrictions apply; subscription may be required). Radio: Buccaneers Radio Network WXTB-FM 97.9 in the Tampa-St. Petersburg region (Transmisiones de radio en español en WTMP-FM 96.1 y WMGG-AM 1470 en Tampa). Additional stations throughout Florida on the Buccaneers Radio Network can be found here. The game also will be broadcast on SiriusXM Channel 229 (Buccaneers Radio Network feed). Weather: Going to start off chilly, per AccuWeather.com. Tailgaters will have to huddle around the grill as it will be in the upper-50s. By kickoff, it should be T-shirt weather with an expected temperature of 69. That should climb to 74 by the second half and when the game ends, look for the temperature to be 73, all under partly sunny skies. Odds: Per Hard Rock Bet, as of midnight, Bucs -14 (-1100); over/under 44.5. Referees: Adrian Hill and his gang will work today’s game. Hill’s outfit has the ninth-most flags thrown in the NFL. Home teams are 6-9 in which Hill and his posse work. Injuries: Slimy Saints — Out QB Derek Carr (left hand), RB Kendre Miller (concussion). Doubtful: RB Alvin Kamara (groin). Questionable: LB Willie Gay (shoulder), TE Juwan Johnson (knee), WR Chris Olave (head), DE Payton Turner (ankle), LB Peter Werner (concussion). Bucs — Out: CB Jamel Dean (knee), S Antoine Winfield (knee), S Jordan Whitehead (car accident). Doubtful: TE Cade Otton (knee). Questionable: DL Will Gholston (knee), WR Sterling Shepard (hamstring). Outlook: Must-win. Win (or tie)-and-in. That’s what is at stake today. The Bucs win (or tie) and the Bucs will host a playoff game next weekend. Bucs lose and the Dixie Chicks win, it’s off to the DR. If the Bucs lose and the Dixie Chicks tie or lose, the Bucs can still back door their way into the playoffs. But the easiest way to take care of all of this is for the Bucs to slam the slimy Saints. So Bucs fans, here is what you want to happen to ensure the Bucs win. When any of the following happens this season, the Bucs are undefeated: Score first, Lavonte David records a sack, the Bucs rack up five sacks, Baker Mayfield throws four touchdowns, Mayfield completes 80 percent of his passes, Mike Evans has 90 or more receiving yards, Bucky Irving has 100 scrimmage yards or Tykee Smith gets a pick. Any of those things happen, the Bucs have yet to lose a game this season. The Bucs are one of the best running teams in the NFL; the slimy Saints have a trash run defense. The Bucs have one of the better passing attacks in the NFL; the slimy Saints have a lousy pass defense. The Bucs have one of the best offenses in the NFL; the slimy Saints have a trash defense. Since their bye, the Bucs have averaged 33 points a game; since their bye, the slimy Saints have averaged 11 points a game. Simply put, with all the high stakes involved in this game, if the Bucs don’t win, it will be as colossal of a choke job as Joe has seen. Fun facts: Slimy Saints QB Spencer Rattler had a career-high 46 yards rushing in Week 17. … In his last game against the Bucs in Oct. 2022, RB Clyde Edwards-Heleire ran for 92 yards and two touchdowns. … LB Demario Davis is looking for his fourth straight game with 10 or more tackles including a tackle for loss. … LB Pete Werner tied a career-high of 13 tackles last week. … Bucs QB Baker Mayfield needs one touchdown to become the second Bucs quarterback in franchise history to throw for 40 touchdowns. The Bucs are undefeated when Mayfield throws for 80 percent completion percentage or throws for four touchdowns. … RB Bucky Irving leads all rookie running backs with (1,430 scrimmage yards. … WR Mike Evans needs 85 yards receiving to hit 1,000 yards receiving for the 11th straight season. … The Bucs are undefeated this season when ILB  Lavonte David records a sack. With two sacks today he will set a career-high with 7.5 sacks in a season less than three weeks before turning 35. …  DT Vita Vea has two sacks in his last three games against the slimy Saints. … DT Calijah Kancey looks to extend career-highs in sacks (7.5) and tackles for loss (11). …  sacks and 10 tackles for loss in 10 games this season. … CB Zyon McCollum is looking for his third-straight game with a pass defensed.|2025-01-05 00:00:00|772|10|6|GameDay Tampa Bay|Bucs face Slimy Saints in crucial must-win playoff scenario.|7|Mixed sentiment with enthusiasm for Bucs game and negative views towards the Saints.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""JTHV"", ""post"": ""Myles Garrett"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""5th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""12:38"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""JTHV"", ""post"": ""Joe your advertising company is absolutely killing your platform"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""5th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""12:40"", ""am""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""Saskbucs"", ""post"": ""Go Bucs!
