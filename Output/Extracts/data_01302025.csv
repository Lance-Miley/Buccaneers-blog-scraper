https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/no-wide-receiver-is-not-a-priority/|No, Wide Receiver Is Not A Priority|“This Joe” believes there is nothing resembling the crater-sized hole on the Bucs’ roster than the one at inside linebacker. But a member of the PFF tribe seems to think otherwise. Zoltán Buday of the PFF tribe cobbled together a list of the highest priorities on each NFL team’s roster. He doesn’t see the Bucs going after an inside linebacker. Or a safety. Or a corner. Or even a pass rusher. In fact, Buday doesn’t even think any defender is a priority. Instead, Buday believes the Bucs should go after a receiver. Tampa Bay Buccaneers: Invest in a wide receiver Only two Tampa Bay wide receivers earned [strong reviews] in 2024 — Chris Godwin and Mike Evans. … However, Godwin is coming off an injury and is expected to hit free agency next month, while Evans will turn 32 before the start of the 2025 season. The Bucs also lacked youth at the position — Jalen McMillan was the team’s only receiver under 28 to log more than 300 snaps. [McMillan] showed improvement as the season progressed. Well, McMillan showed more than just improvement. He looked like the stud many thought he would be based on how he stood out in training camp. In a vacuum, Joe could sort of understand what Buday is suggesting. But it shouldn’t be a priority. Maybe a receiver in the third round isn’t an awful thing. “This Joe” believes the Bucs’ draft this spring should be straight-up all defenders. (The other Joe would die from a heart attack if this happened.) For now, Joe is waiting to see what Bucs AC/DC-loving general manager Jason Licht and coach Todd Bowles come up with for an offensive coordinator. If the guy is a run-run-run-your-boat, blasting-up-the-middle kind of guy, Joe then thinks there is a reasonalbe possibility Chris Godwin may not return. If the new offensive coordinator doesn’t want to pass much, it’s then hard for the bean counters at One Buc Palace to justify paying two receivers $20 million each a season. In a big picture view, Joe gets what Buday is suggesting, especially when Mike Evans and Godwin will be 32 and 29, respectively — geezers for NFL receivers. The Bucs do need another young receiver. But it surely isn’t a priority when the Bucs have more holes on defense than a slice of Swiss cheese.|2025-01-30 10:30:00|391|60|7|Zoltán Buday|Bucs should invest in young wide receiver.|5|Mixed opinions on WR draft pick, with defense as a priority.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/is-this-the-year-for-a-veteran-bucs-backup-qb/|Is This The Year For A Veteran Bucs Backup QB?|Yes, popular Bucs backup quarterback Kyle Trask is a pending free agent. And considering he was “this close” to beating out Pro Bowler Baker Mayfield for the 2023 starting job, Joe suspects there will be significant demand for Trask’s services. Yeah, Joe’s being sarcastic. Nobody knows if Trask is any good or not. He turns 27 soon and hasn’t started a game. Over at One Buc Palace, when they’re not overwhelmed by hate of El Serpiente, departed playcaller Liam Coen, officials believe 2025 is a win-now, win-big year. Joe’s not sure it’s an all-in mentality like it was in 2021, but it might be close. So that has Joe wondering if the Bucs will look to a veteran backup quarterback to pair with Mayfield, a guy who has won games and reasonably could be expected to be a quality Band-Aid if Mayfield got injured. The free agent crop of quarterbacks is large this season. Joe could see the Bucs sniffing a Taylor Heinicke or Andy Dalton or Jimmy Garoppolo, who spent last season learning Sean McVay’s offense for only $3.2 million. Buccaneers GM Jason Licht had dabbled in this area previously when he signed Ryan Fitzpatrick before the 2017 season. Joe gets the cliché, “If you lose your starter, you’re cooked regardless.” But Joe also understands how valuable a seasoned backup can be (see the 2019 Saints or 2023 Browns). As for Heinicke, he reminds Joe of Mayfield a little. And it has say something that Jim Harbaugh traded a draft pick for him in August. For those wondering, no, Joe is not lobbying for the return of America’s Turnover Machine, Mr. Entertainment, Jameis Winston, though that would be great fun.|2025-01-30 08:45:00|281|65|2|Kyle Trask|Uncertain future for veteran Bucs backup quarterback options.|2|Mixed opinions on Trask's role, some positivity but skepticism and criticism prevail.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""HC Grover"", ""post"": ""Just keeps looking worse for this year."", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""30th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""8:51"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""gofortheface30"", ""post"": ""4500 yards, 41/16, 70% comp.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/todd-bowles-has-graham-bartons-back/|Todd Bowles Has Graham Barton’s Back|Joe likes to say rookies play like rookies because they are rookies. But there is one Bucs rookie that Bucs coach Todd Bowles is confident will raise his game in 2025. Center Graham Barton sure showed promise that he could be one of the league’s better centers. But man, he has to work on snaps. Sadly for the Bucs, that nasty issue crept up at the worst time, when the Bucs appeared on the doorstep of taking a lead in the wild card loss. Yes, Joe knows Barton was trying to catch the Commandos offsides. But that earlier-than-expected snap screwed up the play, badly, and spooked Bowles to the point he instead chose to kick a game-tying field goal, angering many Bucs fans. In his final media availability for the 2024 season, Bowles heaped a lot of praise on Barton. “I liked the steadiness that Graham Barton showed as a rookie,” Bowles said. “Playing one of the toughest spots on the field, going against a Pro Bowler almost every week and just doing his job and coming to work every day with a lunch pail attitude. “Making blitz adjustments and stunt adjustments aren’t easy for a first-year center.” Barton’s inexperience as a center showed. To be fair, it wasn’t really that much worse than when Ali Marpet played center and even Ryan Jensen in his first Bucs season (2018). Those two guys could just about be counted on for one shaky snap a game. That’s about what Barton was doing. And he was only a rookie. Joe’s eager to see how Barton plays now that he has a full NFL season under his belt and what an offseason in an NFL weight room will do for the guy.|2025-01-30 07:00:00|288|25|7|Graham Barton|Todd Bowles optimistic about Bucs rookie center's potential.|7|Comments express optimism about players' potential and growth despite rookie mistakes.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""ModHairKen"", ""post"": ""Barton was a tremendous upgrade.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/why-the-rush-to-extend-luke-goedeke/|Why The Rush To Extend Luke Goedeke?|Unless Bucs right tackle Luke Goedeke has been telling people off the record he’s going launch Operation Shutdown like left tackle Tristan Wirfs did last year, Joe doesn’t understand the hyperventilating to extend Goedeke’s contract. Over at BSPN, it seems to be a theme that Goedeke’s contract must be extended. Now. Why? Even Eagles fan Ben Solak has joined the parade. Big prediction for the offseason: A big extension will come down the mountain for Goedeke, who has become a rock-solid right tackle opposite Tristan Wirfs and is approaching the final year of his rookie deal. Something in the range of the Spencer Brown deal (four years, $72 million) would be more than deserved. And after Goedeke’s extension is signed, the conversations with cornerback Zyon McCollum will begin. Unless Goedeke forces the issue — and he may — why spend money when you don’t have to? Perhaps Licht wants to rework Goedeke’s contract to make it team-friendly so Licht can go out in six weeks and buy some defenders when the free agency dinner bell rings. If that’s the angle, OK. Joe gets that. Football is a violent game. What if Goedeke, on the heels of an expensive new contract, suffers a major injury or another concussion? (He missed four games with concussion this season.) Then the Bucs also would have to spend a lot of Team Glazer loot on a replacement. That’s a good way to screw up your salary cap. Yeah, waiting until the last minute to re-sign Goedeke might cost extra Team Glazer loot in the long run. The good thing here is the salary cap, short of a global pandemic, always goes up. And yes, Goedeke threatening Operation Shutdown is a real possibility. His current rookie contract expires after the 2025 season. Joe just doesn’t see the need to rush. The Bucs can find extra cap room in other ways.|2025-01-30 03:45:00|314|26|2|Luke Goedeke|Questioning the rush to extend contract|2|Uncertainty and caution regarding player extensions in the comments.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""stpetebucsfan"", ""post"": ""I agree about the \u201cviolent\u201d sport.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/blocked-2/|Blocked!|Just as Joe believed, new Jags coach and former Bucs offensive coordinator Liam Coen tried to pluck someone from his former offensive staff with the Bucs. And Joe fears this won’t be the last time Coen and the Jags try. Per Jeremy Fowler of BSPN, the Jags requested permission to interview Bucs offensive line coach Kevin Carberry. But Bucs AC/DC-loving general manager Jason Licht, likely still seething from last week’s dramatic events involving Coen, wouldn’t have any of it. Licht threw a Tristan Wirfs-like block on the Jags and Licht pancaked Coen’s attempt to swipe Carberry. Joe is happy about this. For now. Joe is still frightened that Coen will try to hire Carberry as an offensive coordinator (in title only) and the Bucs and Licht have no power to stop that. Carberry, in his first year with the Bucs, did an absolutely kickarse job. Joe could argue the Bucs had a top-five offensive line. If the Bucs can somehow keep Coen from grabbing Carberry, Joe would consider that a monster win for a so-far sad start to the Bucs’ offseason.|2025-01-30 00:00:00|181|32|5|Kevin Carberry|Jags attempt to hire Bucs coach blocked by Licht.|2|Mixed sentiments with negativity towards Coen.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Aqualung"", ""post"": ""Liam needs to find a jaguar\u2019s head in his bed when he wakes up some day."", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""30th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""12:05"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""OR Buc"", ""post"": ""Bringing him on as OC would keep Coen from bringing in his buddy from Seattle."", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""30th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""12:26"", ""am""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""Leopold Stotch"", ""post"": ""El Serpiente strikes again\u2026 He\u2019s going to keep trying too.
