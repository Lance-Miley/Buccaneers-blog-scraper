https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/liam-coen-no-real-need-to-throw-deep/|Liam Coen: No Real Need To Throw Deep|Though NextGen Stats has yet to publish Baker Mayfield’s passing chart from the win over Carolina, throwing deep in that game wasn’t a thing. And if anything has been consistent this season, it is that the Bucs run a dink-and-dunk offense. Seldom does Mayfield attempt a pass in a game over 20 yards downfield. But so what, right? The Bucs offense is not the problem. The Bucs often score first — and on the first drive. Today, Bucs offensive coordinator Liam Coen was asked about throwing so few deep passes. Coen’s answer and his facial expression to the question suggested he’s not really losing sleep about fixing something that isn’t broken. “Nah, it doesn’t bother me too much,” Coen said. “I think we have enough ways to get the ball where we want it. “Yeah, I’d love to be able to throw it down the field a bunch. Just hasn’t really been quite our M.O.” Now Coen didn’t elaborate on that but Joe has to believe no Chris Godwin and being careful with Mike Evans (after he missed three games) are big reasons. For example, when Evans was still rehabbing his hamstring, Coen said sending Evans on go-routes may not be wise as the Bucs try to avoid having Evans pop another hamstring. Coen didn’t dismiss the possibility of turning Mayfield loose sometime this season, but his body language sure looked like he’s disinterested. “Whether that stays consistent the next four or five weeks, I’m not sure,” Coen said. “But yeah, I think we could definetly get the ball into some deeper spots. But it’s not really been a huge impact in the system so far.” As Joe stated, the offense is not the problem. So no need to tinker with the plan of attack. It’s working, even with few downfield attempts.|2024-12-05 16:26:00|302|42|6|Liam Coen|Bucs offense content with conservative passing approach.|2|Mixed views on offense & defense, concerns about Baker's deep ball accuracy, hope for improvement.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""JimBobBuc"", ""post"": ""Too bad our track star Palmer hasn\u2019t developed last year or this year for long balls.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/tristan-wirfs-dealing-with-sore-knee-from-playing-on-turf/|Tristan Wirfs Dealing With Sore Knee From Playing On Turf|Bucs left tackle Tristan Wirfs was bouncing around the locker room today at One Buc Palace. Bouncing in that he was pretty mobile (and chipper) despite wearing a huge knee brace. Wirfs said he will be good to go Sunday against the Raiders just like he was last week at Carolina. Only this time, Wirfs is looking forward to playing on grass. The Stinking Panthers back in 2021 tore out the grass turf of Bank of America Stadium and installed artificial turf to save on maintenance — courtesy of one of the richest owners in the NFL, David Tepper, said to be worth some $20 billion. (FYI, Gracie Hunt will someday inherit an empire currently valued at $24 billion. And people wonder why Joe calls Drew Lock the ultimate dumbass.) Why does Joe bring up Tepper and his football field? Because it helped aggravate an injury to Wirfs, one of the best players on the Bucs roster. Wirfs was asked about his injured knee today (since nobody could miss that big, black thing on his leg). Wirfs suffered a knee sprain against the 49ers right before the Bucs’ bye week. The Carolina game was Wirfs’ first start since the injury. “Playing 80-some plays on the turf made it a little sore,” Wirfs confessed. “But I’m OK, just trying to rest it.” Now this is a pet peeve of Joe’s. How is it so many owners who have open-air stadiums don’t need turf yet Tepper, who wipes his rear end each morning with $100 bills, can’t afford a natural grass field? In Carolina no less! But of course, when Euro kickball teams come over to America to play in Tepper’s crib, he’s only too happy to rip out the artificial turf and replace it with natural grass (Carolina blue grass?). This is an outrage! Tepper and the Stinking Panthers are the main tenant of that stadium. A crib in which his employees play 10 times a year (including two worthless preseason games). They can’t have natural grass? But the Euro kickballers can? This is just unbelievable to Joe. And remember, it’s not just Tepper’s players. It’s opponents like Wirfs and the Bucs, too. Joe has no idea if the turf made Wirfs’ injury more painful or increased his recovery time, but that could be a major issue for the Bucs as they desperately are clutching to playoff hopes down the stretch. Joe is all for an 18-game schedule. In fact, if it rids our republic of the stain of worthless preseason games, then Joe is 100 percent behind a 20-game schedule. Joe hopes if the NFL does go to 18 games (or more) the players’ association forces, as a bargaining chip, NFL owners to have grass in all stadiums that don’t have a fixed-roof dome. Wirfs was adamant, even laughing about the idea that his injured knee may keep him off the field Sunday. But Joe didn’t find it the least bit charming that Tepper being such a cheapskate might indirectly cause Wirfs’ bum knee to linger. That just isn’t right!|2024-12-05 16:06:00|510|7|4|Tristan Wirfs|Wirfs dealing with sore knee from playing on turf.|5|Mixed sentiments with some negativity but also optimism and enthusiasm for football.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""LouisFriend"", ""post"": ""(FYI, Gracie Hunt will someday inherit an empire currently valued at $24 billion.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/mike-evans-im-getting-very-close/|Mike Evans: I’m Getting Very Close|So no deep shots have been thrown in a while to Mike Evans. Is it the offense? Joe’s not buying that. Joe is going with Evans’ health. Yes, Todd Bowles has said Evans has a “green light” on the field. And Buccaneers Ring of Honor said 11 days ago that Evans is “100 percent.” But Joe’s never swallowed that whole. Evans looks good, sure, but the Bucs clearly don’t want to throw him go routes. Today, Evans acknowledged he almost feels like himself — as he recovers from a hamstring injury that cost him three games. “I’m feeling good. I played close to 70 plays last game, felt in really good shape,” Evans said. “I’m getting very close.” There you go. “Getting very close” kind of says it all. Hopefully, the Bucs can jump on the bumbling, lost-eight-in-a-row Raiders on Sunday and not overwork Evans in the process. Joe has hope that Evans truly can get to 100 percent this month. If so, Joe is confident Evans will unleash a bucket of crazy against the Saints and Panther at home to close the season, as he pushes toward 1,000 or more receiving yards for the 11th consecutive season.|2024-12-05 15:39:00|198|13|7|Mike Evans|Mike Evans near full health|5|Mixed sentiments towards player performance and team, some concerns and hopes expressed.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""gbobucsfan"", ""post"": ""8 catches, 105 yards and 1 TD this week\u2026."", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""5th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""3:41"", ""pm""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""BucVoyager"", ""post"": ""He doesn\u2019t need deep throws, he needs numerous accurate throws.

The Bucs have a few dudes on the roster that played through The Lost Decade. Whether they want to admit it or not, bad teams often head in the wrong direction late in a season. Bucco Bruce Arians has been open about it. Another guy who speaks freely about the phenomenon of a crumbling team is Bucs receiver Sterling Shepard. He arrived this year after eight years with the bumbling Giants. Shepard reiterated yesterday how appreciative of the Bucs’ culture. Shepard loves the work ethic and steady approach that doesn’t have players hanging their heads. He said experience — Giants experience — tells him the Bucs are on the right track to finish strong. “I lost a lot of games with New York, unfortunately,” Shepard said with a smile. “But, you know, I’ve seen things go one or two directions; either everybody kind of goes downhill or you find a way to fix things. And with this team, that’s the mindset, that’s the mentality. ‘We’re going to get things going are way. We just got to keep stacking the days, stacking the practices.” Joe doesn’t doubt the Bucs’ drive and mentality. The mental toughness? That’s another story. Fans will learn a ton about the Bucs over the final five regular-season games. If they can’t play good football consistently now, against mostly weak opponents, then why expect it to happen next year with the same leadership?|2024-12-05 13:49:00|248|11|7|Sterling Shepard|NFL players' perspective on team resiliency and performance mindset.|3|Mixed sentiments, some doubt and concern but also optimism in certain comments.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""DavidBigBucsFan99"", ""post"": ""This is what will happen, Baker and the offense will struggle the better a defense is and our defense will struggle against any offense and so will our DC/HC.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/mike-evans-versus-a-fourth-round-rookie/|Mike Evans Versus A Fourth-Round Rookie|It’s Vegas week, so Joe has been immersed in all things Raiders. It’s not pretty, so Joe might need an extra shower, but it is a good thing for the Bucs. The Raiders have a ton of young players and backups on the field for their defense. Those defensive injuries have taken a toll, and they’re one reason Vegas has lost eight straight games. Listening to Raiders Rundown on the team website, Joe was intrigued by the excitement surrounding rookie Raiders fourth-round pick cornerback Decamerion Richardson squaring up Sunday against Mike Evans. Richardson, out of Mississippi State, has played in five games, has a couple of passes defensed and there’s some buzz in Vegas about how he’s played as a starter. Apparently, he matched up pretty well against Broncos WR Courtland Sutton two weeks ago, but keep in mind Richardson was the Vegas No. 4 cornerback entering this season. Joe heard all this and started to drool. Evans against a fourth-round rookie? In Tampa. Joe likes the sound of that. Evans hasn’t had back-to-back games of 100 or more yards receiving since 2020. Sunday could the next time he puts it on his resume.|2024-12-05 12:34:00|194|20|6|Mike Evans|Rookie cornerback challenges Evans in upcoming game.|7|Mixed sentiments with optimism and frustration about the team's performance and coaching.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""danbucsfan"", ""post"": ""Mike was nominated for Nfl man of the year earlier today.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/i-dont-watch-it/|“I Don’t Watch It”|Joe found this interesting because Buccaneers Ring of Honor general manager Jason Licht often talks about drafting players with a profound and deep love of football. Rachaad White was the Bucs’ third-round pick in 2022, and Joe certainly doesn’t question White’s work ethic and commitment. He’s clearly driven and White’s life story is one that let’s you know he’s pushed through a lot of challenges to be in the NFL. So it struck Joe when White told the Stacking The Box podcast that he doesn’t watch football in his free time. The host pressed White about keeping track of the Falcons in the standings. White said he doesn’t “check up on them” and doesn’t care. In fact, White said he doesn’t even celebrate a Falcons loss. “I’m really not watching football. Football’s not going to be on my TV,” White said. “… Thursday Night Football or Monday Night Football, I’m going to be honest with you. I’m not that type of guy; I don’t watch it.” White added that he watches film and cares deeply about all things Bucs, but that’s where it ends. He said he usually can be found playing a game with family (not football) when he’s out of One Buc Palace. Joe gets it, but it’s still hard to understand. Joe had a buddy who was a hell of a baseball pitcher for a state champion high school team and put serious time into his craft. Pro scouts took notice and the guy played minor league ball, but he didn’t watch professional baseball. Disinterested, even when he was in the minors. Hey, not being a football junkie is working for White. He’s a pro on his way to a second contract. Whatever works.|2024-12-05 12:05:00|287|21|5|Rachaad White|Non-football-watching NFL star player defies typical expectations.|5|Mixed opinions on football as work vs. passion, understanding different perspectives and disillusionment.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""View from 132"", ""post"": ""I don\u2019t blame him at all.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/baker-mayfield-credits-offensive-teammates-for-having-another-career-year/|Baker Mayfield Credits Offensive Teammates For Having Another Career Year|Last year Baker Mayfield had a career-year. He threw for his most yards in a season (4,044) and his most touchdown passes (28). With five games still to play, Mayfield needs 1,010 passing yards and three touchdown passes to tie his 2023 output. So yesterday, Mayfield was asked if Bucs offensive coordinator Liam Coen was behind his even better numbers than last year. Mayfield didn’t deny Coen’s help but said the play of his teammates has allowed him to have maybe his best passing season. “The run game always helps out your pass game,” Mayfield said. “When you’re able to control the line of scrimmage, when your guys are breaking tackles like our guys are and those holes are opening up, so it opens up the pass game.” It doesn’t stop there with his teammates. How well prepared Coen has the offense each week has been a large factor in Mayfield having such a good season, he said. With the recent emergence of Bucky Irving, teams have no choice but to respect the run. More guys playing in the box on defense means looser coverage against Bucs receivers. Joe is focused on soaking up and enjoying the final five (?) weeks of Coen. Joe is pretty confident the Bucs will miss him when he’s gone.|2024-12-05 09:00:00|215|23|8|Baker Mayfield|Baker credits teammates for career year.|5|Some uncertainty and mixed opinions on coaching changes and player contracts.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""OHBucFan"", ""post"": ""Saints may very well try and poach Coen this offseason.

I don\u2019t know, but the Glazers must be thinking the same thing, how do we keep Coen?. Do we make him head coach, do we offer him a ton of money to stay with the hope of making him head coach down the line?. I don\u2019t know ,but imagine the Glazers are thinking the same thing!! I think based on production they make him head coach and add a top notch D cordinator. I believe teams have caught on to Bowles\u2019s scheme and he lacks the talent to implement it anyway. He refuses to change and I guess you can place blame on him and Light for failing to add a middlelinebacker, through trade, free agency and  or the draft. It is clear efforts to draft edge rushers has failed on a major level. However, overall Light has performed to well overall to be fired, so that leaves the HC. Anyway, two things are clear. The Bucs must keep this offense at it\u2019s high level and significant changes must be made to the defense. As J Baptista  recently said it does not bode well that Bowles a defensive coach now has such a poor defense. One thing is for sure changes in a major way are coming to this defense and it\u2019s coaches. Just a guess but seeing Coen promoted to HC, does not seem all that far fetched to me., given the alternatives. Do you let a great offensice cordinator walk and keep a defensive HC, whose defense is  performing at the bottom level of the NFL in nearly all catagories.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/wheres-the-complement/|Where’s The “Complement?”|So Buccaneers Ring of Honor general manager Jason Licht was very clear in the winter about one specific position. Licht said while tight end Cade Otton was consistent and emerging in 2023, Otton needed “a complement,” too — another tight end to take the load off him and be an option for Baker Mayfield. That brings Joe to second-year tight end Payne Durham. There’s nothing but love for Durham at One Buc Palace and Joe’s heard Todd Bowles say on his radio show that Durham is a weapon the Bucs can get more from. Licht’s been very upbeat about Durham, as well. Joe assesses Durham’s blocking as much improved this season. Bravo. But where is he in the passing game? Despite the Bucs losing Chris Godwin for the season and Mike Evans for a stretch, plus a massive decline in production from Trey Palmer (from 2023), Durham has only been targeted twice. He’s caught both balls and one was highlight-worthy against the Giants. Joe would say three of Durham’s seven career catches were special (video below), but the Bucs don’t throw to the guy. Durham lacks speed, but he’s shown a huge catch radius and good hands. Joe would love to see playcaller Liam Coen get a ball to Durham more than once every six games. |2024-12-05 08:03:00|216|21|6|Payne Durham|Bucs want more passes to Durham at tight end position.|3|Concerns about TE usage, play-calling, and player performance, but acknowledging overall offensive success.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""WillieBeamin8"", ""post"": ""I\u2019m a fan of Durham, but before we start focus on integrating him into the O, we need to get Otton the ball more.

And no coach alive wants to see one of his players hurt, especially the quarterback. But the way Bucs coach Todd Bowles spoke yesterday, it appears Baker Mayfield was too hyped for the game in Carolina last weekend and him getting stomped on by Jadeveon Clowney actually may have settled Mayfield down. Bowles was discussing how sluggish the Bucs mostly were in the first half but added Mayfield gathered himself after sitting out a couple of plays following Clowney cleating him in the hoof. “[Mayfield] getting hurt probably calmed him down and got him back refocused and recalibrated,” Bowles said. “He came back and he played a heck of a game coming back for us.” Well, Mayfield is certainly a quarterback who at times is running at 100 mph. That, at times, may not be a good thing. It was just weird to hear Bowles said how Mayfield got his head right after his right ankle got stomped on.|2024-12-05 07:00:00|170|26|5|Baker Mayfield|Mayfield injury may have helped refocus him before game.|3|Mixed sentiments towards Baker Mayfield's performance with some criticism and support from fans.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""StickinUp4Centers"", ""post"": ""Yeah that first play back was SUPER focused"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""5th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""7:10"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Mickman"", ""post"": ""Sometimes coaches say the dumbest things"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""5th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""7:18"", ""am""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""RagingBrisket"", ""post"": ""After he got stomped and then AFTER he rushed back in on 3rd and 1 to throw an egregious interception?

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/jose-ramirez-on-sam-franklin-he-just-needs-to-pray-more/|José Ramirez On Sam Franklin: “He Just Needs To Pray More”|So it still seems to be a mystery what exactly got into Stinking Panthers safety Sam Franklin after Sunday’s game with the Bucs. Apparently, Bucs outside linebacker José Ramirez and Franklin had an incident of some sort on the field. Ramirez was tight-lipped about the incident yesterday, or what may have sparked Franklin’s outburst near the Bucs’ postgame room at Bank of America Stadium. Video floated across Twitter Sunday of Franklin apparently hollering for Ramirez. Franklin charged at the Bucs’ locker room entrance hollering and was grabbed by a Stinking Panthers staffer and hauled away, all the while Franklin was woofing and pointing towards the Bucs who were exiting the field. Joe read from a Panthers credentialed media member that Franklin was going to try to bum rush his way into the Bucs’ locker room. Joe asked Ramirez about this Wednesday and Ramirez busted out laughing. “He ain’t getting in no locker room!” Ramirez said, guffawing. When Joe initially walked up to Ramirez, he said, “I already know what you are going to ask.” When Joe asked about Franklin, Ramirez began chuckling. It appears in one video of the hassle included Franklin hollered, “Hey, tell 33 imma see his ass,” Franklin said, pointing toward Tampa Bay players. “On my grave, boy!” The “33” is Ramirez’s number. Something clearly set off Franklin but Ramirez refused to offer Joe any clue what may have ignited his temper. “Naw, we’re just playing football, you know,” Ramirez said. “Lot of football going on.” Ramirez and Franklin play defense. So if the two had an altercation on the field Sunday, maybe it came on special teams. Ramirez played 13 snaps on special teams Sunday. Franklin had 29. Franklin, who played at Temple, is a fifth-year veteran. Ramirez is in his second year and he played at Eastern Michigan. So the two didn’t cross paths in college. Franklin went to Citrus High in Crystal River. Ramirez went to school at Auburndale. So Joe isn’t sure if the two had old high school grudges to settle. Joe asked Ramirez why Franklin got so upset. Ramirez had a cryptic response. “I don’t know, he just needs to pray more,” Ramirez said. “Find God. Once you find God, all that emotion and all that — you can be an emotional person but you’ll be able to handle all that emotion that’s in you.” Franklin, per Charean Williams of Pro Football Talk, was contrite about his part in the hassle saying, “That kind of stuff isn’t accepted in the NFL. Regardless of what happened on the field, we’ve got to keep those things in between the lines. It can’t spill out into the locker room or afterward, so I’d just like to apologize to the organization, my teammates and the owner, because that’s not how we want to view ourselves as professional athletes.” Like Ramirez, Franklin wouldn’t go into details. Per Williams, Franklin and Stinking Panthers coach Dave Canales had a sitdown about the incident, and Franklin said he will accept a fine from the league if he is slapped with one.|2024-12-05 03:45:00|512|24|4|José Ramirez|Altercation with Sam Franklin leads to locker room incident.|4|Mixed opinions on prayer and personal beliefs, some hostility, a few positive comments scattered throughout.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Jeffrey Becker"", ""post"": ""prayer therapy haha. whatever works man"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""5th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""5:45"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""#99 the big fella"", ""post"": ""Jeffrey Becker, try it sometime ,you might not think it\u2019s so funny.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/bucky-irving-makes-defenders-miss-at-historic-rate/|Bucky Irving Makes Defenders Miss At Historic Rate|This is absolutely wild to Joe. One of the reasons Joe has been down for a couple of years on running back Rachaad White is that when he runs between the tackles, he couldn’t make a mailbox miss. And yes, NFL strongman Roger Goodell still allows running backs to dodge defenders and make dudes miss. Joe checked on this with the league office. White’s teammate Bucky Irving? He’s a forced missed tackle from the instant he touches the ball. Several in fact. Last night the Bucs twittered out this wild, crazy stat from NextGen Stats about Irving and missed tackles. Let’s just say the NFL hasn’t seen a running back like Irving in seven years. Per NextGen Stats, 59.7 percent of would-be tacklers whiff when they try to bring Irving to the ground. Yes, that’s over half of defenders that go after Irving, he jukes his way out of danger. That’s nuts! Also per NextGen Stats, that is the highest percentage of forced missed tackles by any NFL running back (with at least 50 carries) since 2016. Joe thinks it is now safe to say that Irving, a fourth-round pick, was a home run selection. Another crazy thing for Joe related to Irving: He is still not the Bucs’ starting running back. After reading this stat that NextGen Stats pumped out and witnessing what Irving has done the past two games, Joe thinks it’s time to start calling for Irving to be named to the Pro Bowl team.|2024-12-05 00:00:00|248|28|9|Bucky Irving|Dynamic running back excels at making defenders miss tackles consistently.|6|Mixed sentiment with some positivity but also criticism and uncertainty.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Bucswin!"", ""post"": ""We should be unstoppable on 3rd, 4th down and short.
