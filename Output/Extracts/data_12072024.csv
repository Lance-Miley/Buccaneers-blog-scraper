https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/cleanup-needed/|Cleanup Needed|So lost in the ecstasy of the Bucs win against the Giants two weeks ago was the reality that the Bucs fumbled four times in that game. Last week’s win in Charlotte saw two more fumbles for the men in pewter and white. Thankfully, the football gods were kind and the Bucs recovered nearly all those fumbles, but it was/is a little concerning. However, ball security can be coached up with improvement expected. Tonight, Joe watched game film of the past two Bucs games and afterwards felt compelled to look up fumbling stats. Per NFL.com the Bucs lead the NFL in running game fumbles this season with 11, after only 4 last year. Ouch! The Cowboys have the second-most with 9. The NFL team average is about 5 1/2 for this season. Obviously, this is something the Bucs must correct before bouncing balls further short-circuit the season. (See Falcons-Bucs on Oct. 3). But the good news is there’s reason to expect the Bucs to be sharper with the football after two messy weeks, especially at home with fewer distractions. If not, fumbling issues are sure to catch up to the team, and Anthony Nelson can’t be counted on for a bailout every week.|2024-12-07 22:10:00|203|3|4|The Bucs|Bucs struggling with fumbles but can improve with coaching.|2|Mixed opinions on fumbling issues and coaching errors, pointing to potential challenges ahead.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""garro"", ""post"": ""Good stuff Joe.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/a-get-off-my-back-game-for-todd-bowles/|A Get-Off-My-Back Game For Todd Bowles|So back on Sept. 5, Tampa Bay fans here were hit with a flash poll and asked the question, ‘How many regular season wins for the Bucs this season?’ With about 90 minutes to respond on a Thursday morning, the most popular answer was “10,” the choice of 45.4 percent of the 735 respondents. Bucs fans were optimistic, and rightfully so. The team finished the 2023 season on a high note, the new playcaller was inspiring confidence, free agency locked in Bucs stars, the draft from the A-list general manager felt solid and the division didn’t look strong. Bring on a fourth consecutive NFC South crown! But here the Bucs are at 6-6. It’s a solid record considering their tough schedule and key injuries, but it’s a painful record because of how the team lost to the Falcons twice — after knocking off the Lions and Eagles. If ever there was a rollercoaster season, this has been it. And it started on Day 1 with fans expecting double-digit wins. Keep in mind a combined 38 percent of fans voting in the poll pegged the Bucs at 11, 12 or 13-plus wins this season. Optimism was flowing and the Bucs life felt great. Today, Joe sees the team and legions of Bucs fans at a crossroads. A majority are down on Todd Bowles, but he’s got a chance Sunday to flip a ton of skeptics. Put this Bucs team at 7-6 and in great position to meet preseason expectations after a solid beating of the Raiders, and Joe thinks a lot of daggers (not all) will stop being thrown Bowles’ way. The this year’s 4-6 record felt inexcusable based on how it evolved, but getting to 7-6 would feel mighty acceptable, almost like a rightful December reset for a team with a lot of weapons and a lot of holes. A “W” tomorrow would/should get a lot of fans off Bowles’ back. But an unthinkable home loss to a miserable Raiders team? Well, that would be one heavy load for Bowles to shed in the coming weeks.

And there is video out there floating on the interwebs of Irving walking back to the Bucs’ locker room Sunday night after the Bucs beat the Stinking Panthers with him wearing some sort of body wrap. Asked if he is alright, Irving sharply barks back, “F’ no!” So there was a question whether Irving could play on Sunday. He missed two practices this week and on Friday, Irving was limited. Well, BSPN NFL insider Jeremy Fowler proclaims Irving will suit up and hit the field for an important game with the Raiders.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/orlovsky-on-coen/|Dan Orlovsky Very Impressed With Liam Coen|Really cool stuff here that demonstrates how savvy Bucs offensive coordinator Liam Coen is. The Joe typing this here posts has been pretty clear the past month or so thinking Coen, the first-year Bucs playcaller, will be a head coach next year somewhere. Could be in the NFL. Could be in college. He is that good. And it seems, so too does former Bucs backup quarterback Dan Orlovsky. The current BSPN talking head did a video X’s and O’s breakdown of how Coen uses pre-snap motion to set up the Bucs’ run game. Basically, Coen is able to create mismatches on the offensive line with tight ends in motion as well as pulling tackles and even guards, often using wham blocks to spring Bucky Irving. And the way Irving makes guys miss, getting him against a linebacker on the second level is often not a fair fight, as Bucco Bruce Arians would say. Orlovsky is fully impressed with Coen and referred to him to a current NFL offensive wizard. “He reminds me a little of a young Matt LeFleur,” Orlovsky said. “And we have to talk more about him and what he is doing using motion at the snap in Tampa’s run game to create advantages.” Orlovsky seems to think Coen is sort of cutting edge when it comes to designing runs with pre-snap motion. “Liam Coen, remember the name,” Orlovsky said.|2024-12-07 18:03:00|232|13|9|Liam Coen|Impressed by Coen's innovative use of pre-snap motion.|4|Fans express concern about losing Coen but show appreciation for his impact on the team.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""gotbbucs"", ""post"": ""They absolutely can not let him get away.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/shakeup-to-injury-report/|Shakeup To Injury Report|Boy, oh boy are the Bucs hurting at inside linebacker. Pray for Lavonte David. If he goes down, this defense may be fully screwed. The Bucs were thin at inside linebacker before the season began. It’s only grown worse thanks to injuries and exposure — with the exception of David. Already SirVocea Dennis and K.J. Britt were out for tomorrow’s game against the Raiders. Now, add backup inside linebacker J.J. Russell (hamstring) to the list. The Bucs downgraded Russell along with corner Josh Hayes (hamstring) and outside linebacker Joe Tryon-Shoyinka (ankle) to out for Sunday. So now the Bucs will rely on Vi Jones to play alongside David, a guy who was on the Bucs’ roster for damn near a year before Bucs coach Todd Bowles deemed him “ready” to take the field. Joe has never heard of a guy who needed damn near a full year of practice before he was “ready” to play.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/liam-coen-in-some-impressive-company/|Liam Coen In Impressive Company|Joe thinks it’s fair to suggest Andy Reid may be the best offensive coach in the NFL. Not long ago he had one of the most potent offenses in the game. After attrition, injury and age, Reid and his Chiefs are left with a world-class quarterback, an aging star tight end and not much else, yet Reid and his Chiefs’ offense move the ball. The Chiefs convert 52 percent of their third downs, per Rich Hribar of Sharp Football Analysis. That’s best in the league. This does not shock Joe one bit. Reid simply knows how to put offenses together and craft gameplans. He will be in the Pro Football Hall of Fame someday. Deservedly. Well, guess who is No. 2 in the league in converting third downs? That would be Liam Coen and the Bucs. And yes, it surprises Joe — even though their third-down success is mentioned on every broadcast and pregame show. The Bucs aren’t too far behind, converting 48 percent of their third downs. Joe would suspect that’s a great look for Baker Mayfield, as well. He’s the one on the field executing the Coen’s plays and audibling out of them when needed. And, yeah, Mayfield has the third-most touchdown passes in the NFL (25), second-most 300-yard passing games (four) and second-most three-touchdown passing games (five). Not bad for the 18th-highest-paid quarterback. And definitely not bad for a first-time NFL playcaller like Coen.|2024-12-07 10:15:00|237|36|8|Liam Coen|Coen impresses with Bucs' third-down conversion rate.|6|Overall positive sentiments toward the coaches and offensive improvements.

Every game here on out is a big game for the Bucs. But sadly for Bucs fans, very few will be able to enjoy Sunday’s Bucs-Raiders game by watching free on their local CBS affiliate. Save for the Tampa Bay TV market, Oklahoma, Nevada and pockets of Northern California, the only way to watch the Raiders-Bucs game for many will be their neighborhood sports bar or Sunday Ticket. The lower-level CBS crew of Spero Dedes, Adam Archuleta, Aditi Kinkhabwala will call tomorrow’s game, scheduled for a 1 p.m. kickoff.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/sneaky-weapon-jakobi-meyers/|Sneaky Raiders Weapon Could Be Unleashed|While the Bucs should be focused on stud rookie tight end Brock Bowers (or for that matter talented second-year tight end Michael Mayer) that just may allow a guy in the slot to sneak up on the Bucs and burn their underbelly (middle of the field). That would be receiver Jakobi Meyers. As Mason Cameron of the PFF tribe points out, since Week 11, Meyers has come alive with new Raiders offensive coordinator Scott Turner. In that timeframe, Meyers has six catches of 15 or more yards. Turner likes to use Meyers out of a slot. That means Meyers, in a perfect world, would go up against Tykee Smith on Sunday. However, it’s unknown if Smith will play. He’s a gametime decision, Bucs coach Todd Bowles said yesterday. So if the Bucs go with Christian Izien, would Turner try to sneakily matchup Meyers on a backup nickel corner as the Bucs likely will be so focused on Bowers? Izien has played solid ball this year. Still, he’s a backup. If Smith doesn’t start, Joe fully expects Izien to get tested.|2024-12-07 10:00:00|180|20|7|Jakobi Meyers|Meyers could exploit Bucs defense weakness in slot matchup.|4|Mixed sentiment with criticism towards Jeff and positive comments about team strategies and performance.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Jeff"", ""post"": ""Clueless Todd and his staff of losers won\u2019t be able to stop the Raiders."", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""7th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""10:11"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Woodenman"", ""post"": ""Thanks Jeff like your consistency."", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""7th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""10:18"", ""am""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""John Sinclear"", ""post"": ""Suggestion for Jeff \u2013 If you are so much smarter and more capable than Coach, why don\u2019t you submit your resume to Joel Glazer for the head coaching job?

(When Joe actually used to watch SportsCenter around the turn of the century, whenever Cohn said, “In case you were wondering… ” Joe always thought, “Actually, no, I wasn’t wondering.”) So in case you were wondering, Bucs defensive tackle Calijah Kancey is on a roll. The sackmeister has been tearing up offensive linemen of late. Kancey has had a sack in each of his last four games and a total of five in those games and six this season. If he keeps this up, he may just have double-digit sacks. And  Joe figures, Kancey ought to get a sack tomorrow when the Bucs host the Raiders at The Licht House. The Raiders have one of the worst pass-blocking units in the game. Or at least they cough up a lot of sacks. The Raiders have given up 41 so far this season. That ranks No. 27 in the NFL. Of course, this also means Vita Vea could manhandle some poor soul wearing the eyepatch on his helmet, too. Edge rush? Pffttt. Joe’s given up on that. If the Bucs get a sack from an edge rusher, that’s either an accident or an offensive tackle tripped over his own feet.|2024-12-07 08:00:00|209|13|6|Calijah Kancey|Defensive tackle in good form with potential for more sacks.|4|Mixed sentiments with some optimism about acquisitions and draft picks balanced by criticism of defense.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Lt.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2024/12/tristan-wirfs-on-his-way-to-all-pro-honor/|Tristan Wirfs On His Way To All-Pro Honor?|Though allowing a sack is not an official NFL statistic, Joe seemed to think early this season Bucs left tackle Tristan Wirfs gave up a sack. Again, sacks allowed by linemen are not an official stat. A couple of guys have tried to guess on who to blame for those stats, but that’s what that is. A guess. (As an NFL general manager once told Joe, an offensive lineman’s assignment is not known to fans on particular play. Fair.) Over at Mike Tannenbaum’s outfit, “The 33rd Team,” NFL analyst and high school coach Tyler Brooke seems to believe he has a handle on offensive line stats. And one is very good for Wirfs. Brooke is of the mind that Wirfs is having one of the best years of any offensive lineman in the NFL. So much so Brooke thinks Wirfs will be selected as an All-Pro next month. Tristan Wirfs is the only OT with less than 10 Pressures allowed this season (7) that has had 400+ pass blocking snaps 🛡️ A literal human shield. Brooke also notes that his information suggests Wirfs has yet to give up a sack this fall. Regardless, Wirfs is a monster. He’s worth every penny. Because of Wirfs and right tackle Luke Goedeke’s return missing four games with a concussion, the Bucs’ offensive line has developed into a force. With Wirfs and Goedeke, the Bucs may have the best tackles duo in the league.|2024-12-07 00:00:00|240|15|9|Tristan Wirfs|Wirfs excels|8|Positive sentiment with confidence in offensive line's abilities, cautious optimism, and support for players.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""OR Buc"", ""post"": ""Tristan is the best, hands down."", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""7th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""12:56"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""MadMax"", ""post"": ""Told you try him at LT \ud83d\ude42"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""7th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""1:16"", ""am""]}, ""commenter2"": {""username"": ""adam from ny"", ""post"": ""tristan & the glass eater are the best book end combo in the nfl\u2026"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""7th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""4:00"", ""am""]}, ""commenter3"": {""username"": ""adam from ny"", ""post"": ""and hopefully you keep the versatile back up hainsey on emergency call"", ""post_time"": [""December"", ""7th,"", ""2024"", ""at"", ""4:01"", ""am""]}, ""commenter4"": {""username"": ""garro"", ""post"": ""First thing I look at was the play itself Joe.
