https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/he-played-like-he-was-a-10-year-vet/|“He Played Like He Was A 10-Year Vet”|What a great example of the cold business of the NFL embedded in this Todd Bowles comment. And no, it has nothing to do with El Serpiente, departed offensive coordinator Liam Coen. Bowles talked about his safeties on the Buccaneers Radio Network and gushed about second-year man Kaevon Merriweather, who joined the Bucs as an undrafted free agent in 2023. Bowles said “Kaevon’s been great all year.” Meanwhile, Merriweather was cut by the Bucs in November. Merriweather signed onto the Lions’ practice squad and the Bucs brought him back two weeks later. Joe can’t say Merriweather was “great” last season, but Joe agrees with Bowles’ assessment that he looked like a new player — a faster, better player — after his short trip to Detroit. “Since the second half of the season when we got him back, he’s probably one of the smartest and most cerebral guys we have back there,” Bowles said. “The last couple of weeks of the season, he really carved out a niche for himself and [was] very consistent. I was very happy and very proud of the way he came back and played. He played like he was a 10-year vet” Joe’s glad to hear about Merriweather’s growth, and count on seeing Merriweather all over the field when the Bucs next play in the 2025 preseason.|2025-01-25 14:41:00|221|53|7|Kaevon Merriweather|Merriweather impresses despite ups and downs in NFL season.|2|Mixed sentiments about defensive coaches, defense performance, and Bowles' coaching abilities.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""stpetebucsfan"", ""post"": ""I think anybody who has tried to master something has some aha moments where the bulb just goes on.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/dan-orlovsky-promotes-mike-greenberg-to-follow-liam-coen-to-jacksonville/|Dan Orlovsky Promotes Mike Greenberg To Follow Liam Coen To Jacksonville|So Joe spent time to figure out what allegations were and were not true afer all the accusations thrown out in the past 48 hours about what Jags coach and former Bucs offensive coordinator Liam Coen did or didn’t do — as he went from a $4 million a year coordinator with the Bucs to allegedly a $13 Million Dollar Man (per year) head coach. There were very ugly allegations, including Coen allegedly using his sick child as a shield to dodge the Bucs. Whenever someone’s child is involved in finger-pointing, that’s low and Joe has no idea if the story is true. (This is why Joe has used the word “allegedly”). Joe brings this up because  Dan Orlovsky took to TikTok and noted the biggest winner in the Coen drama is Jags quarterback Trevor Lawrence. The former Bucs quarterback also noted that he would not be one bit surprised if Coen, who now has power to influence Shad Con Khan on hiring a general manager, might bring Bucs assistant general manager Mike Greenberg to Jacksonville. Orlovsky said that would be a really good marriage. He spoke highly of Greenberg and it made Joe wonder if Greenberg, hired by former Bucs rock star general manager Mark Dominik in 2010, was involved with signing Orlovsky in 2012. However, the new rancor that now exists between the Jags and the Bucs over the recruiting of Coen makes Orlovsky wonder if Greenberg would even want to go to Jacksonville. For Joe, a Greenberg move or non-move could be telling as it relates to what really happened this week. If it is learned Greenberg turns down the Jags after Coen tries to coax him across the state, that might be a dead giveaway something bad happened between Coen and the Bucs and Greenberg wants to keep his distance. After all, it’s no secret Greenberg wants a general manager job, too.|2025-01-25 11:00:00|316|67|3|Mike Greenberg|Coen drama leads to speculation about Greenberg joining Jacksonville.|3|Mixed sentiments reflect uncertainty and skepticism over personnel changes and organizational stability.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Josh"", ""post"": ""I would be very surprised if any long-time Buccaneers staff members left to join him.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/baker-mayfield-should-have-heaviest-hand-on-offensive-coordinator-choice/|Baker Mayfield Should Have Heaviest Hand On Offensive Coordinator Choice|One NFL certainty in a sea of snakes and clowns is that Baker Mayfield is severely underpaid. He’s played the past two seasons like a top-10 quarterback but this year earned about $20 million less than the average salary of the top 10 highest-paid QBs. That bargain won’t last forever. Mayfield has two more seasons remaining on his contract (2025 and 2026) and Joe thinks Mayfield would have massive demand in free agency. Just look at all the Sean McVay disciples around the NFL in head coach positions and calling plays. Mayfield is proven in that system and he only turns 30 in April. That means the Bucs need to create an environment that keeps Mayfield happy and wanting to stay in Tampa. If Mayfield doesn’t respect and love his new offensive coordinator before he’s hired, then that could become an issue on so many levels. Damn, Joe doesn’t want to think about what could go wrong, especially knowing Todd Bowles enters the 2025 season with massive expectations on his back from fans and the Bucs heirarchy. The Bucs acknowledged that Mayfield was a key cog in choosing Liam Coen a year ago. Mayfield’s role needs to get even stronger this time around. It’s what makes it easy to point to guys Mayfield has worked with, assistant coaches like Jake Peetz in Seattle and Alex Van Pelt, just launched from the Patriots’ regime, and in-house candidate Thad Lewis, the Bucs’ quarterback coach. Or, as Joe was dead serious about, USC head coach Lincoln Riley.|2025-01-25 10:32:00|254|71|7|Baker Mayfield|Mayfield's value and future with new offensive coordinator in question.|4|Mixed sentiments about OC search and Baker's influence, with some optimism and skepticism present.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""OHBucFan"", ""post"": ""Todd did well with Canales and great with Coen.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/first-bucs-oc-candidate-surfaces/|First Bucs OC Candidate Surfaces|When Joe learned Liam Coen was the ex-Bucs offensive coordinator, Joe threw out the name of Lincoln Riley to replace him. “Go big!” Joe thought. Now, initially, it seems the Bucs are looking for something less dramatic. Per Jeremy Fowler of ESPN, the Bucs like the Sean McVay tree from which Coen came. So the Bucs have requested to interview Rams offensive assistant Nate Scheelhaase. The former Illinois quarterback has only been with the Rams one year. Before that, he spent five years calling plays for Matt Campbell at Iowa State. (Joe knows a lot of football people are enamored with Campbell. Joe is underwhelmed. Look how Brock Purdy regressed each season under Campbell. The guy went from looking like a future star as a freshman to Mr. Irrelevent. But to be fair, Campbell is doing a solid job with Anthony Becht’s son, Rocco Becht.) Of course, the Bucs are banking that McVay rubbed off on Scheelhaase. Scheelhaase, 34, also was an offensive assistant at Illinois under Lovie Smith.|2025-01-25 10:20:00|169|68|5|Liam Coen|Bucs looking at Rams' Nate Scheelhaase for OC role.|4|Mixed views on OC search with concern for defensive improvements and past OC choices.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Couch Fan"", ""post"": ""They seem to be obsessed with the Rams coaching tree but I guess if it worked twice, keep on going."", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""25th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""10:23"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Rover"", ""post"": ""Back to the pits we go until we find a Defensive Coordinator!

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/jeff-darlington-liam-coen-may-have-been-two-bucs-losses-away-from-being-bucs-head-coach/|Jeff Darlington: Liam Coen May Have Been Two Losses Away From Being Bucs Head Coach|Joe fully understands the majority of Bucs fans reading this here site wanted Todd Bowles to either retire or get bounced by Team Glazer. Shoot, Joe even saw a few readers hoping the Bucs would get blown out by the Commandos because that might jolt Team Glazer into action and chase off Bowles. It wasn’t so much these folks were anti-Bowles. It is that they were far more pro-Liam Coen. And a guy who has deep connections in high places with the Bucs, the pride of Seminole High School, Jeff Darlington of ESPN, took to Twitter yesterday and suggested had the Bucs lost two more games this past season, instead of finishing 10-7 but ending the regular season at 8-9, there was a real chance Coen would now be the head coach of the Bucs and not the Jags. Had Bowles’ team not made the playoffs, there was a very real world where Coen replaced him. So earlier this week, the Bucs thought they avoided the Catch-22 when Coen still agreed to stay as the OC while retaining Bowles. But the Jaguars job, without Trent Balke, was viewed by several top coaching candidates as the top gig. That’s what makes this situation so twisted: It took someone to fire someone (Balke or Bowles) to land or keep Coen. That’s an uncomfortable space for any team to live — but not completely foreign to Tampa Bay after some strange times with Brady/Arians/Leftwich. In this scenario, the Bucs opted against the sacrifice. The Jaguars sent Balke packing. And the next several seasons will reveal which conviction proves fruitful. On face value, this would seem like a bombshell but it’s not. In the final six weeks or so of the season, Joe started snooping and talking to various suits trying to gauge Bowles’ job security. Joe was mostly met with laughter. The common refrain was either, “We’re winning,” or “The season’s not over.” The hint being if the Bucs had a winning record, there would be no regime change, which seemed reasonable. (Joe pretty much typed that and spoke that on Ira Kaufman’s podcast, as did Ira, and Joe was raked over the coals for weeks by readers because Joe did not pander to some readers’ prurient desires and hatch a false narrative by conning fans.) So in the end, Coen may have been too good to stay in Tampa Bay. There is no way the Bucs make the playoffs without Coen working magic on his side of the ball. That bought Bowles job security. And eventually, that made Coen a $13 Million Dollar Man in Jacksonville.  |2025-01-25 06:00:00|434|117|4|Liam Coen|Bucs' close call with potential coaching change.|4|Mixed feelings with skepticism about Coen, frustration, and a call to move on.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""Permanently Moderated"", ""post"": ""What is the status of the search for a new OC?"", ""post_time"": [""January"", ""25th,"", ""2025"", ""at"", ""6:06"", ""am""]}, ""commenter1"": {""username"": ""Pahpahmike"", ""post"": ""Enough of Coen,  who\u2019s to say if the Bucs had fired Bowles or had he retired that Coen was gonna be the next A Reid.

https://www.joebucsfan.com/2025/01/a-window-into-liam-coen-one-year-ago/|A Window Into Liam Coen One Year Ago|Joe understands yesterday was Liam Coen Hate Day. Bucs fans had a full 24 hours to vent after the shocking Thursday news. The second-best offensive coordinator in team history bolted in the dead of the night to Jacksonville to take over the Jags. Some fans pointed to Coen’s resume. Virtually every year, it appears Coen leaves for a new job. Hey, if someone is going to pay the freight, why not? Now a bit of background. Some of Joe’s readers may have heard of Matt Jones, the founder and on-air big shot of Kentucky Sports Radio. It’s syndicated sports radio for the Commonwealth of Kentucky focusing mainly on the University of Kentucky and specifically, Kentucky basketball (though it does dabble in Louisville sports as well). Curiously, Jones is a Duke grad. Jones is a big fish in a small lake. He’s sort of Kentucky’s version of the late, great “Big Dog,” Steve Duemig, the former dean of local Tampa Bay sports radio. So anything that moves or breaths on the Kentucky campus when it comes to basketball and football, Jones knows about it. Or he will talk about it. Last year, Jones saw breaking news on Twitter that the Bucs were after Coen for offensive coordinator. At the time, Coen was the offensive coordinator at Kentucky. Jones was in Manhattan. He retweeted the breaking news. Shortly thereafter, Jones recalled on his radio show yesterday, Coen called Jones and chewed him out for retweeting that item telling Jones he wasn’t going anywhere. Jones apologized for the retweet. Two hours later, Jones said, the Bucs announced Coen was the team’s new offensive coordinator. You can hear Jones tell the story in the video below. But it sounds a little like what transpired this week between Coen and the Bucs, doesn’t it?|2025-01-25 00:00:00|299|35|3|Liam Coen|Coen's sudden move sparks mixed reactions and controversy.|4|Mixed emotions, disappointment, resentment, and some understanding expressed by commenters.|"{""commenter0"": {""username"": ""FortMyersDave"", ""post"": ""Leopards do not change their spots.

He spent the day in full communication with Shad Khan and he used the Bucs new offer to strong arm Jacksonville into Ben Johnson numbers.
